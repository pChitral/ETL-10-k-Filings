1283699,TMUS,"T-Mobile US, Inc.",2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Company Overview Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are those of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are a wireless telecommunications carrier that currently offers wireless broadband personal communication services, or PCS, primarily in the greater Atlanta, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Miami, San Francisco, Sacramento and Tampa/Sarasota/Orlando metropolitan areas. We launched service in the greater Atlanta, Miami and 54 Table of Contents Sacramento metropolitan areas in the first quarter of 2002; in San Francisco in September 2002; in Tampa/Sarasota in October 2005; in Dallas/Ft. Worth in March 2006; in Detroit in April 2006; and Orlando in November 2006. In 2005, Royal Street Communications, LLC or Royal Street Communications, a company in which we own 85% of the limited liability company member interests and with which we have a wholesale arrangement allowing us to sell MetroPCS-branded services to the public, was granted licenses by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, in Los Angeles and various metropolitan areas throughout northern Florida. Royal Street is in the process of constructing its network infrastructure in its licensed metropolitan areas. We commenced commercial services in Orlando and certain portions of northern Florida in November 2006 and we expect to begin offering services in Los Angeles in the second or third quarter of 2007 through our arrangements with Royal Street Communications. As a result of the significant growth we have experienced since we launched operations, our results of operations to date are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected in future periods. Moreover, we expect that our number of customers will continue to increase, which will continue to contribute to increases in our revenues and operating expenses. In November 2006, we were granted advanced wireless services, or AWS, licenses covering a total unique population of approximately 117 million for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion. Approximately 69 million of the total licensed population associated with our Auction 66 licenses represents expansion opportunities in geographic areas outside of our Core and Expansion Markets, which we refer to as our Auction 66 Markets. These new expansion opportunities in our Auction 66 Markets cover six of the 25 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. The balance of our Auction 66 Markets, which cover a population of approximately 48 million, supplements or expands the geographic boundaries of our existing operations in Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento. We currently plan to focus on building out approximately 40 million of the total population in our Auction 66 Markets with a primary focus on the New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Las Vegas metropolitan areas. Of the approximate 40 million total population, we are targeting launch of operations with an initial covered population of approximately 30 to 32 million by late 2008 or early 2009. Total estimated capital expenditures to the launch of these operations are expected to be between $18 and $20 per covered population, which equates to a total capital investment of approximately $550 million to $650 million. Total estimated expenditures, including capital expenditures, to become free cash flow positive, defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures, is expected to be approximately $29 to $30 per covered population, which equates to $875 million to $1.0 billion based on an estimated initial covered population of approximately 30 to 32 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, proceeds from our currently pending initial public offering, and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fully fund this planned expansion. We sell products and services to customers through our Company-owned retail stores as well as indirectly through relationships with independent retailers. We offer service which allows our customers to place unlimited local calls from within our local service area and to receive unlimited calls from any area while in our local service area, through flat rate monthly plans starting at $30 per month. For an additional $5 to $20 per month, our customers may select a service plan that offers additional services, such as unlimited nationwide long distance service, voicemail, caller ID, call waiting, text messaging, mobile Internet browsing, push e-mail and picture and multimedia messaging. We offer flat rate monthly plans at $30, $35, $40, $45 and $50 as fully described under “Business — MetroPCS Service Plans.” All of these plans require payment in advance for one month of service. If no payment is made in advance for the following month of service, service is discontinued at the end of the month that was paid for by the customer. For additional fees, we also provide international long distance and text messaging, ringtones, games and content applications, unlimited directory assistance, ring back tones, nationwide roaming and other value-added services. As of December 31, 2006, over 85% of our customers have selected either our $40 or $45 rate plans. Our flat rate plans differentiate our service from the more complex plans and long-term contract requirements of traditional wireless carriers. In addition the above products and services are offered by us in the Royal Street markets. Our arrangements with Royal Street are based on a wholesale model under which we purchase network capacity from Royal Street to allow us to offer our standard products and services in the Royal Street markets to MetroPCS customers under the MetroPCS brand name. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. You should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related 55 Table of Contents disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Our wireless services are provided on a month-to-month basis and are paid in advance. We recognize revenues from wireless services as they are rendered. Amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Suspending service for non-payment is known as hotlining. We do not recognize revenue on hotlined customers. Revenues and related costs from the sale of accessories are recognized at the point of sale. The cost of handsets sold to indirect retailers are included in deferred charges until they are sold to and activated by customers. Amounts billed to indirect retailers for handsets are recorded as accounts receivable and deferred revenue upon shipment by us and are recognized as equipment revenues when service is activated by customers. Our customers have the right to return handsets within a specified time or after a certain amount of use, whichever occurs first. We record an estimate for returns as contra-revenue at the time of recognizing revenue. Our assessment of estimated returns is based on historical return rates. If our customers’ actual returns are not consistent with our estimates of their returns, revenues may be different than initially recorded. Effective July 1, 2003, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 00-21, “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” (“EITF No. 00-21”), which is being applied on a prospective basis. EITF No. 00-21 also supersedes certain guidance set forth in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,” (“SAB 101”). SAB 101 was amended in December 2003 by Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 104, “Revenue Recognition.” The consensus addresses the accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting and the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values. We determined that the sale of wireless services through our direct and indirect sales channels with an accompanying handset constitutes revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. Upon adoption of EITF No. 00-21, we began dividing these arrangements into separate units of accounting, and allocating the consideration between the handset and the wireless service based on their relative fair values. Consideration received for the handset is recognized as equipment revenue when the handset is delivered and accepted by the customer. Consideration received for the wireless service is recognized as service revenues when earned. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our independent retailers to pay for equipment purchases and for amounts estimated to be uncollectible for intercarrier compensation. We estimate allowances for uncollectible accounts from independent retailers based on the length of time the receivables are past due, the current business environment and our historical experience. If the financial condition of a material portion of our independent retailers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific carrier’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record a specific allowances for intercarrier compensation against amounts due, to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. Total allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable as of December 31, 2006 was approximately 7% of the total amount of gross accounts receivable. 56 Table of Contents Inventories We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value or replacement cost based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Total inventory reserves for obsolescent and unmarketable inventory were not significant as of December 31, 2006. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Deferred Income Tax Asset and Other Tax Reserves We assess our deferred tax asset and record a valuation allowance, when necessary, to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future taxable income, taxable temporary differences and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period we made that determination. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax returns are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and ultimately modified. We adjust the reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of income tax related reserve positions and changes to income tax reserves that we consider appropriate. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is finally resolved. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash or a reduction in our net operating loss carryforwards. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the effective rate in the year of resolution. Tax reserves as of December 31, 2006 were $23.9 million of which $4.4 million and $19.5 million are presented on the consolidated balance sheet in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. Property and Equipment Depreciation on property and equipment is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service, which are ten years for network infrastructure assets including capitalized interest, three to seven years for office equipment, which includes computer equipment, three to seven years for furniture and fixtures and five years for vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease and any renewal periods reasonably assured or the estimated useful life of the improvement. The estimated life of property and equipment is based on historical experience with similar assets, as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. If technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation expense in future periods. Likewise, if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than anticipated, the life of the assets could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to property and equipment. This could result in a reduction of depreciation expense in future periods. We assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or in the strategy for our overall business. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. When we determine that the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, we measure any impairment based upon a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate we determine to be commensurate with the risk involved and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge associated with long-lived assets. The carrying value of property and equipment was approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2006. FCC Licenses and Microwave Relocation Costs We operate broadband PCS networks under licenses granted by the FCC for a particular geographic area on spectrum allocated by the FCC for broadband PCS services. In addition, in November 2006, we acquired a number 57 Table of Contents of AWS licenses which can be used to provide services comparable to the PCS services provided by us, and other advanced wireless services. The PCS licenses included the obligation to relocate existing fixed microwave users of our licensed spectrum if our spectrum interfered with their systems and/or reimburse other carriers (according to FCC rules) that relocated prior users if the relocation benefits our system. Additionally, we incurred costs related to microwave relocation in constructing our PCS network. The PCS and AWS licenses and microwave relocation costs are recorded at cost. Although FCC licenses are issued with a stated term, ten years in the case of PCS licenses and fifteen years in the case of AWS licenses, the renewal of PCS and AWS licenses is generally a routine matter without substantial cost and we have determined that no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors currently exist that limit the useful life of our PCS and AWS licenses. The carrying value of FCC licenses and microwave relocation costs was approximately $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2006. Our primary indefinite-lived intangible assets are our FCC licenses. Based on the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and other Intangible Assets,” (“SFAS No. 142”) we test investments in our FCC licenses for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our FCC licenses might be impaired. We perform our annual FCC license impairment test as of each September 30th. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value with the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our FCC licenses using a discounted cash flow model. Cash flow projections and assumptions, although subject to a degree of uncertainty, are based on a combination of our historical performance and trends, our business plans and management’s estimate of future performance, giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive economic conditions. Other assumptions include our weighted average cost of capital and long-term rate of growth for our business. We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use to estimate fair value. We corroborate our determination of fair value of the FCC licenses, using the discounted cash flow approach described above, with other market-based valuation metrics. Furthermore, we segregate our FCC licenses by regional clusters for the purpose of performing the impairment test because each geographical region is unique. An impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related indefinite-lived intangible asset and charged to results of operations. Historically, we have not experienced significant negative variations between our assumptions and estimates when compared to actual results. However, if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be required to record to an impairment charge associated with indefinite-lived intangible assets. Although we do not expect our estimates or assumptions to change significantly in the future, the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our FCC licenses or using a methodology other than a discounted cash flow model could result in different values for our FCC licenses and may affect any related impairment charge. The most significant assumptions within our discounted cash flow model are the discount rate, our projected growth rate and management’s future business plans. A change in management’s future business plans or disposition of one or more FCC licenses could result in the requirement to test certain other FCC licenses. If any legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors were to limit the useful lives of our indefinite-lived FCC licenses, we would be required to test these intangible assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142 and amortize the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. For the license impairment test performed as of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the FCC licenses was in excess of its carrying value. A 10% change in the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses would not have impacted the results of our annual license impairment test. Share-Based Payments We account for share-based awards exchanged for employee services in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”). Under SFAS No. 123(R), share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. Prior to 2006, we recognized stock-based compensation expense for employee share-based awards based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant pursuant to Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” (“APB No. 25”) and followed the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure,” (“SFAS No. 148”), which amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” (“SFAS No. 123”). We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. Under the modified prospective transition method, prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of 58 Table of Contents SFAS No. 123(R) apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or cancelled. Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, for awards outstanding at the effective date is recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated under SFAS No. 123 in prior periods. We have granted nonqualified stock options. Most of our stock option awards include a service condition that relates only to vesting. The stock option awards generally vest in one to four years from the grant date. Compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award. The determination of the fair value of stock options using an option-pricing model is affected by our common stock valuation as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. The methods used to determine these variables are generally similar to the methods used prior to 2006 for purposes of our pro forma information under SFAS No. 148. Factors that our Board of Directors considers in determining the fair market value of our common stock, include the recommendation of our finance and planning committee and of management based on certain data, including discounted cash flow analysis, comparable company analysis and comparable transaction analysis, as well as contemporaneous valuation reports. The volatility assumption is based on a combination of the historical volatility of our common stock and the volatilities of similar companies over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock options. The volatilities of similar companies are used in conjunction with our historical volatility because of the lack of sufficient relevant history equal to the expected term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. The expected term assumption is estimated based primarily on the stock options’ vesting terms and remaining contractual life and employees’ expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on the grant date appropriate for the term of the employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the expectation of no future dividend payouts by us. As share-based compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R) is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it is reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The value of the options is determined by using a Black-Scholes pricing model that includes the following variables: 1) exercise price of the instrument, 2) fair market value of the underlying stock on date of grant, 3) expected life, 4) estimated volatility and 5) the risk-free interest rate. The Company utilized the following weighted-average assumptions in estimating the fair value of the options grants for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: December 31, December 31, 2006 2005 Expected dividends 0.00 % 0.00 % Expected volatility 35.04 % 50.00 % Risk-free interest rate 4.64 % 4.24 % Expected lives in years 5.00 5.00 Weighted-average fair value of options: Granted at below fair value $ 10.16 $ — Granted at fair value $ 3.75 $ 3.44 Weighted-average exercise price of options: Granted at below fair value $ 1.49 $ — Granted at fair value $ 9.95 $ 7.13 The Black-Scholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions including expectations of future dividends and stock price volatility. Such assumptions are only used for making the required fair value estimate and should not be considered as indicators of future dividend policy or stock price appreciation. Because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, and because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, the use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model may not provide a reliable estimate of the fair value of employee stock options. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, the following awards were granted under the Company’s Option Plans: 59 Table of Contents Weighted Weighted Weighted Number of Average Average Average Grants Made During Options Exercise Market Value Intrinsic Value the Quarter Ended Granted Price per Share per Share March 31, 2005 60,000 $ 6.31 $ 6.31 $ 0.00 June 30, 2005 — — — — September 30, 2005 4,922,385 $ 7.14 $ 7.14 $ 0.00 December 31, 2005 856,149 $ 7.15 $ 7.15 $ 0.00 March 31, 2006 2,869,989 $ 7.15 $ 7.15 $ 0.00 June 30, 2006 534,525 $ 7.54 $ 7.54 $ 0.00 September 30, 2006 418,425 $ 8.67 $ 8.67 $ 0.00 December 31, 2006 7,546,854 $ 10.81 $ 11.33 $ 0.53 Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award. Valuation of Common Stock Significant Factors, Assumptions, and Methodologies Used in Determining the Fair Value of our Common Stock. The determination of the fair value of our common stock requires us to make judgments that are complex and inherently subjective. Factors that our Board of Directors considers in determining the fair market value of our common stock include the recommendation of our finance and planning committee and of management based on certain data, including discounted cash flow analysis, comparable company analysis and comparable transaction analysis, as well as contemporaneous valuation reports. When determining the fair value of our common stock, we follow the guidance prescribed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in its practice aid, “Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation,” (the “Practice Aid”). According to the Practice Aid, quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value of a security and should be used as the basis for the measurement of fair value, if available. Since quoted market prices for our securities are not available, the estimate of fair value should be based on the best information available, including prices for similar securities and the results of using other valuation techniques. Privately held enterprises or shareholders sometimes engage in arm’s-length cash transactions with unrelated parties for the issuance or sale of their equity securities, and the cash exchanged in such a transaction is, under certain conditions, an observable price that serves the same purpose as a quoted market price. Those conditions are (a) the equity securities in the transaction are the same securities as those with the fair value determination is being made, and (b) the transaction is a current transaction between willing parties. To the extent that arm’s-length cash transactions were available, we utilized those transactions to determine the fair value of our common stock. When arm’s-length transactions as described above were not available, then we utilized other valuation techniques based on a number of methodologies and analyses, including: • discounted cash flow analysis; • comparable company market multiples; and • comparable merger and acquisition transaction multiples. Sales of our common stock in arm’s-length cash transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 were as follows: Number of Price Gross Shares per Share Proceeds October 2005 48,847,533 $ 7.15 $ 349,422,686 September 2006 1,375,488 $ 8.67 11,920,896 October 2006 1,654,050 $ 8.67 14,335,100 Total 51,877,071 $ 375,678,682 Customer Recognition and Disconnect Policies When a new customer subscribes to our service, the first month of service and activation fee is included with the handset purchase. Under GAAP, we are required to allocate the purchase price to the handset and to the 60 Table of Contents wireless service revenue. Generally, the amount allocated to the handset will be less than our cost, and this difference is included in Cost Per Gross Addition, or CPGA. We recognize new customers as gross customer additions upon activation of service. Prior to January 23, 2006, we offered our customers the Metro Promise, which allowed a customer to return a newly purchased handset for a full refund prior to the earlier of 7 days or 60 minutes of use. Beginning on January 23, 2006, we expanded the terms of the Metro Promise to allow a customer to return a newly purchased handset for a full refund prior to the earlier of 30 days or 60 minutes of use. Customers who return their phones under the Metro Promise are reflected as a reduction to gross customer additions. Customers’ monthly service payments are due in advance every month. Our customers must pay their monthly service amount by the payment date or their service will be suspended, or hotlined, and the customer will not be able to make or receive calls on our network. However, a hotlined customer is still able to make E-911 calls in the event of an emergency. There is no service grace period. Any call attempted by a hotlined customer is routed directly to our interactive voice response system and customer service center in order to arrange payment. If the customer pays the amount due within 30 days of the original payment date then the customer’s service is restored. If a hotlined customer does not pay the amount due within 30 days of the payment date the account is disconnected and counted as churn. Once an account is disconnected we charge a $15 reconnect fee upon reactivation to reestablish service and the revenue associated with this fee is deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the customer. Revenues We derive our revenues from the following sources: Service. We sell wireless broadband PCS services. The various types of service revenues associated with wireless broadband PCS for our customers include monthly recurring charges for airtime, monthly recurring charges for optional features (including nationwide long distance and text messaging, ringtones, games and content applications, unlimited directory assistance, ring back tones, mobile Internet browsing, push e-mail and nationwide roaming) and charges for long distance service. Service revenues also include intercarrier compensation and nonrecurring activation service charges to customers. Equipment. We sell wireless broadband PCS handsets and accessories that are used by our customers in connection with our wireless services. This equipment is also sold to our independent retailers to facilitate distribution to our customers. Costs and Expenses Our costs and expenses include: Cost of Service. The major components of our cost of service are: • Cell Site Costs. We incur expenses for the rent of cell sites, network facilities, engineering operations, field technicians and related utility and maintenance charges. • Intercarrier Compensation. We pay charges to other telecommunications companies for their transport and termination of calls originated by our customers and destined for customers of other networks. These variable charges are based on our customers’ usage and generally applied at pre-negotiated rates with other carriers, although some carriers have sought to impose such charges unilaterally. • Variable Long Distance. We pay charges to other telecommunications companies for long distance service provided to our customers. These variable charges are based on our customers’ usage, applied at pre-negotiated rates with the long distance carriers. Cost of Equipment. We purchase wireless broadband PCS handsets and accessories from third-party vendors to resell to our customers and independent retailers in connection with our services. We subsidize the sale of handsets to encourage the sale and use of our services. We do not manufacture any of this equipment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling expense includes advertising and promotional costs associated with marketing and selling to new customers and fixed charges such as retail store rent and retail associates’ salaries. General and administrative expense includes support functions including, technical operations, finance, accounting, human resources, information technology and legal services. We record stock-based 61 Table of Contents compensation expense in cost of service and selling, general and administrative expenses associated with employee stock options which is measured at the date of grant, based on the estimated fair value of the award. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we recorded stock-based compensation expense at the end of each reporting period with respect to our variable stock options. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service, which are ten years for network infrastructure assets and capitalized interest, three to seven years for office equipment, which includes computer equipment, three to seven years for furniture and fixtures and five years for vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the respective leases, which includes renewal periods that are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense includes interest incurred on our borrowings, amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of discounts and premiums on long-term debt. Interest income is earned primarily on our cash and cash equivalents. Income Taxes. As a result of our operating losses and accelerated depreciation available under federal tax laws, we paid no federal income taxes prior to 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we paid approximately $2.7 million in federal income taxes. In addition, we have paid an immaterial amount of state income tax through December 31, 2006. Seasonality Our customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. Based on historical results, we generally expect net customer additions to be strongest in the first and fourth quarters. Softening of sales and increased customer turnover, or churn, in the second and third quarters of the year usually combine to result in fewer net customer additions. However, sales activity and churn can be strongly affected by the launch of new markets and promotional activity, which have the ability to reduce or outweigh certain seasonal effects. Operating Segments Operating segments are defined by SFAS No. 131 “Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” (“SFAS No. 131”), as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. As of December 31, 2006, we had eight operating segments based on geographic region within the United States: Atlanta, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Miami, San Francisco, Sacramento, Tampa/Sarasota/Orlando and Los Angeles. Each of these operating segments provide wireless voice and data services and products to customers in its service areas or is currently constructing a network in order to provide these services. These services include unlimited local and long distance calling, voicemail, caller ID, call waiting, text messaging, picture and multimedia messaging, international long distance and text messaging, ringtones, games and content applications, unlimited directory assistance, ring back tones, nationwide roaming, mobile Internet browsing, push e-mail and other value-added services. We aggregate our operating segments into two reportable segments: Core Markets and Expansion Markets. • Core Markets, which include Atlanta, Miami, San Francisco, and Sacramento, are aggregated because they are reviewed on an aggregate basis by the chief operating decision maker, they are similar in respect to their products and services, production processes, class of customer, method of distribution, and regulatory environment and currently exhibit similar financial performance and economic characteristics. • Expansion Markets, which include Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Tampa/Sarasota/Orlando and Los Angeles, are aggregated because they are reviewed on an aggregate basis by the chief operating decision maker, they are similar in respect to their products and services, production 62 Table of Contents processes, class of customer, method of distribution, and regulatory environment and have similar expected long-term financial performance and economic characteristics. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

Consolidated Data 2006 2005 Change (In thousands) Loss (gain) on disposal of assets $ 8,806 $ (218,203 ) 104 % Loss on extinguishment of debt 51,518 46,448 11 % Interest expense 115,985 58,033 100 % Provision for income taxes 36,717 127,425 (72 )% Net income 53,806 198,677 (73 )% Loss (Gain) on Disposal of Assets. In May 2005, we completed the sale of a 10 MHz portion of our 30 MHz PCS license in the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose basic trading area for cash consideration of $230.0 million. The sale of PCS spectrum resulted in a gain on disposal of asset in the amount of $228.2 million. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. In November 2006, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our first and second lien credit agreements and the exchangeable secured and unsecured bridge credit agreements. As a result, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of approximately $42.7 million of the first and second lien credit agreements and an approximately $9.4 million loss on the extinguishment of the exchangeable secured and unsecured bridge credit agreements. In May 2005, we repaid all of the outstanding debt under our FCC notes, 103/4% senior notes and bridge credit agreement. As a result, we recorded a $1.9 million loss on the extinguishment of the FCC notes; a $34.0 million loss on extinguishment of the 103/4% senior notes; and a $10.4 million loss on the extinguishment of the bridge credit agreement. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $58.0 million, or 100%, to $116.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased average principal balance outstanding as a result of additional borrowings of $150.0 million under our first and second lien credit agreements in the fourth quarter of 2005, $200.0 million under the secured bridge credit facility in the third quarter of 2006 and an additional $1,300.0 million under the secured and unsecured bridge credit facilities in the fourth quarter of 2006. Interest expense also increased due to the 67 Table of Contents weighted average interest rate increasing to 10.30% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 8.92% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by the capitalization of $17.5 million of interest during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $3.6 million of interest capitalized during the same period in 2005. We capitalize interest costs associated with our FCC licenses and property and equipment beginning with pre-construction period administrative and technical activities, which includes obtaining leases, zoning approvals and building permits. The amount of such capitalized interest depends on the carrying values of the FCC licenses and construction in progress involved in those markets and the duration of the construction process. With respect to our FCC licenses, capitalization of interest costs ceases at the point in time in which the asset is ready for its intended use, which generally coincides with the market launch date. In the case of our property and equipment, capitalization of interest costs ceases at the point in time in which the network assets are placed into service. We expect capitalized interest to be significant during the construction of our additional Expansion Markets and related network assets. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased to $36.7 million, which is approximately 41% of our income before provision for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2005 the provision for income taxes was $127.4 million, or approximately 39% of income before provision for income taxes. The year ended December 31, 2005 included a gain on the sale of a 10 MHz portion of our 30 MHz PCS license in the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose basic trading area in the amount of $228.2 million. Net Income. Net income decreased $144.9 million, or 73%, to $53.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $198.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The significant decrease is primarily attributable to our non-recurring sale of a 10 MHz portion of our 30 MHz PCS license in the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose basic trading area in May 2005 for cash consideration of $230.0 million. The sale of PCS spectrum resulted in a gain on disposal of asset in the amount of $139.2 million, net of income taxes. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, excluding the tax effected impact of the gain on the sale of the PCS license, decreased approximately 10%. The decrease in net income, excluding the tax effected impact of the gain on the sale of spectrum, is primarily due to the increase in operating losses in our Expansion Markets. This increase in operating losses in our Expansion Markets is attributable to the launch of the Dallas/Ft. Worth metropolitan area in March 2006, the Detroit metropolitan area in April 2006, and the expansion of the Tampa/Sarasota area to include the Orlando metropolitan area in November 2006 as well as build-out expenses related to the Los Angeles metropolitan area. We have obtained positive operating income in our Core Markets at or before five full quarters of operations. Based on our experience to date in our Expansion Markets and current industry trends, we expect our Expansion Markets to achieve positive operating income in a period similar to or better than the Core Markets. 68 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Set forth below is a summary of certain financial information by reportable operating segment for the periods indicated.

Expansion Markets selling, general and administrative expenses were $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Selling expenses were $3.5 million and general and administrative expenses were $5.7 million for 2005. These expenses are comprised of marketing and advertising expenses as well as labor, rent, professional fees and various administrative expenses associated with the launch of the Tampa/Sarasota metropolitan area in October 2005 and build-out of the Dallas/Ft. Worth and Detroit metropolitan areas. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $25.7 million, or 41%, to $87.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase is primarily due to increases in Core Markets and Expansion Markets depreciation expense as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets depreciation and amortization expense increased $23.1 million, or 38%, to $84.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $61.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase related primarily to an increase in network infrastructure assets placed into service during 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. We added 315 cell sites in our Core Markets during the year ended December 31, 2005 to increase the capacity of our existing network and expand our footprint. • Expansion Markets. Expansion Markets depreciation and amortization expense was $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This expense is attributable to network infrastructure assets placed into service as a result of the launch of the Tampa/Sarasota metropolitan area. Consolidated Data 2005 2004 Change (In Thousands) Loss (gain) on disposal of assets $ (218,203 ) $ 3,209 ** (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt 46,448 (698 ) ** Interest expense 58,033 19,030 205 % Provision for income taxes 127,425 47,000 171 % Net income 198,677 64,890 206 % ** Not meaningful Loss (Gain) on Disposal of Assets. In May 2005, we completed the sale of a 10 MHz portion of our 30 MHz PCS license in the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose basic trading area for cash consideration of $230.0 million. The sale of PCS spectrum resulted in a gain on disposal of asset in the amount of $228.2 million. (Gain) Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. In May 2005, we repaid all of the outstanding debt under our FCC notes, Senior Notes and bridge credit agreement. As a result, we recorded a $1.9 million loss on the extinguishment 71 Table of Contents of the FCC notes; a $34.0 million loss on extinguishment of the Senior Notes; and a $10.4 million loss on the extinguishment of the bridge credit agreement. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $39.0 million, or 205%, to $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to $40.9 million in interest expense related to our Credit Agreements that were executed on May 31, 2005 as well as the amortization of the deferred debt issuance costs in the amount of $3.6 million associated with the Credit Agreements. On May 31, 2005, we paid all of our outstanding obligations under our FCC notes and Senior Notes, which generally had lower interest rates than our Credit Agreements. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for year ended December 31, 2005 increased to $127.4 million, which is approximately 39% of our income before provision for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2004 the provision for income taxes was $47.0 million, or approximately 42% of income before provision for income taxes. The increase in our income tax expense in 2005 was attributable to our increased operating profits. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 relates primarily to the increase in book income which lowers the effective rate of tax items included in the calculation. Net Income. Net income increased $133.8 million, or 206%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The significant increase in net income is primarily attributable to our nonrecurring sale of a 10 MHz portion of our 30 MHz PCS license in the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose basic trading area in May 2005 for cash consideration of $230.0 million. The sale of PCS spectrum resulted in a gain on disposal of asset in the amount of $139.2 million, net of income taxes. In addition, growth in average customers of approximately 37% during 2005 also contributed to the increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2005. These increases were partially offset by a $46.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the consolidated summary information presented below represents Core Markets reportable segment information, as the Expansion Markets reportable segment had no operations until 2005. Set forth below is a summary of certain financial information for the periods indicated: 2004 2003 Change (In Thousands) Revenues Service revenues $ 616,401 $ 369,851 67 % Equipment revenues 131,849 81,258 62 % Cost of service (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below) 200,806 122,211 64 % Cost of equipment 222,766 150,832 48 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below) 131,510 94,073 40 % Depreciation and amortization 62,201 42,428 47 % Interest expense 19,030 11,115 71 % Provision for income taxes 47,000 16,179 191 % Net income 64,890 15,358 323 % Service Revenues. Service revenues increased $246.5 million, or 67%, to $616.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $369.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase is primarily attributable to the addition of approximately 422,000 customers accounting for $159.7 million of the increase, coupled with the migration of existing customers to higher priced rate plans accounting for $86.8 million of the increase. The increase in customers migrating to higher priced rate plans is primarily the result of our emphasis on offering additional services under our $45 rate plan, which includes unlimited nationwide long distance and various unlimited data features. In addition, this migration is expected to continue as our higher priced rate plans become more attractive to our existing customer base. 72 Table of Contents Equipment Revenues. Equipment revenues increased $50.6 million, or 62%, to $131.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase is attributable to higher priced handset models accounting for $28.7 million of the increase; coupled with the increase in gross customer additions during the year of approximately 240,000 customers accounting for $21.9 million of the increase. The increase in handset model availability is primarily the result of our emphasis on enhancing our product offerings and appealing to our customer base in connection with our wireless services. Cost of Service. Cost of service increased $78.6 million, or 64%, to $200.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $122.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was attributable to the addition of approximately 422,000 customers during the year. Additionally, employee costs, cell site and switch facility lease expense and repair and maintenance expense increased as a result of the growth of our business and the expansion of our network. Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment increased $71.9 million, or 48%, to $222.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $150.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in cost of equipment was due to a slight increase in the average handset cost per unit which related to an increase in sales of higher priced handset models in 2004. In addition, we experienced an increase in the number of handsets sold to new customers during the year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $37.4 million, or 40%, to $131.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $94.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Selling, general and administrative expenses include stock-based compensation expense, which increased $4.8 million, or 87%, to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily related to the extension of the exercise period of stock options for a terminated employee in the amount of approximately $3.6 million. The remaining increase was a result of an increase in the estimated fair market value of our stock used for valuing stock options accounted for under variable accounting. Selling expenses increased by $8.6 million as a result of increased sales and marketing activities. General and administrative expenses increased by $25.6 million primarily due to the increase in our administrative costs associated with our customer base and to network expansion, a $8.1 million increase in professional fees including legal and accounting services, a $3.7 million increase in employee salaries and benefits, a $3.6 million increase in bank service charges, a $0.5 million increase in rent expense, a $1.2 million increase in personal property tax expense, and a $1.1 million increase in property insurance. Of the $8.1 million increase in professional fees, approximately $3.2 million was related to the preparation of a registration statement for an initial public offering of our common stock to the public. These costs were expensed, as this initial public offering was not completed and the registration statement was withdrawn. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $19.8 million, or 47%, to $62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $42.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase related primarily to an increase in network infrastructure assets placed into service in 2004. In-service base stations and switching equipment increased by approximately $237.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2004. In addition, we had 460 more cell sites in service at December 31, 2004 than at December 31, 2003. We expect depreciation to continue to increase due to the additional cell sites, switches and other network equipment that we plan to place in service to meet future customer growth and usage. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $7.9 million, or 71%, to $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to interest expense on our $150.0 million Senior Notes that were issued in September 2003. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for year ended December 31, 2004 increased to $47.0 million, which is approximately 42% of our income before provision for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2003 the provision for income taxes was $16.2 million, or approximately 51% of income before provision for income taxes. The increase in our income tax expense in 2004 was attributable to our increased operating profits. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2003 to 2004 relates primarily to the increase in book income which lowers the effective rate of tax items included in the calculation. In addition, the 2003 income tax provision includes a charge required under California law to partially reduce the 2003 California net operating loss carryforwards. However, this statutory requirement did not exist in 2004. 73 Table of Contents Net Income. Net income increased $49.5 million, or 323%, for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in net income is primarily attributable to growth in average customers of approximately 56% for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 in addition to the migration of existing customers to higher priced rate plans. Quarterly Results of Operations The following tables present our unaudited condensed consolidated quarterly statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006. We derived our quarterly results of operations data from our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

These metrics include average revenue per user per month, or ARPU, which measures service revenue per customer; cost per gross customer addition, or CPGA, which measures the average cost of acquiring a new customer; cost per user per month, or CPU, which measures the non-selling cash cost of operating our business on a per customer basis; and churn, which measures turnover in our customer base. For a reconciliation of Non-GAAP performance measures and a further discussion of the measures, please read “— Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. The following table shows annual metric information for 2004, 2005 and 2006. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 Customers: End of period 1,398,732 1,924,621 2,940,986 Net additions 421,833 525,889 1,016,365 Churn: Average monthly rate 4.9 % 5.1 % 4.6 % ARPU $ 41.13 $ 42.40 $ 42.98 CPGA $ 103.78 $ 102.70 $ 117.58 CPU $ 18.95 $ 19.57 $ 19.65 Customers. Net customer additions were 1,016,365 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 525,889 for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 93%. Total customers were 2,940,986 as of December 31, 2006, an increase of 53% over the customer total as of December 31, 2005. Total customers as of December 31, 2005 were approximately 1.9 million, an increase of 38% over the total customers as of December 31, 2004. These increases are primarily attributable to the continued demand for our service offering. Churn. As we do not require a long-term service contract, our churn percentage is expected to be higher than traditional wireless carriers that require customers to sign a one- to two-year contract with significant early termination fees. Average monthly churn represents (a) the number of customers who have been disconnected from our system during the measurement period less the number of customers who have reactivated service, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. We classify delinquent customers as churn after they have been delinquent for 30 days. In addition, when an existing customer establishes a new account in connection with the purchase of an upgraded or replacement phone and does not identify themselves as an existing customer, we count that phone leaving service as a churn and the new phone entering service as a gross customer addition. Churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 4.6% compared to 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Based upon a change in the allowable return period from 7 days to 30 days, we revised our definition of gross customer additions to exclude customers that discontinue service in the first 30 days of service. This revision reduces deactivations and gross customer additions commencing March 23, 2006, and reduces churn. Churn computed under the original 7 day allowable return period would have been 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Our average monthly rate of customer turnover, or churn, was 5.1% and 4.9% for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Average monthly churn rates for selected traditional wireless carriers ranges from 1.0% to 2.6% for post-pay customers and over 6.0% for pre-pay customers based on public filings or press releases. Average Revenue Per User. ARPU represents (a) service revenues less activation revenues, E-911, FUSF, and vendor’s compensation charges for the measurement period, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. ARPU was $42.98 and $42.40 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, an increase of $0.58, or 1.4%. ARPU increased $1.27, or approximately 3.1%, during 2005 from $41.13 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in ARPU was primarily the result of attracting customers to higher priced service plans, which include unlimited nationwide long distance for $40 per month as well as unlimited nationwide long distance and certain calling and data features on an unlimited basis for $45 per month. Cost Per Gross Addition. CPGA is determined by dividing (a) selling expenses plus the total cost of equipment associated with transactions with new customers less activation revenues and equipment revenues associated with transactions with new customers during the measurement period by (b) gross customer additions 75 Table of Contents during such period. Retail customer service expenses and equipment margin on handsets sold to existing customers when they are identified, including handset upgrade transactions, are excluded, as these costs are incurred specifically for existing customers. CPGA costs have increased to $117.58 for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $102.70 for the year ended December 31, 2005, which was primarily driven by the selling expenses associated with the launch of the Dallas/Ft. Worth metropolitan area, the Detroit metropolitan area and the expansion of the Tampa/Sarasota area to include the Orlando metropolitan area. In addition, on January 23, 2006, we revised the terms of our return policy from 7 days to 30 days, and as a result we revised our definition of gross customer additions to exclude customers that discontinue service in the first 30 days of service. This revision, commencing March 23, 2006, reduces deactivations and gross customer additions and increases CPGA. CPGA decreased $1.08, or 1.0%, in 2005 from $103.78 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in CPGA was the result of the higher rate of growth in customer activations and the relatively fixed nature of the expenses associated with those activations. Cost Per User. CPU is cost of service and general and administrative costs (excluding applicable non-cash stock-based compensation expense included in cost of service and general and administrative expense) plus net loss on handset equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition (which includes the gain or loss on sale of handsets to existing customers and costs associated with handset replacements and repairs (other than warranty costs which are the responsibility of the handset manufacturers)), divided by sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. CPU for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $19.65 and $19.57, respectively. CPU for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $18.95. We continue to achieve cost benefits due to the increasing scale of our business. However, these benefits have been offset by a combination of the construction and launch expenses associated with our Expansion Markets, which contributed approximately $3.42 of additional CPU for the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, CPU has increased historically due to costs associated with higher ARPU service plans such as those related to unlimited nationwide long distance. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, CPU was impacted by substantial legal and accounting expenses in the amount of approximately $1.5 million and $5.9 million, respectively, associated with an internal investigation related to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as well as financial statement audits related to our restatement efforts. The following table shows quarterly metric information for the year ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006. Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, 2005 2005 2005 2005 2006 2006 2006 2006 Customers: End of period 1,567,969 1,645,174 1,739,787 1,924,621 2,170,059 2,418,909 2,616,532 2,940,986 Net additions 169,236 77,205 94,613 184,834 245,437 248,850 197,623 324,454 Churn(1): Average monthly rate 4.3 % 5.1 % 5.6 % 5.2 % 4.4 % 4.5 % 5.0 % 4.5 % ARPU $ 42.57 $ 42.32 $ 42.16 $ 42.55 $ 43.12 $ 42.86 $ 42.78 $ 43.15 CPGA(1) $ 100.15 $ 101.63 $ 102.56 $ 105.50 $ 106.26 $ 122.20 $ 120.29 $ 120.01 CPU $ 19.33 $ 18.50 $ 19.61 $ 20.67 $ 20.11 $ 19.78 $ 19.15 $ 19.67 (1) On January 23, 2006, we revised the terms of our return policy from 7 days to 30 days, and as a result we revised our definition of gross customer additions to exclude customers that discontinue service in the first 30 days of service. This revision, commencing March 23, 2006, reduces deactivations and gross customer additions, which reduces churn and increases CPGA. Churn computed under the original 7 day allowable return period would have been 4.5%, 5.2%, 5.7% and 5.0% for the three month periods ended March 31, 2006, June 30, 2006, September 30, 2006 and December 31, 2006, respectively. CPGA computed under the original 7 day allowable return period would have been $105.33, $113.11, $110.43 and $113.67 for the three month periods ended March 31, 2006, June 30, 2006, September 30, 2006 and December 31, 2006, respectively. 76 Table of Contents Core Markets Performance Measures Set forth below is a summary of certain key performance measures for the periods indicated for our Core Markets: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Core Markets Customers: End of period 1,398,732 1,871,665 2,300,958 Net additions 421,833 472,933 429,293 Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA $ 203,597 $ 316,555 $ 492,773 Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA as a Percent of Service Revenues 33.0 % 36.4 % 43.3 % We launched our service initially in 2002 in the greater Miami, Atlanta, Sacramento and San Francisco metropolitan areas. Our Core Markets have a licensed population of approximately 26 million, of which our networks currently cover approximately 22 million. In addition, we had positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain/loss on disposal of assets, accretion of put option in majority-owned subsidiary, gain/loss on extinguishment of debt, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and non-cash stock-based compensation, or Adjusted EBITDA, in our Core Markets after only four full quarters of operations. Customers. Net customer additions in our Core Markets were 429,293 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 472,933 for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total customers were 2,300,958 as of December 31, 2006, an increase of 23% over the customer total as of December 31, 2005. Net customer additions in our Core Markets were 472,933 for the year ended December 31, 2005, bringing our total customers to approximately 1.9 million as of December 31, 2005, an increase of 34% over the total customers as of December 31, 2004. These increases are primarily attributable to the continued demand for our service offering. Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is presented in accordance with SFAS No. 131 as it is the primary performance metric for which our reportable segments are evaluated and it is utilized by management to facilitate evaluation of our ability to meet future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to fund future growth. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA was $492.8 million compared to $316.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA was $203.6 million. We continue to experience increases in Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA as a result of continued customer growth and cost benefits due to the increasing scale of our business in the Core Markets. Adjusted EBITDA as a Percent of Service Revenues. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of service revenues is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total service revenues. Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was 43% and 36%, respectively. Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 33%. Consistent with the increase in Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA, we continue to experience corresponding increases in Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of service revenues due to the growth in service revenues as well as cost benefits due to the increasing scale of our business in the Core Markets. The following table shows a summary of certain quarterly key performance measures for the periods indicated for our Core Markets. Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, 2005 2005 2005 2005 2006 2006 2006 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Core Markets Customers: End of period 1,567,969 1,645,174 1,739,441 1,871,665 2,055,550 2,119,168 2,174,264 2,300,958 Net additions 169,236 77,205 94,267 132,224 183,884 63,618 55,096 126,694 Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA $ 68,036 $ 84,321 $ 81,133 $ 83,064 $ 109,120 $ 127,182 $ 128,283 $ 128,188 Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA as a Percent of Service Revenues 34.6 % 39.6 % 36.6 % 35.0 % 41.2 % 45.2 % 45.0 % 41.8 % 77 Table of Contents Expansion Markets Performance Measures Set forth below is a summary of certain key performance measures for the periods indicated for our Expansion Markets: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Expansion Markets Customers: End of period — 52,956 640,028 Net additions — 52,956 587,072 Expansion Markets Adjusted EBITDA (Deficit) — $ (22,090 ) $ (97,214 ) Customers. Net customer additions in our Expansion Markets were 587,072 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total customers were 640,028 as of December 31, 2006 compared to 52,956 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in customers was primarily attributable to the launch of the Dallas/Ft. Worth metropolitan area in March 2006, the Detroit metropolitan area in April 2006 and the expansion of the Tampa/Sarasota area to include the Orlando metropolitan area in November 2006. Net customer additions in our Expansion Markets were 52,956 for the year ended December 31, 2005, which was attributable to the launch of the Tampa/Sarasota metropolitan area in October 2005. Adjusted EBITDA (Deficit). Adjusted EBITDA is presented in accordance with SFAS No. 131 as it is the primary performance metric for which our reportable segments are evaluated and it is utilized by management to facilitate evaluation of our ability to meet future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to fund future growth. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Expansion Markets Adjusted EBITDA deficit was $97.2 million compared to $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increases in Adjusted EBITDA deficit, when compared to the same periods in the previous year, were attributable to the launch of the Tampa/Sarasota metropolitan area in October 2005, the Dallas/Ft. Worth metropolitan area in March 2006, the Detroit metropolitan area in April 2006 and the expansion of the Tampa/Sarasota area to include the Orlando metropolitan area in November 2006 as well as expenses associated with the construction of the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows; or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented. Average revenue per user, or ARPU, cost per gross addition, or CPGA, and cost per user, or CPU, are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to judge our ability to meet our liquidity requirements and to evaluate our operating performance. We believe these measures are important in understanding the performance of our operations from period to period, and although every company in the wireless industry does not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures (which are common in the wireless industry) facilitate key liquidity and operating performance comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry. The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures with our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. 78 Table of Contents ARPU — We utilize average revenue per user, or ARPU, to evaluate our per-customer service revenue realization and to assist in forecasting our future service revenues. ARPU is calculated exclusive of activation revenues, as these amounts are a component of our costs of acquiring new customers and are included in our calculation of CPGA. ARPU is also calculated exclusive of E-911, FUSF and vendor’s compensation charges, as these are generally pass through charges that we collect from our customers and remit to the appropriate government agencies. Average number of customers for any measurement period is determined by dividing (a) the sum of the average monthly number of customers for the measurement period by (b) the number of months in such period. Average monthly number of customers for any month represents the sum of the number of customers on the first day of the month and the last day of the month divided by two. The following table shows the calculation of ARPU for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In thousands, except average number of customers and ARPU) Calculation of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Service revenues $ 616,401 $ 872,100 $ 1,290,947 Less: Activation revenues (7,874 ) (6,808 ) (8,297 ) E-911, FUSF and vendor’s compensation charges (12,522 ) (26,221 ) (45,640 ) Net service revenues $ 596,005 $ 839,071 $ 1,237,010 Divided by: Average number of customers 1,207,521 1,649,208 2,398,682 ARPU $ 41.13 $ 42.40 $ 42.98 Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, 2005 2005 2005 2005 (In thousands, except average number of customers and ARPU) Calculation of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Service revenues $ 196,898 $ 212,697 $ 221,615 $ 240,891 Less: Activation revenues (1,581 ) (1,656 ) (1,751 ) (1,821 ) E-911, FUSF and vendor’s compensation charges (6,075 ) (6,286 ) (6,513 ) (7,346 ) Net service revenues $ 189,242 $ 204,755 $ 213,351 $ 231,724 Divided by: Average number of customers 1,481,839 1,612,932 1,686,774 1,815,288 ARPU $ 42.57 $ 42.32 $ 42.16 $ 42.55 Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, 2006 2006 2006 2006 (In thousands, except average number of customers and ARPU) Calculation of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Service revenues $ 275,416 $ 307,843 $ 332,920 $ 374,768 Less: Activation revenues (1,923 ) (1,979 ) (2,123 ) (2,272 ) E-911, FUSF and vendor’s compensation charges (8,958 ) (10,752 ) (9,512 ) (16,418 ) Net service revenues $ 264,535 $ 295,112 $ 321,285 $ 356,078 Divided by: Average number of customers 2,045,110 2,295,249 2,503,423 2,750,943 ARPU $ 43.12 $ 42.86 $ 42.78 $ 43.15 CPGA — We utilize cost per gross customer addition, or CPGA, to assess the efficiency of our distribution strategy, validate the initial capital invested in our customers and determine the number of months to recover our customer acquisition costs. This measure also allows us to compare our average acquisition costs per new customer to those of other wireless broadband PCS providers. Activation revenues and equipment revenues related to new customers are deducted from selling expenses in this calculation as they represent amounts paid by customers at the time their service is activated that reduce our acquisition cost of those customers. Additionally, equipment costs associated with existing customers, net of related revenues, are excluded as this measure is intended to reflect only the acquisition costs related to new customers. The following table reconciles total costs used in the calculation of CPGA to selling expenses, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to CPGA. 79 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In thousands, except gross customer additions and CPGA) Calculation of Cost Per Gross Addition (CPGA): Selling expenses $ 52,605 $ 62,396 $ 104,620 Less: Activation revenues (7,874 ) (6,808 ) (8,297 ) Less: Equipment revenues (131,849 ) (166,328 ) (255,916 ) Add: Equipment revenue not associated with new customers 54,323 77,010 114,392 Add: Cost of equipment 222,766 300,871 476,877 Less: Equipment costs not associated with new customers (72,200 ) (109,803 ) (155,930 ) Gross addition expenses $ 117,771 $ 157,338 $ 275,746 Divided by: Gross customer additions 1,134,762 1,532,071 2,345,135 CPGA $ 103.78 $ 102.70 $ 117.58 Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, 2005 2005 2005 2005 (In thousands, except gross customer additions and CPGA) Calculation of Cost Per Gross Addition (CPGA): Selling expenses $ 14,115 $ 14,482 $ 15,266 $ 18,533 Less: Activation revenues (1,581 ) (1,656 ) (1,751 ) (1,821 ) Less: Equipment revenues (39,058 ) (37,992 ) (41,940 ) (47,338 ) Add: Equipment revenue not associated with new customers 16,666 17,767 20,891 21,687 Add: Cost of equipment 68,101 65,287 77,140 90,342 Less: Equipment costs not associated with new customers (22,080 ) (24,881 ) (30,949 ) (31,893 ) Gross addition expenses $ 36,163 $ 33,007 $ 38,657 $ 49,510 Divided by: Gross customer additions 361,079 324,777 376,916 469,299 CPGA $ 100.15 $ 101.63 $ 102.56 $ 105.50 Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, 2006 2006 2006 2006 (In thousands, except gross customer additions and CPGA) Calculation of Cost Per Gross Addition (CPGA): Selling expenses $ 20,298 $ 26,437 $ 26,062 $ 31,823 Less: Activation revenues (1,923 ) (1,979 ) (2,123 ) (2,272 ) Less: Equipment revenues (54,045 ) (60,351 ) (63,196 ) (78,324 ) Add: Equipment revenue not associated with new customers 24,864 26,904 28,802 33,822 Add: Cost of equipment 100,911 112,005 117,982 145,979 Less: Equipment costs not associated with new customers (35,364 ) (34,669 ) (38,259 ) (47,638 ) Gross addition expenses $ 54,741 $ 68,347 $ 69,268 $ 83,390 Divided by: Gross customer additions 515,153 559,309 575,820 694,853 CPGA $ 106.26 $ 122.20 $ 120.29 $ 120.01 CPU — Cost per user, or CPU, is cost of service and general and administrative costs (excluding applicable non-cash stock-based compensation expense included in cost of service and general and administrative expense) plus net loss on equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition (which includes the gain or loss on sale of handsets to existing customers and costs associated with handset replacements and repairs (other than warranty costs which are the responsibility of the handset manufacturers)) exclusive of E-911, FUSF and vendor’s compensation charges, divided by the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. CPU does not include any depreciation and amortization expense. Management uses CPU as a tool to evaluate the non- 80 Table of Contents selling cash expenses associated with ongoing business operations on a per customer basis, to track changes in these non-selling cash costs over time, and to help evaluate how changes in our business operations affect non-selling cash costs per customer. In addition, CPU provides management with a useful measure to compare our non-selling cash costs per customer with those of other wireless providers. We believe investors use CPU primarily as a tool to track changes in our non-selling cash costs over time and to compare our non-selling cash costs to those of other wireless providers. Other wireless carriers may calculate this measure differently. The following table reconciles total costs used in the calculation of CPU to cost of service, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to CPU.

At December 31, 2006, we had a total of approximately $552.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, proceeds from our currently pending initial public offering, and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fully fund our projected operating and capital requirements for our existing business, currently planned expansion, planned enhancements of network capacity and upgrades for EVDO Revision A with VoIP, and service of our debt incurred in November 2006 through at least December 31, 2009. Our strategy has been to offer our services in major metropolitan areas and their surrounding areas, which we refer to as clusters. We are seeking opportunities to enhance our current market clusters and to provide service in new geographic areas. From time to time, we may purchase spectrum and related assets from third parties or the FCC. We participated as a bidder in FCC Auction 66 and in November 2006 we were granted eight licenses for a total aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion. See “Business — Auction 66 Markets.” As a result of the acquisition of the spectrum licenses from Auction 66 and the opportunities that these licenses provide for us to expand our operations into major metropolitan markets, we will require significant additional capital in the future to finance the construction and initial operating costs associated with such licenses, including clearing costs associated with non-governmental incumbent licenses which we currently estimate to be between approximately $40 million and $60 million. We generally do not intend to commence the construction of any individual license area until we have sufficient funds available to provide for the related construction and operating costs associated with such license area. We currently plan to focus on building out approximately 40 million of the total population in our Auction 66 Markets with a primary focus on the New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Las Vegas metropolitan areas. Of the approximate 40 million total population, we are targeting launch of operations with an initial covered population of approximately 30 to 32 million by late 2008 or early 2009. Total estimated capital expenditures to the launch of these operations are expected to be between $18 and $20 per covered population which equates to a total capital investment of approximately $550 million to $650 million. Total estimated expenditures, including capital expenditures, to become free cash flow positive, defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures, are expected to be approximately $29 to $30 per covered population, which equates to $875 million to $1.0 billion based on an estimated initial covered population of approximately 30 to 32 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, proceeds from our currently pending initial public offering, and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fully fund this planned expansion. Moreover, we have made no commitments for capital expenditures and we have the ability to reduce the rate of capital expenditure deployment. The construction of our network and the marketing and distribution of our wireless communications products and services have required, and will continue to require, substantial capital investment. Capital outlays have included license acquisition costs, capital expenditures for construction of our network infrastructure, costs associated with clearing and relocating non-governmental incumbent licenses, funding of operating cash flow losses incurred as we launch services in new metropolitan areas and other working capital costs, debt service and financing fees and expenses. Our capital expenditures for 2006 were approximately $550.7 million and aggregate capital expenditures for 2005 were approximately $266.5 million. These expenditures were primarily associated with the construction of the network infrastructure in our Expansion Markets and our efforts to increase the service area and capacity of our existing Core Markets network through the addition of cell sites and switches. We believe the increased service area and capacity in existing markets will improve our service offering, helping us to attract additional customers and increase revenues. In addition, we believe our new Expansion Markets have attractive demographics which will result in increased revenues. In connection with our payment of the purchase price for the Auction 66 licenses in October 2006, certain of our subsidiaries borrowed $1.25 billion under a secured bridge credit facility and an additional $250 million under a unsecured bridge credit facility. See “— Bridge Credit Facilities” below. The funds borrowed under the bridge credit facilities were used primarily to pay the aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion for the licenses we purchased in Auction 66. In November 2006, we consummated the sale of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 91/4% senior notes and entered into a senior secured credit facility, pursuant to which we may borrow up to $1.7 billion. We borrowed $1.6 billion under our senior secured credit facility concurrently with the closing of the sale of the 91/4% senior notes and used the amount borrowed, together with the net proceeds from the 82 Table of Contents sale of the 91/4% senior notes, to repay all amounts owed under the first and second lien credit agreements and the secured and unsecured bridge credit facilities and to pay the related premiums, fees and expenses and we intend to use the remaining amounts for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we owed an aggregate of approximately $2.6 billion under our senior secured credit facility and 91/4% Senior Notes. On February 20, 2007, MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. entered into an amendment to the senior secured credit facility. Under the amendment, the margin used to determine the senior secured credit facility interest rate was reduced to 2.25% from 2.50%. Our senior secured credit facility calculates consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as: consolidated net income plus depreciation and amortization; gain (loss) on disposal of assets; non-cash expenses; gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt; provision for income taxes; interest expense; and certain expenses of MetroPCS Communications minus interest and other income and non-cash items increasing consolidated net income. We consider Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, to be an important indicator to investors because it provides information related to our ability to provide cash flows to meet future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and fund future growth. We present this discussion of Adjusted EBITDA because covenants in our senior secured credit facility contain ratios based on this measure. If our Adjusted EBITDA were to decline below certain levels, covenants in our senior secured credit facility that are based on Adjusted EBITDA, including our maximum senior secured leverage ratio covenant, may be violated and could cause, among other things, an inability to incur further indebtedness and in certain circumstances a default or mandatory prepayment under our senior secured credit facility. Our maximum senior secured leverage ratio is required to be less than 4.5 to 1.0 based on Adjusted EBITDA plus the impact of certain new markets. The maximum senior secured leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of senior secured indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by our senior secured credit facility. For the year ended December 31, 2006, our senior secured leverage ratio was 3.24 to 1.0. In addition, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is also utilized, among other measures, to determine management’s compensation levels. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss), or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to, or more meaningful than cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The following table shows the calculation of our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our senior secured credit facility, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In Thousands) Calculation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 64,890 $ 198,677 $ 53,806 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 62,201 87,895 135,028 Loss (gain) on disposal of assets 3,209 (218,203 ) 8,806 Stock-based compensation expense(1) 10,429 2,596 14,472 Interest expense 19,030 58,033 115,985 Accretion of put option in majority-owned subsidiary(1) 8 252 770 Interest and other income (2,472 ) (8,658 ) (21,543 ) (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt (698 ) 46,448 51,518 Provision for income taxes 47,000 127,425 36,717 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax(1) — — — Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $ 203,597 $ 294,465 $ 395,559 (1) Represents a non-cash expense, as defined by our senior secured credit facility. In addition, for further information, the following table reconciles consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our senior secured credit facility, to cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006. 83 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In Thousands) Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 150,379 $ 283,216 $ 364,761 Adjustments: Interest expense 19,030 58,033 115,985 Non-cash interest expense (2,889 ) (4,285 ) (6,964 ) Interest and other income (2,472 ) (8,658 ) (21,543 ) Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable (125 ) (129 ) (31 ) Deferred rent expense (3,466 ) (4,407 ) (7,464 ) Cost of abandoned cell sites (1,021 ) (725 ) (3,783 ) Accretion of asset retirement obligation (253 ) (423 ) (769 ) Loss (gain) on sale of investments (576 ) 190 2,385 Provision for income taxes 47,000 127,425 36,717 Deferred income taxes (44,441 ) (125,055 ) (32,341 ) Changes in working capital 42,431 (30,717 ) (51,394 ) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $ 203,597 $ 294,465 $ 395,559 In connection with the closing of the sale of the 91/4% senior notes, the entry into our senior secured credit facility and the repayment of all amounts outstanding under our first and second lien credit agreements and secured and unsecured bridge credit facilities, we consummated a concurrent restructuring transaction. As a result of the restructuring transaction, MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. became a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of MetroPCS, Inc. (formerly MetroPCS V, Inc.), which is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. MetroPCS Communications, Inc. and MetroPCS, Inc. guaranteed the 91/4% senior notes and the obligations under the senior secured credit facility. MetroPCS, Inc. also pledged the capital stock of MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. as security for the obligations under the senior secured credit facility. All of our FCC licenses and our 85% limited liability company member interest in Royal Street Communications are now held by MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $364.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $283.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 as well as an increase in deferred revenues due to an approximately 53% increase in customers during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Cash provided by operating activities was $283.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $150.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to a significant increase in net income, including a $228.2 million gain on the sale of a 10 MHz portion of our 30MHz PCS license for the San Francisco — Oakland — San Jose basic trading area, and the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued expenses in the year ended December 31, 2005, partially offset by interest payments on the Credit Agreements that were executed in May 2005. Cash provided by operating activities was $150.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $112.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the net income, partially offset by an increase of $66.1 million used in cash due to changes in working capital compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase is primarily due to increases in inventories and the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued expenses. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $1.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $905.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was due primarily to a $887.7 million increase in purchases of FCC licenses and a $284.3 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a $355.5 million decrease in net purchases of investments. Cash used in investing activities was $905.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $190.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase was due primarily to a $416.9 million increase in the purchase of FCC licenses, an increase in purchases of investments in the amount of $580.8 million, 84 Table of Contents and a $27.5 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds of $230.0 million from the sale of a 10 MHz portion of our 30 MHz PCS license for the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose basic trading area. Cash used in investing activities was $190.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $306.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease during 2004 is primarily attributable to a $284.6 million increase in proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments, as well as a $50.5 million decrease in the purchases of investments, partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment in the amount of $133.1 million. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $712.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was due primarily to net proceeds from the senior secured credit facility and the 91/4% senior notes. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2005 was $712.2 million, compared to cash used in financing activities of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase during 2005 is mainly attributable to proceeds from borrowings under our Credit Agreements of $902.9 million as well as net proceeds from the issuance of Series E Preferred Stock in the amount of $46.7 million. These proceeds are partially offset by various transactions including repayment of the FCC notes in the amount of $33.4 million, repayment of the Senior Notes in the amount of $178.9 million, which included a premium of $28.9 million, and payment of debt issuance costs in the amount of $29.5 million. Cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2004 was $5.4 million, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $201.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. During 2003, we had net proceeds of $145.5 million from the issuance of our 103/4% Senior Notes and $65.5 million from the issuance of Series D Preferred Stock, which are the primary reasons for the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in 2004. First and Second Lien Credit Agreements On November 3, 2006, we paid the lenders under the first and second lien credit agreements $931.5 million plus accrued interest of $8.6 million to extinguish the aggregate outstanding principal balance under the first and second lien credit agreements. As a result, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of approximately $42.7 million. On November 21, 2006, we terminated the interest rate cap agreement that was required by our first and second lien credit agreements. We received approximately $4.3 million upon termination of the agreement. The proceeds from the termination of the agreement approximated its carrying value. Bridge Credit Facilities In July 2006, MetroPCS II, Inc., or MetroPCS II, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (which has since merged into MetroPCS Wireless, Inc.), entered into an Exchangeable Senior Secured Credit Agreement and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of July 13, 2006, or the secured bridge credit facility. The aggregate credit commitments available under the secured bridge credit facility were $1.25 billion and were fully funded. On November 3, 2006, MetroPCS II repaid the aggregate outstanding principal balance under the secured bridge credit facility of $1.25 billion and accrued interest of $5.9 million. As a result, MetroPCS II recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $7.0 million. In October 2006, MetroPCS IV, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (which has since merged into MetroPCS Wireless, Inc.), entered into an additional Exchangeable Senior Unsecured Bridge Credit Facility, or the unsecured bridge credit facility. The aggregate credit commitments available under the unsecured bridge credit facility were $250 million and were fully funded. 85 Table of Contents On November 3, 2006, MetroPCS IV, Inc. repaid the aggregate outstanding principal balance under the unsecured bridge credit facility of $250.0 million and accrued interest of $1.2 million. As a result, MetroPCS IV, Inc. recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $2.4 million. Senior Secured Credit Facility MetroPCS Wireless, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MetroPCS Communications, Inc., entered into the senior secured credit facility on November 3, 2006. The senior secured credit facility consists of a $1.6 billion term loan facility and a $100 million revolving credit facility. The term loan facility is repayable in quarterly installments in annual aggregate amounts equal to 1% of the initial aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion. The term loan facility will mature seven years following the date of its execution in November 2006. The revolving credit facility will mature five years following the date of its execution in November 2006. The facilities under the senior secured credit agreement are guaranteed by MetroPCS Communications, Inc., MetroPCS, Inc. and each of MetroPCS Wireless, Inc.’s direct and indirect present and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. The facilities are not guaranteed by Royal Street or its subsidiaries, but MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. has pledged the promissory note given by Royal Street in connection with amounts borrowed by Royal Street from MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. and we pledged the limited liability company member interests we hold in Royal Street. The senior secured credit facility contains customary events of default, including cross defaults. The obligations are also secured by the capital stock of MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. as well as substantially all of the present and future assets of MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. and each of its direct and indirect present and future wholly-owned subsidiaries (except as prohibited by law and certain permitted exceptions). Under the senior secured credit agreement, MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. will be subject to certain limitations, including limitations on its ability to incur additional debt, make certain restricted payments, sell assets, make certain investments or acquisitions, grant liens and pay dividends. MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. is also subject to certain financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum senior secured consolidated leverage ratio and, under certain circumstances, maximum consolidated leverage and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios. There is no prohibition on our ability to make investments in or loan money to Royal Street. Amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facility bear interest at a LIBOR rate plus a margin as set forth in the facility and the terms of the senior secured credit facility require us to enter into interest rate hedging agreements that fix the interest rate in an amount equal to at least 50% of our outstanding indebtedness, including the notes. On November 21, 2006, MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. entered into a three-year interest rate protection agreement to manage its interest rate risk exposure and fulfill a requirement of its senior secured credit facility. The agreement covers a notional amount of $1.0 billion and effectively converts this portion of MetroPCS Wireless, Inc.’s variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at an annual rate of 7.419%. The quarterly interest settlement periods begin on February 1, 2007. The interest rate protection agreement expires on February 1, 2010. On February 20, 2007, MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. entered into an amendment to the senior secured credit facility. Under the amendment, the margin used to determine the senior secured credit facility interest rate was reduced to 2.25% from 2.50%. 91/4% Senior Notes Due 2014 On November 3, 2006, MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. also consummated the sale of $1.0 billion principal amount of its 91/4% senior notes due 2014. The 91/4% senior notes are unsecured obligations and are guaranteed by MetroPCS Communications, Inc., MetroPCS, Inc., and all of MetroPCS Wireless, Inc.’s direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, but are not guaranteed by Royal Street or its subsidiaries. Interest is payable on the 91/4% senior notes on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning with May 1, 2007. MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 91/4% senior notes at any time on or after November 1, 2010 for the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 91/4% senior notes. In addition, MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 91/4% senior notes with the net cash proceeds of certain sales of equity securities, including the sale of common stock. 86 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures and Other Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions Capital Expenditures. We and Royal Street currently expect to incur approximately $650 million in capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2007 in our Core and Expansion Markets. In addition, we expect to incur approximately $175 million in capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2007 in our Auction 66 Markets. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we had $550.7 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion and improvement of our existing network infrastructure and costs associated with the construction of the Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit and Orlando Expansion Markets that we launched in 2006, as well as the Los Angeles Expansion Market that we expect to launch in the second or third quarter of 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we had $266.5 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion and improvement of our existing network infrastructure and costs associated with the construction of the Tampa/Sarasota, Dallas/Ft. Worth and Detroit Expansion Markets. Other Acquisitions and Dispositions. On April 19, 2004, we acquired four PCS licenses for an aggregate purchase price of $11.5 million. The PCS licenses cover 15 MHz of spectrum in each of the basic trading areas of Modesto, Merced, Eureka, and Redding, California. On October 29, 2004, we acquired two PCS licenses for an aggregate purchase price of $43.5 million. The PCS licenses cover 10 MHz of spectrum in each of the basic trading areas of Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida, and Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida. On November 28, 2004, we executed a license purchase agreement by which we agreed to acquire 10 MHz of PCS spectrum in the basic trading area of Detroit, Michigan and certain counties of the basic trading area of Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas for $230.0 million pursuant to a two-step, tax-deferred, like-kind exchange transaction under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. On December 20, 2004, we acquired a PCS license for a purchase price of $8.5 million. The PCS license covers 20 MHz of PCS spectrum in the basic trading area of Daytona Beach, Florida. On May 11, 2005, we completed the sale of a 10 MHz portion of our 30 MHz PCS license in the San Francisco — Oakland — San Jose basic trading area for cash consideration of $230.0 million. The sale was structured as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, through which our right, title and interest in and to the divested PCS spectrum was exchanged for the PCS spectrum acquired in Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas and Detroit, Michigan through a license purchase agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $230.0 million. The purchase of the PCS spectrum in Dallas/Ft. Worth and Detroit was accomplished in two steps with the first step of the exchange occurring on February 23, 2005 and the second step occurring on May 11, 2005 when we consummated the sale of 10 MHz of PCS spectrum for the San Francisco — Oakland — San Jose basic trading area. The sale of PCS spectrum resulted in a gain on disposal of asset in the amount of $228.2 million. On July 7, 2005, we acquired a 10 MHz F-Block PCS license for Grayson and Fannin counties in the basic trading area of Sherman-Denison, Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $0.9 million. On August 12, 2005, we closed on the purchase of a 10 MHz F-Block PCS license in the basic trading area of Bakersfield, California for an aggregate purchase price of $4.0 million. On December 21, 2005, the FCC granted Royal Street 10 MHz of PCS spectrum in each of the Los Angeles, California; Orlando, Lakeland-Winter Haven, Jacksonville, Melbourne-Titusville, and Gainesville, Florida basic trading areas. Royal Street, as the high bidder in Auction 58, had paid approximately $294.0 million to the FCC for these PCS licenses. On August 7, 2006, we acquired a 10 MHz PCS license in the basic trading area of Ocala, Florida in exchange for a 10 MHz portion of our 30 MHz PCS license in the basic trading area of Athens, Georgia. We paid $0.2 million at the closing of this agreement. On November 29, 2006, we were granted AWS licenses as a result of FCC Auction 66, for a total aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion. These new licenses cover six of the 25 largest metropolitan areas in the 87 Table of Contents United States. The east coast expansion opportunities include the entire east coast corridor from Philadelphia to Boston, including New York City, as well as the entire states of New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts. In the western United States, the new expansion opportunities include the San Diego, Portland, Seattle and Las Vegas metropolitan areas. The balance supplements or expands the geographic boundaries of our existing operations in Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table provides aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006. See Note 10 to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Payments Due by Period Less More Than Than Total 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt, including current portion $ 2,596,000 $ 16,000 $ 32,000 $ 32,000 $ 2,516,000 Interest expense on long-term debt(1) 1,601,613 218,185 436,370 436,370 510,688 Operating leases 728,204 88,639 180,873 179,277 279,415 Total cash contractual obligations $ 4,925,817 $ 322,824 $ 649,243 $ 647,647 $ 3,306,103 (1) Interest expense on long-term debt includes future interest payments on outstanding obligations under our senior secured credit facility and 91/4% senior notes. The senior secured credit facility bears interest at a floating rate tied to a fixed spread to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate. The interest expense presented in this table is based on the rates at December 31, 2006 which was 7.875% for the senior secured credit facility. Inflation We believe that inflation has not materially affected our operations. Effect of New Accounting Standards In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140” (“SFAS No. 155”). SFAS No. 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation, clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 133, establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives, and amends FASB Statement No. 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The adoption of this statement did not have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140” (“SFAS No. 156”). SFAS No. 156 amends SFAS No. 140 to require that all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. SFAS No. 156 permits, but does not require, the subsequent measurement of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value. Under SFAS No. 156, an entity can elect subsequent fair value measurement to account for its separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. Adoption of SFAS No. 156 is required as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The adoption of this statement did not have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” (“FIN No. 48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements 88 Table of Contents in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures, and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. While our analysis of the impact of this Interpretation is not yet complete, we do not anticipate it will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements,” (“SAB 108”), which addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. When the effect of initial adoption is material, companies may record the effect as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted this interpretation as of December 31, 2006. The adoption of this statement did not have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” (“SFAS No. 157”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 157 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We have not completed our evaluation of the effect of SFAS No. 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115,” (“SFAS No. 159”), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective of SFAS No. 159 is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008. We have not completed our evaluation of the effect of SFAS No. 159. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, including interest rates. We do not routinely enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading, speculative or hedging purposes, unless it is required by our credit agreements. We do not currently conduct business internationally, so we are generally not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $1.6 billion in outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility that bears interest at floating rates based on the London Inter Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.50%. The interest rate on the outstanding debt under our senior secured credit facility as of December 31, 2006 was 7.875%. On November 21, 2006, to manage our interest rate risk exposure and fulfill a requirement of our senior secured credit facility, we entered into a three-year interest rate protection agreement. This agreement covers a notional amount of $1.0 billion and effectively converts this portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at an annual rate of 7.419%. The quarterly interest settlement periods begin on February 1, 2007. The interest rate swap agreement expires in 2010. If market LIBOR rates increase 100 basis points over the rates in effect at December 31, 2006, annual interest expense on the approximately $600.0 million in variable rate debt would increase approximately $6.0 million.",2023-12-30 17:44:15.908959
1283699,TMUS,"T-Mobile US, Inc.",2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Company Overview Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are those of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. and Royal Street Communications, LLC. References to “MetroPCS,” “MetroPCS Communications,” “our Company,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer to MetroPCS Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Unless otherwise indicated, all share numbers and per share prices give effect to a 3 for 1 stock split effected by means of a stock dividend of two shares of common stock for each share of common stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on March 14, 2007. On April 18, 2007, the registration statement for our initial public offering became effective and our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “PCS” on April 19, 2007. We consummated our initial public offering of our common stock on April 24, 2007. We are a wireless telecommunications carrier that currently offers wireless broadband personal communication services, or PCS, primarily in the greater Atlanta, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco, Sacramento and Tampa/Sarasota/Orlando metropolitan areas. We launched service in the greater Atlanta, Miami and Sacramento metropolitan areas in the first quarter of 2002; in San Francisco in September 2002; in Tampa/Sarasota in October 2005; in Dallas/Ft. Worth in March 2006; in Detroit in April 2006; in Orlando in November 2006; and in Los Angeles in September 2007. In 2005, Royal Street Communications, LLC, or Royal Street Communications, and with its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “Royal Street”), was granted licenses by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, in Los Angeles and various metropolitan areas throughout northern Florida. We own 85% of the limited liability company member interests in Royal Street and we have a wholesale arrangement with Royal Street under which we purchase up to 85% of the engineered capacity of Royal Street’s systems allowing us to sell our standard products and services under the MetroPCS brand to the public. Royal Street has constructed or is in the process of constructing its network infrastructure in its licensed metropolitan areas. We commenced commercial services in Orlando and certain portions of northern Florida in November 2006, and in Los Angeles in September 2007 through our arrangements with Royal Street. As a result of the significant growth we have experienced since we launched operations, our results of operations to date are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected in future periods. Moreover, we expect that our number of customers will continue to increase, which will continue to contribute to increases in our revenues and operating expenses. In November 2006, we were granted advanced wireless services, or AWS, licenses currently covering a total population of approximately 126 million outside of where we then held or had access to spectrum for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion. Approximately 84 million of the total licensed population associated with our Auction 66 licenses represents expansion opportunities in geographic areas outside of our current operating markets, which we refer to as our Auction 66 Markets. These new expansion opportunities in our Auction 66 Markets cover six of the 25 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. The balance of our Auction 66 Markets, which currently cover a population of approximately 42 million, supplements or expands the geographic boundaries of our and Royal Street’s existing operations in Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento. We currently plan to focus on building out approximately 40 million of the total population in our Auction 66 Markets with a primary focus on the New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Las Vegas metropolitan areas. Of the approximate 40 million total population, we are targeting launch of operations with an initial covered population of approximately 30 to 32 million by late 2008 through the first half of 2009. Our initial launch dates will vary in our Auction 66 Markets and our launch dates in the larger metropolitan areas will be 47 Table of Contents accomplished in phases. Our Auction 66 Markets will entail a more extensive use of distributed antenna systems, or DAS, than we have deployed in the past. This, along with other factors, will result in an increase in total capital expenditures per covered population to initially launch operations, however, we would not expect the estimate of total cash expenditures to reach free cash flow positive to be materially impacted. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fully fund this planned expansion. We sell products and services to customers through our Company-owned retail stores as well as indirectly through relationships with independent retailers. We offer service which allows our customers to place unlimited local calls from within our local service area and to receive unlimited calls from any area while in our local service area, under simple and affordable flat monthly rate service plans starting at $30 per month. For an additional $5 to $20 per month, our customers may select a service plan that offers additional services, such as unlimited voicemail, caller ID, call waiting, enhanced directory assistance, unlimited text messaging, mobile Internet browsing, push e-mail, mobile instant messaging, picture and multimedia messaging and the ability to place unlimited long distance calls from within our local service calling area to any number in the continental United States. We offer flat-rate monthly plans at $30, $35, $40, $45 and $50. All of these plans require payment in advance for one month of service. If no payment is made in advance for the following month of service, service is discontinued at the end of the month that was paid for by the customer. For additional fees, we also provide international long distance and international text messaging, ringtones, ring back tones, downloads, games and content applications, unlimited directory assistance and other value-added services. As of December 31, 2007, over 85% of our customers have selected a $40 or higher rate plan. Our flat-rate plans differentiate our service from the more complex plans and long-term contract requirements of traditional wireless carriers. In addition, the above products and services are offered by us in the Royal Street markets. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. You should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this prospectus. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our accounting policy for income taxes was recently modified due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” (“FIN 48”) and is described below. On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures, and transition. FIN 48 requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. Changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently, affect our operating results. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Our wireless services are provided on a month-to-month basis and are paid in advance. We recognize revenues from wireless services as they are rendered. Amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Suspending service for non-payment is known as hotlining. We do not recognize revenue on hotlined customers. Revenues and related costs from the sale of accessories are recognized at the point of sale. The cost of handsets sold to indirect retailers are included in deferred charges until they are sold to and activated by customers. Amounts 48 Table of Contents billed to indirect retailers for handsets are recorded as accounts receivable and deferred revenue upon shipment by us and are recognized as equipment revenues when service is activated by customers. Our customers have the right to return handsets within a specified time or after a certain amount of use, whichever occurs first. We record an estimate for returns as contra-revenue at the time of recognizing revenue. Our assessment of estimated returns is based on historical return rates. If our customers’ actual returns are not consistent with our estimates of their returns, revenues may be different than initially recorded. Effective July 1, 2003, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 00-21, “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” (“EITF No. 00-21”), which is being applied on a prospective basis. EITF No. 00-21 also supersedes certain guidance set forth in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,” (“SAB 101”). SAB 101 was amended in December 2003 by Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 104, “Revenue Recognition.” The consensus addresses the accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting and the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the residual method of accounting. We determined that the sale of wireless services through our direct and indirect sales channels with an accompanying handset constitutes revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. Upon adoption of EITF No. 00-21, we began dividing these arrangements into separate units of accounting, and allocating the consideration between the handset and the wireless service using the residual method of accounting. Consideration received for the wireless service is recognized at fair value as service revenue when earned, and any remaining consideration received is recognized as equipment revenue when the handset is delivered and accepted by the customer. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our independent retailers to pay for equipment purchases and for amounts estimated to be uncollectible for intercarrier compensation. We estimate allowances for uncollectible accounts from independent retailers based on the length of time the receivables are past due, the current business environment and our historical experience. If the financial condition of a material portion of our independent retailers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific carrier’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record a specific allowance for intercarrier compensation against amounts due, to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. Total allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable as of December 31, 2007 was approximately 8% of the total amount of gross accounts receivable. Inventories We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value or replacement cost based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Total inventory reserves for obsolescent and unmarketable inventory were not significant as of December 31, 2007. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Deferred Income Tax Asset and Other Tax Reserves We assess our deferred tax asset and record a valuation allowance, when necessary, to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future taxable income, taxable temporary differences and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period we made that determination. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax returns are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and ultimately modified. We adjust the reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of income tax related reserve positions and changes to income tax reserves that we consider appropriate. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is finally resolved. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash or a reduction in our net operating loss carryforwards. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a 49 Table of Contents reduction to the effective rate in the year of resolution. Tax reserves as of December 31, 2007 were $26.0 million of which $4.8 million and $21.2 million are presented on the consolidated balance sheet in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures, and transition. FIN 48 requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. Changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently, affect our operating results. Property and Equipment Depreciation on property and equipment is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service, which are seven to ten years for network infrastructure assets including capitalized interest, three to seven years for office equipment, which includes computer equipment, three to seven years for furniture and fixtures and five years for vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease and any renewal periods reasonably assured or the estimated useful life of the improvement. The estimated life of property and equipment is based on historical experience with similar assets, as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. If technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation expense in future periods. Likewise, if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than anticipated, the life of the assets could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to property and equipment. This could result in a reduction of depreciation expense in future periods. We assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or in the strategy for our overall business. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. When we determine that the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, we measure any impairment based upon a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate we determine to be commensurate with the risk involved and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge associated with long-lived assets. The carrying value of property and equipment was approximately $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2007. Long-Term Investments The Company accounts for its investment securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” At December 31, 2007, all of the Company’s long-term investment securities were reported at fair value. Due to the lack of availability of observable market quotes on the Company’s investment portfolio of auction rate securities, the fair value was estimated based on our broker-dealer valuation models and an internal analysis by management of other-than-temporary impairment factors. The broker-dealer models considered credit default risks, the liquidity of the underlying security and overall capital market liquidity. Management also looked to other marketplace transactions, and information received from other third party brokers in order to assess whether the fair value based on the broker-dealer valuation models was reasonable. Declines in fair value that are considered other-than-temporary are charged to earnings and those that are considered temporary are reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. The Company has recorded an impairment charge of $97.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, reflecting the portion of the auction rate security holdings that the Company has concluded have an other-than-temporary decline in value. The valuation of the Company’s investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Factors that may impact the Company’s valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as the 50 Table of Contents underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral values, discount rates, counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity. The estimated market value of the Company’s auction rate security holdings at December 31, 2007 was approximately $36.1 million. The credit and capital markets have continued to deteriorate in 2008. If uncertainties in these markets continue, these markets deteriorate further or the Company experiences any additional ratings downgrades on any investments in its portfolio (including on auction rate securities), the Company may incur additional impairments to its investment portfolio. FCC Licenses and Microwave Relocation Costs We operate broadband PCS networks under licenses granted by the FCC for a particular geographic area on spectrum allocated by the FCC for broadband PCS services. In addition, in November 2006, we acquired a number of AWS licenses which can be used to provide services comparable to the PCS services provided by us, as well as other advanced wireless services. The PCS and AWS licenses included the obligation to relocate existing fixed microwave users of our licensed spectrum if our spectrum interfered with their systems and/or reimburse other carriers (according to FCC rules) that relocated prior users if the relocation benefits our system. Additionally, we incurred costs related to microwave relocation in constructing our PCS network. The PCS and AWS licenses and microwave relocation costs are recorded at cost. Although FCC licenses are issued with a stated term, ten years in the case of PCS licenses and fifteen years in the case of AWS licenses, the renewal of PCS and AWS licenses is generally a routine matter without substantial cost and we have determined that no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors currently exist that limit the useful life of our PCS and AWS licenses. The carrying value of FCC licenses and microwave relocation costs was approximately $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2007. Our primary indefinite-lived intangible assets are our FCC licenses. Based on the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and other Intangible Assets,” (“SFAS No. 142”) we test investments in our FCC licenses for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our FCC licenses might be impaired. We perform our annual FCC license impairment test as of each September 30th. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value with the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our FCC licenses using a discounted cash flow model. Cash flow projections and assumptions, although subject to a degree of uncertainty, are based on a combination of our historical performance and trends, our business plans and management’s estimate of future performance, giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive economic conditions. Other assumptions include our weighted average cost of capital and long-term rate of growth for our business. We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use to estimate fair value. We corroborate our determination of fair value of the FCC licenses, using the discounted cash flow approach described above, with other market-based valuation metrics. Furthermore, we segregate our FCC licenses by regional clusters for the purpose of performing the impairment test because each geographical region is unique. An impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related indefinite-lived intangible asset and charged to results of operations. Historically, we have not experienced significant negative variations between our assumptions and estimates when compared to actual results. However, if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be required to record to an impairment charge associated with indefinite-lived intangible assets. Although we do not expect our estimates or assumptions to change significantly in the future, the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our FCC licenses or using a methodology other than a discounted cash flow model could result in different values for our FCC licenses and may affect any related impairment charge. The most significant assumptions within our discounted cash flow model are the discount rate, our projected growth rate and management’s future business plans. A change in management’s future business plans or disposition of one or more FCC licenses could result in the requirement to test certain other FCC licenses. If any legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors were to limit the useful lives of our indefinite-lived FCC licenses, we would be required to test these intangible assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142 and amortize the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. For the license impairment test performed as of September 30, 2007, the fair value of the FCC licenses was in excess of its carrying value and no impairment has been recognized through December 31, 2007. 51 Table of Contents Share-Based Payments We account for share-based awards exchanged for employee services in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”). Under SFAS No. 123(R), share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. Prior to 2006, we recognized stock-based compensation expense for employee share-based awards based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant pursuant to Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” (“APB No. 25”) and followed the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure,” (“SFAS No. 148”), which amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” (“SFAS No. 123”). We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. Under the modified prospective transition method, prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or cancelled. Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, for awards outstanding at the effective date is recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated under SFAS No. 123 in prior periods. We have granted nonqualified stock options. Most of our stock option awards include a service condition that relates only to vesting. The stock option awards generally vest in one to four years from the grant date. Compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award. The determination of the fair value of stock options using an option-pricing model is affected by our common stock valuation as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. The methods used to determine these variables are generally similar to the methods used prior to 2006 for purposes of our pro forma information under SFAS No. 148. Prior to our initial public offering, factors that our Board of Directors considered in determining the fair market value of our common stock, include the recommendation of our finance and planning committee and of management based on certain data, including discounted cash flow analysis, comparable company analysis and comparable transaction analysis, as well as contemporaneous valuation reports. After our initial public offering, the Board of Directors uses the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant as the fair market value for our common stock. The volatility assumption is based on a combination of the historical volatility of our common stock and the volatilities of similar companies over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock options. The volatilities of similar companies are used in conjunction with our historical volatility because of the lack of sufficient relevant history equal to the expected term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. The expected term assumption is estimated based primarily on the stock options’ vesting terms and remaining contractual life and employees’ expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on the grant date appropriate for the term of the employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the expectation of no future dividend payouts by us. As share-based compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R) is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it is reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $28.0 million and $14.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The value of the options is determined by using a Black-Scholes pricing model that includes the following variables: 1) exercise price of the instrument, 2) fair market value of the underlying stock on date of grant, 3) expected life, 4) estimated volatility and 5) the risk-free interest rate. We utilized the following weighted-average assumptions in estimating the fair value of the options grants for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: 52 Table of Contents December 31, December 31, 2007 2006 Expected dividends 0.00 % 0.00 % Expected volatility 42.69 % 35.04 % Risk-free interest rate 4.54 % 4.64 % Expected lives in years 5.00 5.00 Weighted-average fair value of options: Granted at below fair value $ — $ 10.16 Granted at fair value $ 9.89 $ 3.75 Weighted-average exercise price of options: Granted at below fair value $ — $ 1.49 Granted at fair value $ 22.41 $ 9.95 The Black-Scholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions including expectations of future dividends and stock price volatility. Such assumptions are only used for making the required fair value estimate and should not be considered as indicators of future dividend policy or stock price appreciation. Because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, and because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, the use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model may not provide a reliable estimate of the fair value of employee stock options. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, the following awards were granted under our Option Plans: Weighted Weighted Weighted Number of Average Average Average Grants Made During Options Exercise Market Value Intrinsic Value the Quarter Ended Granted Price per Share per Share March 31, 2006 2,869,989 $ 7.15 $ 7.15 $ 0.00 June 30, 2006 534,525 $ 7.54 $ 7.54 $ 0.00 September 30, 2006 418,425 $ 8.67 $ 8.67 $ 0.00 December 31, 2006 7,546,854 $ 10.81 $ 11.33 $ 0.53 March 31, 2007 1,008,300 $ 11.33 $ 11.33 $ 0.00 June 30, 2007 5,912,098 $ 23.78 $ 23.78 $ 0.00 September 30, 2007 906,000 $ 30.60 $ 30.60 $ 0.00 December 31, 2007 650,600 $ 15.68 $ 15.68 $ 0.00 Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award. Customer Recognition and Disconnect Policies When a new customer subscribes to our service, the first month of service and activation fee is included with the handset purchase. Under GAAP, we are required to allocate the purchase price to the handset and to the wireless service revenue. Generally, the amount allocated to the handset will be less than our cost, and this difference is included in Cost Per Gross Addition, or CPGA. We recognize new customers as gross customer additions upon activation of service. Prior to January 23, 2006, we offered our customers the Metro Promise, which allowed a customer to return a newly purchased handset for a full refund prior to the earlier of 7 days or 60 minutes of use. Beginning on January 23, 2006, we expanded the terms of the Metro Promise to allow a customer to return a newly purchased handset for a full refund prior to the earlier of 30 days or 60 minutes of use. Customers who return their phones under the Metro Promise are reflected as a reduction to gross customer additions. Customers’ monthly service payments are due in advance every month. Our customers must pay their monthly service amount by the payment date or their service will be suspended, or hotlined, and the customer will not be able to make or receive calls on our network. However, a hotlined customer is still able to make E-911 calls in the event of an emergency. There is no service grace period. Any call attempted by a hotlined customer is routed directly to our interactive voice response system and customer service center in order to arrange payment. If the customer pays the amount due within 30 days of the original payment date then the customer’s service is restored. If a hotlined customer does not pay the amount due within 30 days of the payment date the account is disconnected and counted as churn. Once an account is disconnected we charge a $15 reconnect fee upon reactivation to reestablish service and the revenue associated with this fee is deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the customer. 53 Table of Contents Revenues We derive our revenues from the following sources: Service. We sell wireless broadband PCS services. The various types of service revenues associated with wireless broadband PCS for our customers include monthly recurring charges for airtime, monthly recurring charges for optional features (including nationwide long distance, unlimited text messaging, international text messaging, voicemail, downloads, ringtones, games and content applications, unlimited directory assistance, enhanced directory assistance, ring back tones, mobile Internet browsing, mobile instant messaging, push e-mail and nationwide roaming) and charges for long distance service. Service revenues also include intercarrier compensation and nonrecurring activation service charges to customers. Equipment. We sell wireless broadband PCS handsets and accessories that are used by our customers in connection with our wireless services. This equipment is also sold to our independent retailers to facilitate distribution to our customers. Costs and Expenses Our costs and expenses include: Cost of Service. The major components of our cost of service are: • Cell Site Costs. We incur expenses for the rent of cell sites, network facilities, engineering operations, field technicians and related utility and maintenance charges. • Intercarrier Compensation. We pay charges to other telecommunications companies for their transport and termination of calls originated by our customers and destined for customers of other networks. These variable charges are based on our customers’ usage and generally applied at pre-negotiated rates with other carriers, although some carriers have sought to impose such charges unilaterally. • Variable Long Distance. We pay charges to other telecommunications companies for long distance service provided to our customers. These variable charges are based on our customers’ usage, applied at pre-negotiated rates with the long distance carriers. Cost of Equipment. We purchase wireless broadband PCS handsets and accessories from third-party vendors to resell to our customers and independent retailers in connection with our services. We subsidize the sale of handsets to encourage the sale and use of our services. We do not manufacture any of this equipment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling expense includes advertising and promotional costs associated with marketing and selling to new customers and fixed charges such as retail store rent and retail associates’ salaries. General and administrative expense includes support functions including, technical operations, finance, accounting, human resources, information technology and legal services. We record stock-based compensation expense in cost of service and in selling, general and administrative expenses for expense associated with employee stock options, which is measured at the date of grant, based on the estimated fair value of the award. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service, which are seven to ten years for network infrastructure assets and capitalized interest, three to seven years for office equipment, which includes computer equipment, three to seven years for furniture and fixtures and five years for vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the respective leases, which includes renewal periods that are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense includes interest incurred on our borrowings, amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of discounts and premiums on long-term debt. Interest income is earned primarily on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Income Taxes. As a result of our operating losses and accelerated depreciation available under federal tax laws, we paid no federal income taxes prior to 2006. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we paid 54 Table of Contents approximately $0.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively, in federal income taxes. In addition, we have paid an $1.1 million and immaterial amount of state income tax during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Seasonality Our customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. Based on historical results, we generally expect net customer additions to be strongest in the first and fourth quarters. Softening of sales and increased customer turnover, or churn, in the second and third quarters of the year usually combine to result in fewer net customer additions. However, sales activity and churn can be strongly affected by the launch of new markets and promotional activity, which have the ability to reduce or outweigh certain seasonal effects.

Our chief operating decision maker is the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President. As of December 31, 2007, we had twelve operating segments based on geographic region within the United States: Atlanta, Boston, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Sacramento and Tampa/Sarasota/Orlando. Each of these operating segments provide wireless voice and data services and products to customers in its service areas or is currently constructing a network in order to provide these services. These services include unlimited local and long distance calling, voicemail, caller ID, call waiting, enhanced directory assistance, text messaging, picture and multimedia messaging, international long distance and international text messaging, ringtones, games and content applications, unlimited directory assistance, ring back tones, nationwide roaming, mobile Internet browsing, mobile instant messaging, push e-mail and other value-added services. We aggregate our operating segments into two reportable segments: Core Markets and Expansion Markets. • Core Markets, which include Atlanta, Miami, San Francisco, and Sacramento, are aggregated because they are reviewed on an aggregate basis by the chief operating decision maker, they are similar in respect to their products and services, production processes, class of customer, method of distribution, and regulatory environment and currently exhibit similar financial performance and economic characteristics. 55 Table of Contents • Expansion Markets, which include Boston, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and Tampa/Sarasota/Orlando, are aggregated because they are reviewed on an aggregate basis by the chief operating decision maker, they are similar in respect to their products and services, production processes, class of customer, method of distribution, and regulatory environment and have similar expected long-term financial performance and economic characteristics. General corporate overhead, which includes expenses such as corporate employee labor costs, rent and utilities, legal, accounting and auditing expenses, is allocated equally across all operating segments. Corporate marketing and advertising expenses are allocated equally to the operating segments, beginning in the period during which we launch service in that operating segment. Expenses associated with our national data center are allocated based on the average number of customers in each operating segment. All intercompany transactions between reportable segments have been eliminated in the presentation of operating segment data. Interest expense, interest income, gain/loss on extinguishment of debt and income taxes are not allocated to the segments in the computation of segment operating profit for internal evaluation purposes. 56 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Set forth below is a summary of certain financial information by reportable operating segment for the periods indicated: Reportable Operating Segment Data 2007 2006 Change (in thousands) REVENUES: Service revenues: Core Markets $ 1,414,917 $ 1,138,019 24 % Expansion Markets 504,280 152,928 230 % Total $ 1,919,197 $ 1,290,947 49 % Equipment revenues: Core Markets $ 220,364 $ 208,333 6 % Expansion Markets 96,173 47,583 102 % Total $ 316,537 $ 255,916 24 % OPERATING EXPENSES: Cost of service (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below) (1): Core Markets $ 439,162 $ 338,923 30 % Expansion Markets 208,348 106,358 96 % Total $ 647,510 $ 445,281 45 % Cost of equipment: Core Markets $ 385,100 $ 364,281 6 % Expansion Markets 212,133 112,596 88 % Total $ 597,233 $ 476,877 25 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below)(1): Core Markets $ 167,542 $ 158,100 6 % Expansion Markets 184,478 85,518 116 % Total $ 352,020 $ 243,618 44 % Adjusted EBITDA (Deficit)(2): Core Markets $ 654,112 $ 492,773 33 % Expansion Markets 12,883 (97,214 ) 113 % Depreciation and amortization: Core Markets $ 117,344 $ 109,626 7 % Expansion Markets 53,851 21,941 145 % Other 7,007 3,461 102 % Total $ 178,202 $ 135,028 32 % Stock-based compensation expense: Core Markets $ 10,635 $ 7,725 38 % Expansion Markets 17,389 6,747 158 % Total $ 28,024 $ 14,472 94 % Income (loss) from operations: Core Markets $ 529,194 $ 367,109 44 % Expansion Markets (58,818 ) (126,387 ) 53 % Other (10,262 ) (3,469 ) 196 % Total $ 460,114 $ 237,253 94 % (1) Cost of service and selling, general and administrative expenses include stock-based compensation expense.

Consolidated Data 2007 2006 Change (in thousands) Loss on disposal of assets $ 655 $ 8,806 (93 )% Interest expense 201,746 115,985 74 % Loss on extinguishment of debt — 51,518 100 % Impairment loss on investment securities 97,800 — 100 % Provision for income taxes 123,098 36,717 235 % Net income 100,403 53,806 87 % Loss on disposal of assets. Loss on disposal of assets decreased $8.1 million, or approximately 93%, to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily as a result of a gain on disposal of assets from the sale of certain network infrastructure assets related to a change in network technology related to our cell sites in certain markets. The gain was offset by a $3.0 million loss on the termination of a lease agreement during the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2006, certain network technology related to our cell sites in certain markets was retired and replaced with new technology, resulting in a loss on disposal of assets. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $85.7 million, or 74%, to $201.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 from $116.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increased average principal balance outstanding as a result of borrowings of $1.6 billion under our senior secured credit facility and the issuance of $1.0 billion of 91/4% senior notes due 2014, or initial notes, during the fourth quarter of 2006. The Company also issued an additional $400 million of 91/4% senior notes, or additional notes, during the second quarter of 2007. The Company had average debt outstanding for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 of $2.8 billion. The average debt outstanding for the twelve months ending December 31, 2006 was $1.3 billion. The weighted average interest rate decreased to 8.15% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 compared to 10.30% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 as a result of the borrowing rates under the senior secured credit facility, issuance of the initial notes and the additional notes, collectively referred to as the 91/4% senior notes, and the impact of the interest rate hedge. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by the capitalization of $34.9 million of interest during the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, compared to $17.5 million of interest capitalized during the same period in 2006. We capitalize 60 Table of Contents interest costs associated with our FCC licenses and property and equipment during the construction of a new market. The amount of such capitalized interest depends on the carrying values of the FCC licenses and construction in progress involved in those markets and the duration of the construction process. We expect capitalized interest to continue to be significant during the construction of the markets associated with the AWS licenses we were granted in November 2006 as a result of Auction 66. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. In November 2006, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our first and second lien credit agreements and the exchangeable secured and unsecured bridge credit agreements. As a result, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of approximately $42.7 million of the first and second lien credit agreements and an approximately $9.4 million loss on the extinguishment of the exchangeable secured and unsecured bridge credit agreements. Impairment Loss on Investment Securities. We can and have historically invested our substantial cash balances in, among other things, securities issued and fully guaranteed by the United States or any state, highly rated commercial paper and auction rate securities, money market funds meeting certain criteria, and demand deposits. These investments are subject to credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk. We made investments of $133.9 million in certain “AAA” rated auction rate securities some of which are secured by collateralized debt obligations with a portion of the underlying collateral being mortgage securities or related to mortgage securities. With the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets, the auction rate securities held by us at December 31, 2007 have experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale in the auctions has exceeded the amount of purchase orders. As a result, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss on investment securities in the amount of $97.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. See “— Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased to $123.1 million, which is approximately 55% of our income before provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes a tax valuation allowance on the impairment loss on investment securities equal to 15% of our income before provision in income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2006 the provision for income taxes was $36.7 million, or approximately 41% of income before provision for income taxes. Net Income. Net income increased $46.6 million, or 87%, to $100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $53.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is primarily attributable to a 35% growth in customers during the year ended December 31, 2007 as well as cost benefits achieved due to the increasing scale of our business in the Core and Expansion Markets. In addition, the increase in net income is due to a 197% increase in interest income as a result of the significant increase in our cash balances due to proceeds from our initial public offering and additional funding under our 91/4% senior notes. However, these benefits were partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to an increase in the Company’s average debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 as well as the $97.8 million impairment loss on investment securities. 61 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Set forth below is a summary of certain financial information by reportable operating segment for the periods indicated: Reportable Operating Segment Data 2006 2005 Change (In thousands) REVENUES: Service revenues: Core Markets $ 1,138,019 $ 868,681 31 % Expansion Markets 152,928 3,419 * * Total $ 1,290,947 $ 872,100 48 % Equipment revenues: Core Markets $ 208,333 $ 163,738 27 % Expansion Markets 47,583 2,590 * * Total $ 255,916 $ 166,328 54 % OPERATING EXPENSES: Cost of service (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below)(1): Core Markets $ 338,923 $ 271,437 25 % Expansion Markets 106,358 11,775 * * Total $ 445,281 $ 283,212 57 % Cost of equipment: Core Markets $ 364,281 $ 293,702 24 % Expansion Markets 112,596 7,169 * * Total $ 476,877 $ 300,871 59 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below)(1): Core Markets $ 158,100 $ 153,321 3 % Expansion Markets 85,518 9,155 * * Total $ 243,618 $ 162,476 50 % Adjusted EBITDA (Deficit)(2): Core Markets $ 492,773 $ 316,555 56 % Expansion Markets (97,214 ) (22,090 ) * * Depreciation and amortization: Core Markets $ 109,626 $ 84,436 30 % Expansion Markets 21,941 2,030 * * Other 3,461 1,429 142 % Total $ 135,028 $ 87,895 54 % Stock-based compensation expense: Core Markets $ 7,725 $ 2,596 198 % Expansion Markets 6,747 — * * Total $ 14,472 $ 2,596 457 % Income (loss) from operations: Core Markets $ 367,109 $ 219,777 67 % Expansion Markets (126,387 ) (24,370 ) * * Other (3,469 ) 226,770 (102 )% Total $ 237,253 $ 422,177 (44 )% ** Not meaningful.

Selling expenses increased $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase in selling expenses was related to marketing and advertising expenses associated with the launch of the Dallas/Ft. Worth metropolitan area, the Detroit metropolitan area, and the expansion of the Tampa/Sarasota area to include the Orlando metropolitan area. General and administrative expenses increased by $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 due to labor, rent, legal and professional fees and various administrative expenses incurred in relation to the launch of the Dallas/Ft. Worth metropolitan area, Detroit metropolitan area, and the expansion of the Tampa/Sarasota area to include the Orlando metropolitan area as well as build-out expenses related to the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $47.1 million, or 54%, to $135.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $87.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is primarily due to increases in Core Markets and Expansion Markets depreciation and amortization expense as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets depreciation and amortization expense increased $25.2 million, or 30%, to $109.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $84.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase related primarily to an increase in network infrastructure assets placed into service during the year ended December 31, 2006. We added approximately 350 cell sites in our Core Markets during this period to increase the capacity of our existing network and expand our footprint. 64 Table of Contents • Expansion Markets. Expansion Markets depreciation and amortization expense increased $19.9 million to $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase related to network infrastructure assets that were placed into service as a result of the launch of the Dallas/Ft. Worth metropolitan area, the Detroit metropolitan area, and expansion of the Tampa/Sarasota area to include the Orlando metropolitan area. Stock-Based Compensation Expense. Stock-based compensation expense increased $11.9 million, or 457%, to $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is primarily due to increases in Core Markets and Expansion Markets stock-based compensation expense as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets stock-based compensation expense increased $5.1 million, or 198%, to $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is primarily related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. In addition, in December 2006, we amended the stock option agreements of a former member of our board of directors to extend the contractual life of 405,054 vested options to purchase common stock until December 31, 2006. This amendment resulted in the recognition of additional stock-based compensation expense of approximately $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. • Expansion Markets. Expansion Markets stock-based compensation expense was $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. This expense is attributable to stock options granted to employees in our Expansion Markets which are being accounted for under SFAS No. 123(R) as of January 1, 2006. Consolidated Data 2006 2005 Change (In thousands) Loss (gain) on disposal of assets $ 8,806 $ (218,203 ) 104 % Loss on extinguishment of debt 51,518 46,448 11 % Interest expense 115,985 58,033 100 % Provision for income taxes 36,717 127,425 (72 )% Net income 53,806 198,677 (73 )% Loss (Gain) on Disposal of Assets. In May 2005, we completed the sale of a 10 MHz portion of our 30 MHz PCS license in the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose basic trading area for cash consideration of $230.0 million. The sale of PCS spectrum resulted in a gain on disposal of asset in the amount of $228.2 million. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. In November 2006, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our first and second lien credit agreements and the exchangeable secured and unsecured bridge credit agreements. As a result, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of approximately $42.7 million of the first and second lien credit agreements and an approximately $9.4 million loss on the extinguishment of the exchangeable secured and unsecured bridge credit agreements. In May 2005, we repaid all of the outstanding debt under our FCC notes, 103/4% senior notes and bridge credit agreement. As a result, we recorded a $1.9 million loss on the extinguishment of the FCC notes; a $34.0 million loss on extinguishment of the 103/4% senior notes due 2011, or 103/4% senior notes; and a $10.4 million loss on the extinguishment of the bridge credit agreement. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $58.0 million, or 100%, to $116.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased average principal balance outstanding as a result of additional borrowings of $150.0 million under our first and second lien credit agreements in the fourth quarter of 2005, $200.0 million under the secured bridge credit facility in the third quarter of 2006 and an additional $1,300.0 million under the secured and unsecured bridge credit facilities in the fourth quarter of 2006. Interest expense also increased due to the weighted average interest rate increasing to 10.30% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 8.92% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by the capitalization of $17.5 million of interest during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $3.6 million of interest capitalized during the same period in 2005. We capitalize interest costs associated with our FCC licenses and property and equipment beginning with pre-construction period administrative and technical activities, which includes obtaining leases, zoning approvals and building permits. The amount of such capitalized interest depends on the carrying values of the FCC licenses and construction in progress involved in those markets and the duration of the construction process. With respect to our FCC licenses, capitalization of interest costs ceases at the point in time in which the asset is ready for its intended use, which generally coincides with the market launch date. In the case of our property and equipment, capitalization of interest costs ceases at the point in time in which the network assets 65 Table of Contents are placed into service. We expect capitalized interest to be significant during the construction of our additional Expansion Markets and related network assets. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased to $36.7 million, which is approximately 41% of our income before provision for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2005 the provision for income taxes was $127.4 million, or approximately 39% of income before provision for income taxes. The year ended December 31, 2005 included a gain on the sale of a 10 MHz portion of our 30 MHz PCS license in the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose basic trading area in the amount of $228.2 million. Net Income. Net income decreased $144.9 million, or 73%, to $53.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $198.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The significant decrease is primarily attributable to our non-recurring sale of a 10 MHz portion of our 30 MHz PCS license in the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose basic trading area in May 2005 for cash consideration of $230.0 million. The sale of PCS spectrum resulted in a gain on disposal of asset in the amount of $139.2 million, net of income taxes. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, excluding the tax effected impact of the gain on the sale of the PCS license, decreased approximately 10%. The decrease in net income, excluding the tax effected impact of the gain on the sale of spectrum, is primarily due to the increase in operating losses in our Expansion Markets. Performance Measures In managing our business and assessing our financial performance, we supplement the information provided by financial statement measures with several customer-focused performance metrics that are widely used in the wireless industry. These metrics include average revenue per user per month, or ARPU, which measures service revenue per customer; cost per gross customer addition, or CPGA, which measures the average cost of acquiring a new customer; cost per user per month, or CPU, which measures the non-selling cash cost of operating our business on a per customer basis; and churn, which measures turnover in our customer base. For a reconciliation of Non-GAAP performance measures and a further discussion of the measures, please read “— Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. The following table shows annual metric information for 2005, 2006 and 2007. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 Customers: End of period 1,924,621 2,940,986 3,962,786 Net additions 525,889 1,016,365 1,021,800 Churn: Average monthly rate 5.1 % 4.6 % 4.7 % ARPU $ 42.40 $ 42.98 $ 43.03 CPGA $ 102.70 $ 117.58 $ 124.16 CPU $ 19.57 $ 19.65 $ 18.33 Customers. Net customer additions were 1,021,800 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 1,016,365 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total customers were 3,962,786 as of December 31, 2007, an increase of 35% over the customer total as of December 31, 2006. The increase in total customers is primarily attributable to the continued demand for our service offerings and the launch of our services in the Los Angeles metropolitan area in September 2007. Net customer additions were 1,016,365 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 525,889 for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 93%. Total customers were 2,940,986 as of December 31, 2006, an increase of 53% over the customer total as of December 31, 2005. The increase in total customers is largely attributable to the continued demand for our service offerings and the launch of our services in the Dallas/Ft. Worth metropolitan area in March 2006 and the Detroit metropolitan area in April 2006. Churn. As we do not require a long-term service contract, our churn percentage is expected to be higher than traditional wireless carriers that require customers to sign a one- to two-year contract with significant early termination fees. Average monthly churn represents (a) the number of customers who have been disconnected from our system during the measurement period less the number of customers who have reactivated service, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. We classify delinquent customers as churn after they have been delinquent for 30 days. In addition, when an existing customer establishes a new account in connection with the purchase of an upgraded or replacement phone and does not identify themselves as an 66 Table of Contents existing customer, we count the phone leaving service as a churn and the new phone entering service as a gross customer addition. Churn for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 4.7% compared to 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Churn increased 0.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the year ended December 31, 2006 due to normal historical trends related to the maturity of our markets coupled with continued disconnects from the significant increase in gross additions in the first quarter of 2007 compared to the first quarter of 2006. Churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 4.6% compared to 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Based upon a change in the allowable return period from 7 days to 30 days, we revised our definition of gross customer additions to exclude customers that discontinue service in the first 30 days of service. This revision reduces deactivations and gross customer additions commencing March 23, 2006, and reduces churn. Our customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. Based on historical results, we generally expect net customer additions to be strongest in the first and fourth quarters. Softening of sales and increased churn in the second and third quarters of the year usually combine to result in fewer net customer additions during these quarters. Average Revenue Per User. ARPU represents (a) service revenues less activation revenues, E-911, FUSF, and vendor’s compensation charges for the measurement period, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. ARPU was $43.03 and $42.98 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase of $0.05. ARPU increased $0.58, or approximately 1.4%, during 2006 from $42.40 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in ARPU was primarily the result of attracting customers to higher priced service plans. At December 31, 2007, over 85% of our customers were on the $40 or higher rate plan. Cost Per Gross Addition. CPGA is determined by dividing (a) selling expenses plus the total cost of equipment associated with transactions with new customers less activation revenues and equipment revenues associated with transactions with new customers during the measurement period by (b) gross customer additions during such period. Retail customer service expenses and equipment margin on handsets sold to existing customers when they are identified, including handset upgrade transactions, are excluded, as these costs are incurred specifically for existing customers. CPGA costs have increased to $124.16 for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $117.58 for the year ended December 31, 2006, which was primarily driven by the selling expenses and equipment subsidy associated with the customer growth in our Expansion Markets as well as selling expenses associated with the launch of service in the Los Angles metropolitan area. CPGA costs increased to $117.58 for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $102.70 for the year ended December 31, 2005, which was primarily driven by the selling expenses associated with the launch of service in the Dallas/Ft. Worth metropolitan area, the Detroit metropolitan area and the expansion of the Tampa/Sarasota area to include the Orlando metropolitan area. In addition, on January 23, 2006, we revised the terms of our return policy from 7 days to 30 days, and as a result we revised our definition of gross customer additions to exclude customers that discontinue service in the first 30 days of service. This revision, commencing March 23, 2006, reduces deactivations and gross customer additions and increases CPGA. Cost Per User. CPU is cost of service and general and administrative costs (excluding applicable non-cash stock-based compensation expense included in cost of service and general and administrative expense) plus net loss on handset equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition (which includes the gain or loss on sale of handsets to existing customers and costs associated with handset replacements and repairs (other than warranty costs which are the responsibility of the handset manufacturers)), divided by sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. CPU for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $18.33 and $19.65, respectively. CPU for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $19.57. We continue to achieve cost benefits due to the increasing scale of our business. However, these benefits have been offset by a combination of the construction and launch expenses associated with our Expansion Markets, which contributed approximately $3.36 and $3.42 of additional CPU for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, CPU has increased historically due to costs associated with higher ARPU service plans such as those related to unlimited nationwide long distance. During the year ended December 31, 2005, CPU was impacted by substantial legal and accounting expenses in the amount of approximately $5.9 million associated with an internal investigation related to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as well as financial statement audits related to our restatement efforts. 67 Table of Contents The following table shows quarterly metric information for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007.

A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows; or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented. ARPU, CPGA, and CPU are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to judge our ability to meet our liquidity requirements and to evaluate our operating performance. We believe these measures are important in understanding the performance of our operations from period to period, and although every company in the wireless industry does not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures (which are common in the wireless industry) facilitate key liquidity and operating performance comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry. The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures with our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. ARPU — We utilize ARPU to evaluate our per-customer service revenue realization and to assist in forecasting our future service revenues. ARPU is calculated exclusive of activation revenues, as these amounts are a component of our costs of acquiring new customers and are included in our calculation of CPGA. ARPU is also calculated exclusive of E-911, FUSF and vendor’s compensation charges, as these are generally pass through charges that we collect from our customers and remit to the appropriate government agencies. Average number of customers for any measurement period is determined by dividing (a) the sum of the average monthly number of customers for the measurement period by (b) the number of months in such period. Average monthly number of customers for any month represents the sum of the number of customers on the first day of the month and the last day of the month divided by two. The following table shows the calculation of ARPU for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 (In thousands, except average number of customers and ARPU) Calculation of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Service revenues $ 872,100 $ 1,290,947 $ 1,919,197 Less: Activation revenues (6,808 ) (8,297 ) (11,425 ) E-911, FUSF and vendor’s compensation charges (26,221 ) (45,640 ) (95,946 ) Net service revenues $ 839,071 $ 1,237,010 $ 1,811,826 Divided by: Average number of customers 1,649,208 2,398,682 3,508,497 ARPU $ 42.40 $ 42.98 $ 43.03 70 Table of Contents Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, 2006 2006 2006 2006 (In thousands, except average number of customers and ARPU) Calculation of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Service revenues $ 275,416 $ 307,843 $ 332,920 $ 374,768 Less: Activation revenues (1,923 ) (1,979 ) (2,123 ) (2,272 ) E-911, FUSF and vendor’s compensation charges (8,958 ) (10,752 ) (9,512 ) (16,418 ) Net service revenues $ 264,535 $ 295,112 $ 321,285 $ 356,078 Divided by: Average number of customers 2,045,110 2,295,249 2,503,423 2,750,943 ARPU $ 43.12 $ 42.86 $ 42.78 $ 43.15 Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, 2007 2007 2007 2007 (In thousands, except average number of customers and ARPU) Calculation of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Service revenues $ 439,516 $ 479,341 $ 489,131 $ 511,209 Less: Activation revenues (2,459 ) (2,683 ) (2,995 ) (3,287 ) E-911, FUSF and vendor’s compensation charges (20,271 ) (25,721 ) (25,215 ) (24,740 ) Net service revenues $ 416,786 $ 450,937 $ 460,921 $ 483,182 Divided by: Average number of customers 3,175,284 3,480,780 3,592,045 3,785,880 ARPU $ 43.75 $ 43.18 $ 42.77 $ 42.54 CPGA — We utilize CPGA to assess the efficiency of our distribution strategy, validate the initial capital invested in our customers and determine the number of months to recover our customer acquisition costs. This measure also allows us to compare our average acquisition costs per new customer to those of other wireless broadband PCS providers. Activation revenues and equipment revenues related to new customers are deducted from selling expenses in this calculation as they represent amounts paid by customers at the time their service is activated that reduce our acquisition cost of those customers. Additionally, equipment costs associated with existing customers, net of related revenues, are excluded as this measure is intended to reflect only the acquisition costs related to new customers. The following table reconciles total costs used in the calculation of CPGA to selling expenses, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to CPGA.

CPU does not include any depreciation and amortization expense. Management uses CPU as a tool to evaluate the non-selling cash expenses associated with ongoing business operations on a per customer basis, to track changes in these non-selling cash costs over time, and to help evaluate how changes in our business operations affect non-selling cash costs per customer. In addition, CPU provides management with a useful measure to compare our non-selling cash costs per customer with those of other wireless providers. We believe investors use CPU primarily as a tool to track changes in our non-selling cash costs over time and to compare our non-selling cash costs to those of other wireless providers. Other wireless carriers may calculate this measure differently. The following table reconciles total costs used in the calculation of CPU to cost of service, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to CPU. 72 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 (In thousands, except average number of customers and CPU) Calculation of Cost Per User (CPU): Cost of service $ 283,212 $ 445,281 $ 647,510 Add: General and administrative expense 100,080 138,998 198,955 Add: Net loss on equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition 32,791 41,538 49,331 Less: Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of service and general and administrative expense (2,596 ) (14,472 ) (28,024 ) Less: E-911, FUSF and vendor’s compensation revenues (26,221 ) (45,640 ) (95,946 ) Total costs used in the calculation of CPU $ 387,266 $ 565,705 $ 771,826 Divided by: Average number of customers 1,649,208 2,398,682 3,508,497 CPU $ 19.57 $ 19.65 $ 18.33 Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, 2006 2006 2006 2006 (In thousands, except average number of customers and CPU) Calculation of Cost Per User (CPU): Cost of service $ 92,489 $ 107,497 $ 113,524 $ 131,771 Add: General and administrative expense 31,139 33,827 34,158 39,874 Add: Net loss on equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition 10,500 7,765 9,457 13,816 Less: Stock-based compensation expense included in general and administrative expense (1,811 ) (2,158 ) (3,781 ) (6,722 ) Less: E-911, FUSF and vendor’s compensation revenues (8,958 ) (10,752 ) (9,512 ) (16,418 ) Total costs used in the calculation of CPU $ 123,359 $ 136,179 $ 143,846 $ 162,321 Divided by: Average number of customers 2,045,110 2,295,249 2,503,423 2,750,943 CPU $ 20.11 $ 19.78 $ 19.15 $ 19.67 Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, 2007 2007 2007 2007 (In thousands, except average number of customers and CPU) Calculation of Cost Per User (CPU): Cost of service $ 145,335 $ 162,227 $ 163,671 $ 176,277 Add: General and administrative expense 42,831 49,352 48,871 57,900 Add: Net loss on equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition 13,160 9,903 11,664 14,606 Less: Stock-based compensation expense included in general and administrative expense (4,211 ) (7,653 ) (7,107 ) (9,053 ) Less: E-911, FUSF and vendor’s compensation revenues (20,271 ) (25,721 ) (25,215 ) (24,740 ) Total costs used in the calculation of CPU $ 176,844 $ 188,108 $ 191,884 $ 214,990 Divided by: Average number of customers 3,175,284 3,480,780 3,592,045 3,785,880 CPU $ 18.56 $ 18.01 $ 17.81 $ 18.93 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and cash generated from operations. At December 31, 2007, we had a total of approximately $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We have historically invested our substantial cash balances in, among other things, securities issued and fully guaranteed by the United States or any state, highly rated commercial paper and auction rate securities, money 73 Table of Contents market funds meeting certain criteria, and demand deposits. These investments are subject to credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk. At December 31, 2007, we had invested substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents in money market funds consisting of U.S. treasury securities. We hold investments of $133.9 million in certain auction rate securities some of which are secured by collateralized debt obligations with a portion of the underlying collateral being mortgage securities or related to mortgage securities. Consistent with our investment policy guidelines, the auction rate securities investments held by us all had AAA credit ratings at the time of purchase. With the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets, the auction rate securities held by us at December 31, 2007 have experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale in the auctions has exceeded the amount of purchase orders. In addition, three auction rate securities held by us have been placed on credit watch. However, as of January 31, 2008, all of the auction rate securities held by us still retain a AAA/Aaa rating as reported by Standard and Poors and Moody’s Investors Service. The estimated market value of our auction rate security holdings at December 31, 2007 was approximately $36.1 million, which reflects a $97.8 million adjustment to the principal value of $133.9 million. Although the auction rate securities continue to pay interest according to their stated terms, based on statements received from our broker and an analysis of other-than-temporary impairment factors, we have recorded an impairment charge of $97.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, reflecting the portion of auction rate security holdings that we have concluded have an other-than-temporary decline in value. Historically, given the liquidity created by the auctions, our auction rate securities were presented as current assets under short-term investments on our balance sheet. Given the failed auctions, our auction rate securities are illiquid until there is a successful auction for them. Accordingly, the entire amount of such remaining auction rate securities has been reclassified from current to non-current assets and is presented in long-term investments on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. The $97.8 million impairment charge does not have a material impact on our liquidity and is not included in our approximately $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2007. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue or these markets deteriorate further, we may incur additional impairments to its auction rate securities. Management believes that any future additional impairment charges will not have a material effect on our liquidity. On April 24, 2007, MetroPCS Communications consummated an initial public offering of its common stock. MetroPCS Communications sold 37,500,000 shares of common stock at a price per share of $23.00 (less underwriting discounts and commissions), which resulted in net proceeds to MetroPCS Communications of approximately $818.3 million. In addition, selling stockholders sold an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of common stock, including 7,500,000 shares sold pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option. MetroPCS Communications did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders; however, MetroPCS Communications did receive proceeds of approximately $3.8 million from the exercise of options to acquire common stock which was sold in the initial public offering. Concurrent with the initial public offering by MetroPCS Communications, all outstanding shares of preferred stock of MetroPCS Communications, including accrued but unpaid dividends as of April 23, 2007, were converted into 150,962,644 shares of common stock. We intend to use the net proceeds from the initial public offering primarily to build out our network and launch our services in certain of our recently acquired Auction 66 Markets as well as for general corporate purposes. On June 6, 2007, MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. consummated the sale of the additional notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400 million. The proceeds from the sale of the additional notes were approximately $421.0 million which we intend to use for general corporate purposes. Our strategy has been to offer our services in major metropolitan areas and their surrounding areas, which we refer to as operating segments. We continue to seek opportunities to enhance our current operating segments and to provide service in new geographic areas, and from time to time, we may purchase spectrum and related assets from third parties or the FCC. We participated as a bidder in FCC Auction 66 and in November 2006 we were granted eight licenses for a total aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion. As a result of the acquisition of the spectrum licenses from Auction 66 and the opportunities that these licenses provide for us to expand our operations into major metropolitan markets, we will require significant additional capital in the future to finance the construction and initial operating costs associated with such licenses. We generally do not intend to commence the construction of any individual license area until we have sufficient funds available to provide for the related construction and operating costs associated with such license area. We currently plan to focus on building out approximately 40 million of the total population in our Auction 66 Markets with a primary focus on the New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Las Vegas metropolitan areas. Of the approximate 40 million total population, we are targeting launch of operations with an initial covered population of 74 Table of Contents approximately 30 to 32 million by late 2008 through the first half of 2009. Our initial launch dates will vary in our Auction 66 Markets and our launch dates in the larger metropolitan areas may be accomplished in phases. Our Auction 66 Markets will entail a more extensive use of DAS systems than we have used in the past. This, along with other factors, will result in an increase in the total capital expenditures per covered population to initially launch operations, however, we would not expect the estimate of total cash expenditures to reach free cash flow positive to be materially impacted. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fully fund this planned expansion. The construction of our network and the marketing and distribution of our wireless communications products and services have required, and will continue to require, substantial capital investment. Capital outlays have included license acquisition costs, capital expenditures for construction of our network infrastructure, costs associated with clearing and relocating non-governmental incumbent licenses, funding of operating cash flow losses incurred as we launch services in new metropolitan areas and other working capital costs, debt service and financing fees and expenses. Our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2007 were approximately $767.7 million. Our capital expenditures for 2006 were approximately $550.7 million and capital expenditures for 2005 were approximately $266.5 million. These expenditures were primarily associated with the construction of the network infrastructure in our Expansion Markets and our efforts to increase the service area and capacity of our existing Core Markets network through the addition of cell sites and switches. We believe the increased service area and capacity in existing markets will improve our service offering, helping us to attract additional customers and increase revenues. In addition, we believe our new Expansion Markets have attractive demographics which will result in increased revenues. On February 20, 2007, MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. entered into an amendment to the senior secured credit facility. Under the amendment, the margin used to determine the senior secured credit facility interest rate was reduced to 2.25% from 2.50%. As of December 31, 2007, we owed an aggregate of approximately $3.0 billion under our senior secured credit facility and 91/4% senior notes. Our senior secured credit facility calculates consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as: consolidated net income plus depreciation and amortization; gain (loss) on disposal of assets; non-cash expenses; gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt; provision for income taxes; interest expense; and certain expenses of MetroPCS Communications minus interest and other income and non-cash items increasing consolidated net income. We consider Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, to be an important indicator to investors because it provides information related to our ability to provide cash flows to meet future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and fund future growth. We present this discussion of Adjusted EBITDA because covenants in our senior secured credit facility contain ratios based on this measure. If our Adjusted EBITDA were to decline below certain levels, covenants in our senior secured credit facility that are based on Adjusted EBITDA, including our maximum senior secured leverage ratio covenant, may be violated and could cause, among other things, an inability to incur further indebtedness and in certain circumstances a default or mandatory prepayment under our senior secured credit facility. Our maximum senior secured leverage ratio is required to be less than 4.5 to 1.0 based on Adjusted EBITDA plus the impact of certain new markets. The lenders under our senior secured credit facility use the senior secured leverage ratio to measure our ability to meet our obligations on our senior secured debt by comparing the total amount of such debt to our Adjusted EBITDA, which our lenders use to estimate our cash flow from operations. The senior secured leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of senior secured indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by our senior secured credit facility. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, our senior secured leverage ratio was 2.10 to 1.0, which means for every $1.00 of Adjusted EBITDA we had $2.10 of senior secured indebtedness. In addition, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is also utilized, among other measures, to determine management’s compensation levels. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss), or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to, or more meaningful than cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. 75 Table of Contents The following table shows the calculation of our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our senior secured credit facility, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 (In Thousands) Calculation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 198,677 $ 53,806 $ 100,403 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 87,895 135,028 178,202 (Gain) loss on disposal of assets (218,203 ) 8,806 655 Stock-based compensation expense(1) 2,596 14,472 28,024 Interest expense 58,033 115,985 201,746 Accretion of put option in majority-owned subsidiary(1) 252 770 1,003 Interest and other income (8,658 ) (21,543 ) (63,936 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt 46,448 51,518 — Impairment loss on investment securities — — 97,800 Provision for income taxes 127,425 36,717 123,098 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $ 294,465 $ 395,559 $ 666,995 (1) Represents a non-cash expense, as defined by our senior secured credit facility. In addition, for further information, the following table reconciles consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our senior secured credit facility, to cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 (In Thousands) Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 283,216 $ 364,761 $ 589,306 Adjustments: Interest expense 58,033 115,985 201,746 Non-cash interest expense (4,285 ) (6,964 ) (3,259 ) Interest and other income (8,658 ) (21,543 ) (63,936 ) Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable (129 ) (31 ) (129 ) Deferred rent expense (4,407 ) (7,464 ) (13,745 ) Cost of abandoned cell sites (725 ) (3,783 ) (6,704 ) Accretion of asset retirement obligation (423 ) (769 ) (1,439 ) Gain on sale of investments 190 2,385 10,506 Provision for income taxes 127,425 36,717 123,098 Deferred income taxes (125,055 ) (32,341 ) (118,524 ) Changes in working capital (30,717 ) (51,394 ) (49,925 ) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $ 294,465 $ 395,559 $ 666,995 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $589.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $364.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to a 87% increase in net income as well as a 266% increase in deferred income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Cash provided by operating activities was $364.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $283.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 as well as an increase in deferred revenues due to an approximately 53% increase in customers during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Cash provided by operating activities was $283.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $150.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to a significant increase in net income, including a $228.2 million gain on the sale of a 10 MHz portion of our 30MHz PCS license for the San Francisco — Oakland — San Jose basic trading area, and the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued expenses in the year ended December 31, 2005, partially offset by interest payments on the first and second lien credit agreements that were executed in May 2005. 76 Table of Contents Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $517.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $1.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was due mainly due to $1.4 billion in purchases of FCC licenses during the year ended December 31, 2006 that did not recur in 2007 as well as a $264.7 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of investments, partially offset by a $217.0 million increase in purchases of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities was $1.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $905.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was due primarily to a $887.7 million increase in purchases of FCC licenses and a $284.3 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a $355.5 million decrease in net purchases of investments. Cash used in investing activities was $905.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $190.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase was due primarily to a $416.9 million increase in the purchase of FCC licenses, an increase in purchases of investments in the amount of $580.8 million, and a $27.5 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds of $230.0 million from the sale of a 10 MHz portion of our 30 MHz PCS license for the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose basic trading area. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in proceeds from various financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2007 included $818.3 million in net proceeds from the company’s initial public offering that was completed in April 2007 and $421.0 million in net proceeds from the sale of additional notes in June 2007. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $712.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was due primarily to net proceeds from the senior secured credit facility and the 91/4% senior notes. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2005 was $712.2 million, compared to cash used in financing activities of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase during 2005 is mainly attributable to proceeds from borrowings under our first and second lien credit agreements of $902.9 million as well as net proceeds from the issuance of Series E Preferred Stock in the amount of $46.7 million. These proceeds are partially offset by various transactions including repayment of the FCC notes in the amount of $33.4 million, repayment of the 103/4% senior notes in the amount of $178.9 million, which included a premium of $28.9 million, and payment of debt issuance costs in the amount of $29.5 million. First and Second Lien Credit Agreements On November 3, 2006, we paid the lenders under the first and second lien credit agreements $931.5 million plus accrued interest of $8.6 million to extinguish the aggregate outstanding principal balance under the first and second lien credit agreements. As a result, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of approximately $42.7 million. On November 21, 2006, we terminated the interest rate cap agreement that was required by our first and second lien credit agreements. We received approximately $4.3 million upon termination of the agreement. The proceeds from the termination of the agreement approximated its carrying value. Bridge Credit Facilities In July 2006, MetroPCS II, Inc., or MetroPCS II, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (which has since merged into MetroPCS Wireless, Inc.), entered into an Exchangeable Senior Secured Credit Agreement and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of July 13, 2006, or the secured bridge credit facility. The aggregate credit commitments available under the secured bridge credit facility were $1.25 billion and were fully funded. 77 Table of Contents On November 3, 2006, MetroPCS II repaid the aggregate outstanding principal balance under the secured bridge credit facility of $1.25 billion and accrued interest of $5.9 million. As a result, MetroPCS II recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $7.0 million. In October 2006, MetroPCS IV, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (which has since merged into MetroPCS Wireless, Inc.), entered into an additional Exchangeable Senior Unsecured Bridge Credit Facility, or the unsecured bridge credit facility. The aggregate credit commitments available under the unsecured bridge credit facility were $250 million and were fully funded. On November 3, 2006, MetroPCS IV, Inc. repaid the aggregate outstanding principal balance under the unsecured bridge credit facility of $250.0 million and accrued interest of $1.2 million. As a result, MetroPCS IV, Inc. recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $2.4 million. Senior Secured Credit Facility MetroPCS Wireless, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MetroPCS Communications, Inc., entered into the Senior Secured Credit Facility on November 3, 2006, or senior secured credit facility. The senior secured credit facility consists of a $1.6 billion term loan facility and a $100 million revolving credit facility. The term loan facility is repayable in quarterly installments in annual aggregate amounts equal to 1% of the initial aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion. The term loan facility will mature seven years following the date of its execution in November 2006. The revolving credit facility will mature five years following the date of its execution in November 2006. The facilities under the senior secured credit agreement are guaranteed by MetroPCS Communications, Inc., MetroPCS, Inc. and each of MetroPCS Wireless, Inc.’s direct and indirect present and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. The facilities are not guaranteed by Royal Street or its subsidiaries, but MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. has pledged the promissory note given by Royal Street in connection with amounts borrowed by Royal Street from MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. and we pledged the limited liability company member interests we hold in Royal Street. The senior secured credit facility contains customary events of default, including cross defaults. The obligations are also secured by the capital stock of MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. as well as substantially all of the present and future assets of MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. and each of its direct and indirect present and future wholly-owned subsidiaries (except as prohibited by law and certain permitted exceptions). Under the senior secured credit agreement, MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. will be subject to certain limitations, including limitations on its ability to incur additional debt, make certain restricted payments, sell assets, make certain investments or acquisitions, grant liens and pay dividends. MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. is also subject to certain financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum senior secured consolidated leverage ratio and, under certain circumstances, maximum consolidated leverage and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios. There is no prohibition on our ability to make investments in or loan money to Royal Street. Amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facility bear interest at a LIBOR rate plus a margin as set forth in the facility and the terms of the senior secured credit facility require us to enter into interest rate hedging agreements that fix the interest rate in an amount equal to at least 50% of our outstanding indebtedness, including the notes. On November 21, 2006, MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. entered into a three-year interest rate protection agreement to manage its interest rate risk exposure and fulfill a requirement of its senior secured credit facility. The agreement covers a notional amount of $1.0 billion and effectively converts this portion of MetroPCS Wireless, Inc.’s variable rate debt to fixed-rate debt at an annual rate of 7.169%. The quarterly interest settlement periods began on February 1, 2007. The interest rate protection agreement expires on February 1, 2010. On February 20, 2007, MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. entered into an amendment to the senior secured credit facility. Under the amendment, the margin used to determine the senior secured credit facility interest rate was reduced to 2.25% from 2.50%. 78 Table of Contents 91/4% Senior Notes Due 2014 On November 3, 2006, MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. consummated the sale of $1.0 billion principal amount of its initial senior notes. On June 6, 2007, MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. consummated the sale of an additional $400 million principal amount of additional notes. The initial senior notes and the additional notes are referred to together as the 91/4% senior notes. The 91/4% senior notes are unsecured obligations and are guaranteed by MetroPCS Communications, Inc., MetroPCS, Inc., and all of MetroPCS Wireless, Inc.’s direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, but are not guaranteed by Royal Street Communications or its subsidiaries. Interest is payable on the initial senior notes on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning with May 1, 2007, with respect to the initial senior notes, and beginning on November 1, 2007 with respect to the additional notes. MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 91/4% senior notes at any time on or after November 1, 2010 for the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 91/4% senior notes. In addition, MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 91/4% senior notes with the net cash proceeds of certain sales of equity securities, including the sale of common stock. Capital Expenditures and Other Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions Capital Expenditures. We and Royal Street currently expect to incur capital expenditures in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the year ending December 31, 2008 in our Core and Expansion Markets, which includes $600 million to $700 million in our Auction 66 markets. In addition, we have committed or expect to commit to spend in the first half of 2008 an aggregate of between $360 million and $375 million in cash to acquire assets to support our networks in existing markets or markets we are building, including assets related to the acquisition of, conversion of, buildout of, and launch of service in, Jacksonville, Florida. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we and Royal Street incurred $767.7 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion and improvement of our existing network infrastructure and costs associated with the construction of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, which was launched in September 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we had $550.7 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion and improvement of our existing network infrastructure and costs associated with the construction of the Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit and Orlando Expansion Markets that we launched in 2006, as well as the construction of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we had $266.5 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion and improvement of our existing network infrastructure and costs associated with the construction of the Tampa/Sarasota, Dallas/Ft. Worth and Detroit metropolitan areas. Other Acquisitions and Dispositions. On May 11, 2005, we completed the sale of a 10 MHz portion of our 30 MHz PCS license in the San Francisco — Oakland — San Jose basic trading area for cash consideration of $230.0 million. The sale was structured as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, through which our right, title and interest in and to the divested PCS spectrum was exchanged for the PCS spectrum acquired in Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas and Detroit, Michigan through a license purchase agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $230.0 million. The purchase of the PCS spectrum in Dallas/Ft. Worth and Detroit was accomplished in two steps with the first step of the exchange occurring on February 23, 2005 and the second step occurring on May 11, 2005 when we consummated the sale of 10 MHz of PCS spectrum for the San Francisco — Oakland — San Jose basic trading area. The sale of PCS spectrum resulted in a gain on disposal of asset in the amount of $228.2 million. On July 7, 2005, we acquired a 10 MHz F-Block PCS license for Grayson and Fannin counties in the basic trading area of Sherman-Denison, Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $0.9 million. On August 12, 2005, we closed on the purchase of a 10 MHz F-Block PCS license in the basic trading area of Bakersfield, California for an aggregate purchase price of $4.0 million. On December 21, 2005, the FCC granted Royal Street 10 MHz of PCS spectrum in each of the Los Angeles, California; Orlando, Lakeland-Winter Haven, Jacksonville, Melbourne-Titusville, and Gainesville, Florida basic trading areas. Royal Street, as the high bidder in Auction 58, had paid approximately $294.0 million to the FCC for these PCS licenses. 79 Table of Contents On August 7, 2006, we acquired a 10 MHz PCS license in the basic trading area of Ocala, Florida in exchange for a 10 MHz portion of our 30 MHz PCS license in the basic trading area of Athens, Georgia. We paid $0.2 million at the closing of this agreement. On November 29, 2006, we were granted AWS licenses as a result of FCC Auction 66, for a total aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion. These new licenses cover six of the 25 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. The east coast expansion opportunities include, but are not limited to, the entire east coast corridor from Philadelphia to Boston, including New York City, as well as the entire states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts. In the western United States, the new expansion opportunities include the San Diego, Portland, Seattle and Las Vegas metropolitan areas. The balance supplements or expands the geographic boundaries of our existing operations in Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table provides aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007. See Note 10 to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Payments Due by Period Less More Than Than Total 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt, including current portion $ 2,980,000 $ 16,000 $ 32,000 $ 32,000 $ 2,900,000 Interest expense on long-term debt(1) 1,560,405 245,298 490,596 490,596 333,915 Alcatel Lucent purchase commitment 30,000 30,000 — — — Contractual tax obligations (2) 2,773 2,773 — — — Operating leases 1,045,160 126,330 260,291 241,342 417,197 Total cash contractual obligations $ 5,618,338 $ 420,401 $ 782,887 $ 763,938 $ 3,651,112 (1) Interest expense on long-term debt includes future interest payments on outstanding obligations under our senior secured credit facility and 9 1/4% senior notes. The senior secured credit facility bears interest at a floating rate tied to a fixed spread to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate. The interest expense presented in this table is based on the rates at December 31, 2007 which was 7.329% for the senior secured credit facility. (2) Represents the liability reported in accordance with the Company’s adoption of the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, other than the items included in the table above, the Company was unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these remaining liabilities might be paid. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $19.3 million as of December 31, 2007, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 16, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Inflation We believe that inflation has not materially affected our operations. Effect of New Accounting Standards In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” (“SFAS No. 157”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. However, in February 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-6 which delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The FSP partially defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this FSP. The Company will be required to adopt SFAS No. 157 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in FSP FAS 157-6. The partial adoption of SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 80 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115,” (“SFAS No. 159”), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective of SFAS No. 159 is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company will be required to adopt SFAS No. 159 on January 1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations,” (“SFAS No. 141(R)”), which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and early adoption is prohibited. We have not yet determined the effect on our consolidated financial statements, if any, upon adoption of SFAS No. 141(R). In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements,” (“SFAS No. 160”), which establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent’s ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and early adoption is prohibited. We have not yet determined the effect on our consolidated financial statements, if any, upon adoption of SFAS No. 160. Michigan Business Tax On July 12, 2007, the Michigan Governor signed into law a new Michigan Business Tax (“MBT Act”) which restructures the state business tax by replacing the Michigan Single Business Tax with a new two-part tax on business income and modified gross receipts, collectively referred to as the (“BIT/GRT tax”). On September 30, 2007, the Michigan Governor signed into law a BIT/GRT tax future deduction which is intended to offset the increased deferred tax liability and expense associated with the MBT Act. Because the main provision of the BIT/GRT tax imposes a two-part tax on business income and modified gross receipts, we believe the BIT/GRT tax and related future deduction should be accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 109 regarding the recognition of deferred taxes. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law should be included in tax expense attributable to continuing operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Although the effective date of the MBT Act is January 1, 2008, certain effects of the change should be reflected in the financial statements of the first interim or annual reporting period that includes July 12 and September 30, 2007. We have recorded a deferred tax liability and offsetting asset of $4.4 million as of December 31, 2007 relating to the MBT Act and future deduction. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, including interest rates. We do not routinely enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading, speculative or hedging purposes, unless it is required by our senior secured credit facility. We do not currently conduct business internationally, so we are generally not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $1.6 billion in outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility that bears interest at floating rates based on the London Inter Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.25%. The interest rate on the outstanding debt under our senior secured credit facility as of December 31, 2007 was 7.329%. On November 21, 2006, to manage our interest rate risk exposure and fulfill a requirement of our senior secured credit facility, we entered into a three-year interest rate protection agreement. This agreement covers a notional amount of $1.0 billion and effectively converts this portion of our variable rate debt to fixed-rate debt at an annual rate of 7.169%. The quarterly interest settlement periods began on February 1, 2007. The interest rate swap agreement expires in 2010. If market LIBOR rates increase 100 basis points over the rates in effect at 81 Table of Contents December 31, 2007, annual interest expense on the approximately $580.0 million in variable rate debt would increase approximately $5.8 million.",2023-12-30 17:44:05.097077

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Company Overview Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are those of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. and Royal Street Communications, LLC. References to “MetroPCS,” “MetroPCS Communications,” “our Company,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer to MetroPCS Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Unless otherwise indicated, all share numbers and per share prices give effect to a 3 for 1 stock split effected by means of a stock dividend of two shares of common stock for each share of common stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on March 14, 2007. On April 18, 2007, the registration statement for our initial public offering became effective and our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “PCS” on April 19, 2007. We consummated our initial public offering of our common stock on April 24, 2007. We are a wireless telecommunications carrier that currently offers wireless services primarily in the greater Atlanta, Boston, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Orlando/Jacksonville, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Sacramento and Tampa/Sarasota metropolitan areas. We launched service in the greater Atlanta, Miami and Sacramento metropolitan areas in the first quarter of 2002; in San Francisco in September 2002; in Tampa/Sarasota in October 2005; in Dallas/Ft. Worth in March 2006; in Detroit in April 2006; in Orlando in November 2006; in Los Angeles in September 2007; in Las Vegas in March 2008; in Jacksonville in April 2008; in Philadelphia in July 2008; and in New York and Boston in February 2009. In 2005, Royal Street Communications, LLC, or Royal Street Communications, and with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, or collectively, Royal Street, was granted licenses by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, in Los Angeles and various metropolitan areas throughout northern Florida. We own 85% of the limited liability company member interests in Royal Street Communications, but may only elect two of the five members of Royal Street Communications’ management committee. We have a wholesale arrangement with Royal Street under which we purchase up to 85% of the engineered capacity of Royal Street’s systems allowing us to sell our standard products and services under the MetroPCS brand to the public. Royal Street has constructed, or is in the process of constructing, its network infrastructure in its licensed metropolitan areas. We commenced commercial services in Orlando and certain portions of northern Florida in November 2006 and in Los Angeles in September 2007 through our arrangements with Royal Street. Additionally, upon Royal Street’s request, we have provided and will provide financing to Royal Street under a loan agreement. As of December 31, 2008, the maximum amount that Royal Street could borrow from us under the loan agreement was approximately $1.0 billion of which Royal Street had net outstanding borrowings of $905.0 million through December 31, 2008. On February 17, 2009, we executed an amendment to the loan agreement which increased the amount available to Royal Street under the loan agreement by an additional $550.0 million. Royal Street has incurred an additional $14.2 million in net borrowings through February 23, 2009. As a result of the significant growth we have experienced since we launched operations, our results of operations to date are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected in future periods. Moreover, we expect that our number of customers will continue to increase, which will continue to contribute to increases in our revenues and operating expenses. We currently plan to focus on building out networks to cover approximately 40 million of total population during 2009-2010 including the launch of the Boston and New York metropolitan areas in February 2009. We sell products and services to customers through our Company-owned retail stores as well as indirectly through relationships with independent retailers. We offer service which allows our customers to place unlimited local calls from within our local service area and to receive unlimited calls from any area while in our local service area, under simple and affordable flat monthly rate service plans starting at $30 per month. For an additional $5 to $20 per month, our customers may select a service plan that offers additional services, such as unlimited voicemail, caller ID, call waiting, enhanced directory assistance, unlimited text messaging, mobile Internet browsing, push e-mail, social networking services, location based services, mobile instant messaging, picture and multimedia messaging and the ability to place unlimited long distance calls from within our local service calling area to any number in the continental United States. We offer flat-rate monthly plans at $30, $35, $40, $45 and $50, as well as Family Plans which offer discounts to our monthly plans for multiple lines. All of these plans require payment in advance for one month of service. If no payment is made in advance for the following month of service, service is suspended at the end of the month that was paid for by the customer and terminated if the customer does not pay within thirty days. For additional fees, we also provide international long distance and international text messaging, 52 Table of Contents ringtones, ring back tones, downloads, games and content applications, unlimited directory assistance, location services and other value-added services. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 80% of our customers have selected a $40 or higher rate plan. Our flat-rate plans differentiate our service from the more complex plans and long-term contract requirements of traditional wireless carriers. In addition, the above products and services are offered by us in the Royal Street markets under the MetroPCS brand. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates On January 1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” or SFAS No. 157, for financial assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, thereby eliminating inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements, and increases disclosures surrounding fair value calculations. SFAS No. 157 establishes a three-tiered fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. SFAS No. 157 requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. You should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Our wireless services are provided on a month-to-month basis and are paid in advance. We recognize revenues from wireless services as they are rendered. Amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Suspending service for non-payment is known as hotlining. We do not recognize revenue on hotlined customers. Revenues and related costs from the sale of accessories are recognized at the point of sale. The cost of handsets sold to indirect retailers are included in deferred charges until they are sold to and activated by customers. Amounts billed to indirect retailers for handsets are recorded as accounts receivable and deferred revenue upon shipment by us and are recognized as equipment revenues when service is activated by customers. Our customers have the right to return handsets within a specified time or within a certain amount of use, whichever occurs first. We record an estimate for returns as contra-revenue at the time of recognizing revenue. Our assessment of estimated returns is based on historical return rates. If our customers’ actual returns are not consistent with our estimates of their returns, revenues may be different than initially recorded. We follow the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force or EITF, No. 00-21, “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” or EITF No. 00-21. EITF No. 00-21, addresses the accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting and the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the residual method of accounting. We determined that the sale of wireless services through our direct and indirect sales channels with an accompanying handset constitutes revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. In accordance with EITF No. 00-21, we divide these arrangements into separate units of accounting and allocate the consideration between the handset and the wireless service using the residual method of accounting. Consideration received for the wireless service is recognized at fair value as service revenue when earned, and any remaining consideration received is recognized as equipment revenue when the handset is delivered and accepted by the customer. 53 Table of Contents Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our independent retailers to pay for equipment purchases and for amounts estimated to be uncollectible for intercarrier compensation. We estimate allowances for uncollectible accounts from independent retailers based on the length of time the receivables are past due, the current business environment and our historical experience. If the financial condition of a material portion of our independent retailers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific carrier’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record a specific allowance for intercarrier compensation against amounts due; to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. Total allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable as of December 31, 2008 was approximately 12% of the total amount of gross accounts receivable. Inventories We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value or replacement cost based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Total inventory reserves for obsolescent and unmarketable inventory were not significant as of December 31, 2008. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Deferred Income Tax Asset and Other Tax Reserves We assess our deferred tax asset and record a valuation allowance, when necessary, to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future taxable income, taxable temporary differences and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period we made that determination. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax returns are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and ultimately modified. We adjust the reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of income tax related reserve positions and changes to income tax reserves that we consider appropriate. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is finally resolved. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash or a reduction in our net operating loss carryforwards. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the effective rate in the year of resolution. Tax reserves as of December 31, 2008 were $37.6 million of which $5.2 million and $32.4 million are presented on the consolidated balance sheet in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. On January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” or FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures, and transition. FIN 48 requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. Changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently, affect our operating results. Property and Equipment Depreciation on property and equipment is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service, which are seven to ten years for network infrastructure assets, three to ten years for capitalized interest, three to seven years for office equipment, which includes computer equipment, three to seven years for furniture and fixtures and five years for vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease and any renewal periods reasonably assured or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. The estimated life of property and equipment is based on historical experience with similar assets, as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. If technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased 54 Table of Contents depreciation expense in future periods. Likewise, if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than anticipated, the life of the assets could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to property and equipment. This could result in a reduction of depreciation expense in future periods. We assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or in the strategy for our overall business. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. When we determine that the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, we measure any impairment based upon a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate we determine to be commensurate with the risk involved and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge associated with long-lived assets. The carrying value of property and equipment was approximately $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2008. Long-Term Investments We account for our investment securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” At December 31, 2008, all of the Company’s long-term investment securities were reported at fair value. Due to the lack of availability of observable market quotes on our investment portfolio of auction rate securities, the fair value was estimated based on valuation models that rely exclusively on unobservable inputs including those that are based on expected cash flow streams and collateral values, including assessments of counterparty credit quality, default risk underlying the security, discount rates and overall capital market liquidity. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Declines in fair value that are considered other-than-temporary are charged to earnings and those that are considered temporary are reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. The Company has recorded an impairment charge of $30.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, reflecting the portion of the auction rate security holdings that the Company has concluded have an other-than-temporary decline in value. The valuation of the Company’s investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Factors that may impact the Company’s valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral values, discount rates, counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity. The estimated market value of the Company’s auction rate security holdings at December 31, 2008 was approximately $6.0 million. With the continuing liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets, the auction rate securities held by the Company at December 31, 2008 continued to experience failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale in the auctions exceeded the amount of purchase orders. In addition, all of the auction rate securities held by the Company have been downgraded or placed on credit watch. The Company may incur additional impairments to its auction rate securities which may be up to the full remaining value of such auction rate securities. FCC Licenses and Microwave Relocation Costs We operate wireless broadband mobile networks under licenses granted by the FCC for a particular geographic area on spectrum allocated by the FCC for terrestrial wireless broadband mobile services. In November 2006, we acquired a number of AWS licenses which can be used to provide wireless broadband mobile services comparable to the PCS services provided by us, as well as other advanced wireless services. In June 2008, we acquired a 700 MHz license that also can be used to provide similar services. The PCS licenses previously included, and the AWS licenses currently include, the obligation to relocate existing fixed microwave users of our licensed spectrum if the use of our spectrum interfered with their systems and/or reimburse other carriers (according to FCC rules) that relocated prior users if the relocation benefits our system. Additionally, we incurred costs related to microwave relocation in constructing our PCS and AWS networks. The PCS, AWS and 700 MHz licenses and microwave relocation costs are recorded at cost. Although FCC licenses are issued with a stated term, ten years in the case of PCS licenses, fifteen years in the case of AWS licenses and approximately 10.5 years for 700 MHz licenses, the 55 Table of Contents renewal of PCS, AWS and 700 MHz licenses is generally a routine matter without substantial cost and we have determined that no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors currently exist that limit the useful life of our PCS, AWS and 700 MHz licenses. The carrying value of FCC licenses and microwave relocation costs was approximately $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2008. Our primary indefinite-lived intangible assets are our FCC licenses. Based on the requirements of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and other Intangible Assets,”or SFAS No. 142, we test investments in our FCC licenses for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our FCC licenses might be impaired. We perform our annual FCC license impairment test as of each September 30th. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value with the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our FCC licenses using a discounted cash flow model. Cash flow projections and assumptions, although subject to a degree of uncertainty, are based on a combination of our historical performance and trends, our business plans and management’s estimate of future performance, giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive economic conditions. Other assumptions include our weighted average cost of capital and long-term rate of growth for our business. We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use to estimate fair value. We corroborate our determination of fair value of the FCC licenses, using the discounted cash flow approach described above, with other market-based valuation metrics. Furthermore, we segregate our FCC licenses by regional clusters for the purpose of performing the impairment test because each geographical region is unique. An impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related indefinite-lived intangible asset and charged to results of operations. Historically, we have not experienced significant negative variations between our assumptions and estimates when compared to actual results. However, if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge associated with indefinite-lived intangible assets. Although we do not expect our estimates or assumptions to change significantly in the future, the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our FCC licenses or using a methodology other than a discounted cash flow model could result in different values for our FCC licenses and may affect any related impairment charge. The most significant assumptions within our discounted cash flow model are the discount rate, our projected growth rate and management’s future business plans. A change in management’s future business plans or disposition of one or more FCC licenses could result in the requirement to test certain other FCC licenses. If any legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors were to limit the useful lives of our indefinite-lived FCC licenses, we would be required to test these intangible assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142 and amortize the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. For the license impairment test performed as of September 30, 2008, the fair value of the FCC licenses was in excess of their carrying value. There have been no indicators of impairment and no impairment has been recognized through December 31, 2008. Share-Based Payments We account for share-based awards exchanged for employee services in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” or SFAS No. 123(R). Under SFAS No. 123(R), share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. We have granted nonqualified stock options. Most of our stock option awards include a service condition that relates only to vesting. The stock option awards generally vest in one to four years from the grant date. Compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award. The determination of the fair value of stock options using an option-pricing model is affected by our common stock valuation as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. Prior to our initial public offering, factors that our Board of Directors considered in determining the fair market value of our common stock, included the recommendation of our finance and planning committee and of management based on certain data, including discounted cash flow analysis, comparable company analysis and comparable transaction analysis, as well as contemporaneous valuation reports. After our initial public offering, the Board of Directors uses the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant as the fair market value for our common stock. The volatility assumption is based on a combination of the historical volatility of our common stock and the volatilities of similar companies over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock options. The volatilities of similar companies are used in conjunction with our historical volatility because of the lack of sufficient relevant history equal to the expected term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the 56 Table of Contents stock options are expected to remain outstanding. The expected term assumption is estimated based primarily on the stock options’ vesting terms and remaining contractual life and employees’ expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on the grant date appropriate for the term of the employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the expectation of no future dividend payouts by us. As share-based compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R) is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it is reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We recognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $41.1 million, $28.0 million and $14.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The value of the options is determined by using a Black-Scholes pricing model that includes the following variables: 1) exercise price of the instrument, 2) fair market value of the underlying stock on date of grant, 3) expected life, 4) estimated volatility and 5) the risk-free interest rate. We utilized the following weighted-average assumptions in estimating the fair value of the options grants for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: December 31, December 31, 2008 2007 Expected dividends 0.00 % 0.00 % Expected volatility 45.20 % 42.69 % Risk-free interest rate 2.49 % 4.54 % Expected lives in years 5.00 5.00 Weighted-average fair value of options: Granted at below fair value $ — $ — Granted at fair value $ 6.95 $ 9.89 Weighted-average exercise price of options: Granted at below fair value $ — $ — Granted at fair value $ 16.36 $ 22.41 The Black-Scholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions including expectations of future dividends and stock price volatility. Such assumptions are only used for making the required fair value estimate and should not be considered as indicators of future dividend policy or stock price appreciation. Because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, and because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, the use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model may not provide a reliable estimate of the fair value of employee stock options. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award. Customer Recognition and Disconnect Policies When a new customer subscribes to our service, the first month of service is included with the handset purchase. Under GAAP, we are required to allocate the purchase price to the handset and to the wireless service revenue. Generally, the amount allocated to the handset will be less than our cost, and this difference is included in Cost Per Gross Addition, or CPGA. We recognize new customers as gross customer additions upon activation of service. We offer our customers the Metro Promise, which allows a customer to return a newly purchased handset for a full refund prior to the earlier of 30 days or 60 minutes of use. Customers who return their phones under the Metro Promise are reflected as a reduction to gross customer additions. Customers’ monthly service payments are due in advance every month. Our customers must pay their monthly service amount by the payment date or their service will be suspended, or hotlined, and the customer will not be able to make or receive calls on our network. However, a hotlined customer is still able to make E-911 calls in the event of an emergency. There is no service grace period. Any call attempted by a hotlined customer is routed directly to our interactive voice response system and customer service center in order to arrange payment. If the customer pays the amount due within 30 days of the original payment date then the customer’s service is restored. If a hotlined customer does not pay the amount due within 30 days of the payment date the account is disconnected and counted as churn. Once an account is disconnected we charge a $15 reconnect fee upon reactivation to reestablish service and the revenue associated with this fee is deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the customer. 57 Table of Contents Revenues We derive our revenues from the following sources: Service. We sell wireless broadband mobile services. The various types of service revenues associated with wireless broadband mobile for our customers include monthly recurring charges for airtime, monthly recurring charges for optional features (including nationwide long distance, unlimited text messaging, international text messaging, voicemail, downloads, ringtones, games and content applications, unlimited directory assistance, enhanced directory assistance, ring back tones, mobile Internet browsing, mobile instant messaging, push e-mail and nationwide roaming) and charges for long distance service. Service revenues also include intercarrier compensation and nonrecurring reactivation service charges to customers. Equipment. We sell wireless broadband mobile handsets and accessories that are used by our customers in connection with our wireless services. This equipment is also sold to our independent retailers to facilitate distribution to our customers. Costs and Expenses Our costs and expenses include: Cost of Service. The major components of our cost of service are: • Cell Site Costs. We incur expenses for the rent of cell sites, network facilities, engineering operations, field technicians and related utility and maintenance charges. • Intercarrier Compensation. We pay charges to other telecommunications companies for their transport and termination of calls originated by our customers and destined for customers of other networks. These variable charges are based on our customers’ usage and generally applied at pre-negotiated rates with other carriers, although some carriers have sought to impose such charges unilaterally. • Variable Long Distance. We pay charges to other telecommunications companies for long distance service provided to our customers. These variable charges are based on our customers’ usage, applied at pre-negotiated rates with the long distance carriers. Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment primarily includes the cost of handsets and accessories purchased from third-party vendors to resell to our customers and independent retailers in connection with our services. We do not manufacture any of this equipment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling expenses include advertising and promotional costs associated with marketing and selling to new customers and fixed charges such as retail store rent and retail associates’ salaries. General and administrative expenses include support functions including, technical operations, finance, accounting, human resources, information technology and legal services. We record stock-based compensation expense in cost of service and in selling, general and administrative expenses for expense associated with employee stock options, which is measured at the date of grant, based on the estimated fair value of the award. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service, which are seven to ten years for network infrastructure assets, three to ten years for capitalized interest, three to seven years for office equipment, which includes computer equipment, three to seven years for furniture and fixtures and five years for vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the respective leases, which includes renewal periods that are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense includes interest incurred on our borrowings, amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of discounts and premiums on long-term debt. Interest income is earned primarily on our cash and cash equivalents. 58 Table of Contents Income Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we paid no federal income taxes, whereas for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we paid approximately $0.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively, in federal income taxes. In addition, we have paid $2.7 million, $1.1 million and an immaterial amount of state income tax during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Seasonality Our customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. Based on historical results, we generally expect net customer additions to be strongest in the first and fourth quarters. Softening of sales and increased customer turnover, or churn, in the second and third quarters of the year usually combine to result in fewer net customer additions. However, sales activity and churn can be strongly affected by the launch of new and surrounding metropolitan areas and promotional activity, which could reduce or outweigh certain seasonal effects.

Our chief operating decision maker is the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. As of December 31, 2008, we had thirteen operating segments based on geographic region within the United States: Atlanta, Boston, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Orlando/Jacksonville, Philadelphia, Sacramento, San Francisco, and Tampa/Sarasota. Each of these operating segments provide wireless broadband mobile voice and data services and products to customers in its service areas or is currently constructing a network in order to provide these services. These services include unlimited local and long distance calling, voicemail, caller ID, call waiting, enhanced directory assistance, text messaging, picture and multimedia messaging, domestic and international long distance, international text messaging, ringtones, games and content applications, unlimited directory assistance, ring back tones, nationwide roaming, mobile Internet browsing, mobile instant messaging, push e-mail, location based services, social networking services and other value-added services. We aggregate our operating segments into two reportable segments: Core Markets and Expansion Markets. • Core Markets, which include Atlanta, Miami, Sacramento and San Francisco, are aggregated because they are reviewed on an aggregate basis by the chief operating decision maker, they are similar in respect to their products and services, production processes, class of customer, method of distribution, and regulatory environment and currently exhibit similar financial performance and economic characteristics. • Expansion Markets, which include Boston, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York, Orlando/Jacksonville, Philadelphia, and Tampa/Sarasota are aggregated because they are reviewed on an aggregate basis by the chief operating decision maker, they are similar in respect to their products and services, production processes, class of customer, method of distribution, and regulatory environment and have similar expected long-term financial performance and economic characteristics. 59 Table of Contents General corporate overhead, which includes expenses such as corporate employee labor costs, rent and utilities, legal, accounting and auditing expenses, is allocated equally across all operating segments. Corporate marketing and advertising expenses are allocated equally to the operating segments, beginning in the period during which we launch service in that operating segment. Expenses associated with our national data center and national operations center are allocated based on the average number of customers in each operating segment. There are no transactions between reportable segments. Interest and certain other expenses, interest income and income taxes are not allocated to the segments in the computation of segment operating profit for internal evaluation purposes. 60 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Set forth below is a summary of certain financial information by reportable operating segment for the periods indicated: Reportable Operating Segment Data 2008 2007 Change (in thousands) REVENUES: Service revenues: Core Markets $ 1,504,870 $ 1,414,917 6 % Expansion Markets 932,380 504,280 85 % Total $ 2,437,250 $ 1,919,197 27 % Equipment revenues: Core Markets $ 186,263 $ 220,364 (15 )% Expansion Markets 128,003 96,173 33 % Total $ 314,266 $ 316,537 (1 )% OPERATING EXPENSES: Cost of service (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below) (1): Core Markets $ 437,765 $ 439,162 0 % Expansion Markets 419,530 208,348 101 % Total $ 857,295 $ 647,510 32 % Cost of equipment: Core Markets $ 374,777 $ 385,100 (3 )% Expansion Markets 329,871 212,133 56 % Total $ 704,648 $ 597,233 18 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below) (1): Core Markets $ 171,819 $ 167,542 3 % Expansion Markets 275,763 184,478 50 % Total $ 447,582 $ 352,020 27 % Adjusted EBITDA (2): Core Markets $ 720,334 $ 654,112 10 % Expansion Markets 62,799 12,883 387 % Depreciation and amortization: Core Markets $ 130,695 $ 117,344 11 % Expansion Markets 106,410 53,851 98 % Other 18,214 7,007 160 % Total $ 255,319 $ 178,202 43 % Stock-based compensation expense: Core Markets $ 13,562 $ 10,635 28 % Expansion Markets 27,580 17,389 59 % Total $ 41,142 $ 28,024 47 % Income (loss) from operations: Core Markets $ 557,425 $ 529,194 5 % Expansion Markets (71,440 ) (58,818 ) 21 % Other (18,218 ) (10,262 ) 78 % Total $ 467,767 $ 460,114 2 % (1) Cost of service and selling, general and administrative expenses include stock-based compensation expense.

Service revenues increased $518.1 million, or approximately 27%, to $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is due to increases in Core Markets and Expansion Markets service revenues as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets service revenues increased $90.0 million, or 6%, to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in service revenues is primarily attributable to net customer additions of approximately 328,000 customers for the year ended December 31, 2008, which accounted for approximately $157.3 million of the Core Markets increase. This increase was partially offset by the higher participation in our Family Plans as well as reduced revenue from certain features included in our service plans that were previously provided a la carte, accounting for an approximately $56.2 million decrease. In addition, consolidated pass through charges revenue increased $40.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. This increase is primarily attributable to a 35% increase in our consolidated customer base since December 31, 2007 and higher federal universal service fund, or FUSF, rates. Beginning on January 1, 2008, a portion of these revenues were allocated to the Expansion Markets in the amount of $52.2 million resulting in a net decrease of $11.3 million in the Core Markets for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. • Expansion Markets. Expansion Markets service revenues increased $428.1 million, or approximately 85%, to $932.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $504.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in service revenues is primarily attributable to net customer additions of approximately 1.1 million customers for the year ended December 31, 2008, which accounted for approximately $417.4 million of the Expansion Markets increase. This increase was partially offset by the higher participation in our Family Plans as well as reduced revenue from certain features included in our service plans that were previously provided a la carte, accounting for an approximately $46.3 million decrease. In addition, pass through charges revenue increased $52.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 due to the allocation of a portion of these revenues to the Expansion Markets beginning on January 1, 2008. Equipment Revenues. Equipment revenues decreased $2.3 million, or approximately 1%, to $314.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $316.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease is due primarily to a decrease in Core Markets equipment revenues, partially offset by an increase in Expansion Markets equipment revenues as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets equipment revenues decreased $34.1 million, or 15%, to $186.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $220.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in equipment revenues is primarily attributable to a lower average price of handsets activated reducing equipment revenues by $36.4 million, partially offset by an increase in upgrade handset sales to existing customers accounting for a $1.7 million increase in equipment revenues. • Expansion Markets. Expansion Markets equipment revenues increased $31.8 million, or 33%, to $128.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in equipment revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in gross customer additions which accounted for $31.1 million of the Expansion Markets increase, coupled with an increase in upgrade handset sales to existing customers accounting for a $26.0 million increase. These increases in equipment revenues were partially offset by a lower average price of handsets activated which accounted for a $28.2 million decrease. Cost of Service. Cost of service increased $209.8 million, or approximately 32%, to $857.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $647.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is due primarily to an increase in Expansion Markets cost of service, partially offset by a decrease in Core Markets cost of service as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets cost of service decreased $1.4 million to $437.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $439.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Core Markets cost of service (excluding pass through charges) increased $13.6 million, or 4%, to $353.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $339.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to the 12% growth in our Core Markets customer base and the deployment of additional network infrastructure during the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. In addition, consolidated pass through 62 Table of Contents charges increased $37.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. This increase is primarily attributable to a 35% increase in our consolidated customer base since December 31, 2007 and higher FUSF rates. On January 1, 2008, we began allocating a portion of these expenses to the Expansion Markets. The portion of the pass through charges that were allocated to the Expansion Markets during the year ended December 31, 2008 was $52.1 million, resulting in a net decrease of $15.0 million in the Core Markets for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared to the same period in 2007. • Expansion Markets. Expansion Markets cost of service increased $211.2 million, or 101%, to $419.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $208.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Expansion Markets cost of service (excluding pass through charges) increased $159.1 million, or approximately 77%, to $364.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $205.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to the approximately 83% growth in our Expansion Markets customer base, coupled with expenses associated with the launch of service in new markets well as the build-out expenses related to the New York and Boston metropolitan areas. In addition, pass through charges increased approximately $52.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 due to the allocation of a portion of these expenses to the Expansion Markets beginning on January 1, 2008. Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment increased $107.4 million, or 18%, to $704.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $597.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is due primarily to an increase in Expansion Markets cost of equipment, partially offset by a decrease in Core Markets cost of equipment as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets cost of equipment decreased $10.3 million, or approximately 3%, to $374.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $385.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in Core Markets cost of equipment is primarily attributable to a lower average cost of handsets activated reducing cost of equipment by $15.3 million, partially offset by an increase in upgrade handset sales to existing customer accounting for a $2.1 million increase. • Expansion Markets. Expansion Markets cost of equipment increased $117.7 million, or approximately 56%, to $329.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $212.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in Expansion Markets cost of equipment is primarily attributable to an increase in gross customer additions which accounted for $87.4 million, coupled with an increase in upgrade handset sales to existing customers accounting for $37.0 million. These increases were partially offset by a lower average cost of handsets sales reducing cost of equipment by $12.5 million. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $95.6 million, or 27%, to $447.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $352.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is due to increases in Core Markets and Expansion Markets selling, general and administrative expenses as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.3 million, or approximately 3%, to $171.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $167.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Selling expenses increased by $5.2 million, or approximately 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in selling expenses is primarily attributable to a $2.9 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses as well as higher employee related costs of $3.3 million incurred to support the growth in the Core Markets. General and administrative expenses decreased by $3.4 million, or 4% for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This was due primarily to a decrease in various administrative expenses incurred as a result of cost benefits achieved due to the increasing scale of our business in the Core Markets. In addition, stock-based compensation expense increased $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007. See — “Stock-Based Compensation Expense.” 63 Table of Contents • Expansion Markets. Expansion Markets selling, general and administrative expenses increased $91.3 million, or approximately 50%, to $275.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $184.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Selling expenses increased by $54.0 million, or 72%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase is primarily due to a $16.6 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses incurred to support the growth in the Expansion Markets as well as higher employee related costs of $17.6 million to support the growth and buildout of the Expansion Markets. General and administrative expenses increased by $27.7 million, or approximately 30%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily due to the approximately 83% growth in our Expansion Markets customer base, including the launch of service in new markets, as well as the build-out expenses related to the New York and Boston metropolitan areas. In addition, an increase of $10.2 million in stock-based compensation expense contributed to the increase in the Expansion Markets. See — “Stock-Based Compensation Expense.” Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $77.1 million, or 43%, to $255.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $178.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is primarily due to increases in Core Markets and Expansion Markets depreciation expense as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets depreciation and amortization expense increased $13.4 million, or 11%, to $130.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $117.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase related primarily to an increase in network infrastructure assets placed into service during the year ended December 31, 2008 to support the continued growth in the Core Markets. • Expansion Markets. Expansion Markets depreciation and amortization expense increased $52.5 million, or approximately 98%, to $106.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $53.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase related primarily to an increase in network infrastructure assets placed into service during the year ended December 31, 2008 driven primarily by the launch of service in new markets. Stock-Based Compensation Expense. Stock-based compensation expense increased $13.1 million, or approximately 47%, to $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is due primarily to increases in Core Markets and Expansion Markets stock-based compensation expense as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets stock-based compensation expense increased $2.9 million, or approximately 28%, to $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is primarily related to additional stock options granted to employees in these markets throughout the year ended December 31, 2008. • Expansion Markets. Expansion Markets stock-based compensation expense increased $10.2 million, or approximately 59%, to $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Loss on Disposal of Assets. Loss on disposal of assets increased $18.3 million to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a loss on disposal of assets related to certain network equipment and construction costs that were retired. The majority of the loss was related to the transfer of network switching equipment to a new location which resulted in the write-off of the associated construction and installation costs and certain other network equipment that had no future value to the new location. 64 Table of Contents Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $22.3 million, or 11%, to $179.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $201.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the capitalization of $64.2 million of interest during the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, compared to $34.9 million of interest capitalized during the same period in 2007. We capitalize interest costs associated with our FCC licenses and property and equipment during the construction of a new market. The amount of such capitalized interest depends on the carrying values of the FCC licenses and construction in progress involved in those markets and the duration of the construction process. We expect capitalized interest to be significant during the construction of new markets. In addition, our weighted average interest rate decreased to 7.78% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 compared to 8.15% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 as a result of a decrease in the borrowing rates under the senior secured credit facility. Average debt outstanding for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $3.0 and $2.8 billion, respectively. The increase in average debt outstanding was due to the issuance of an additional $400.0 million principal amount of our 91/4% senior notes in June 2007. Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income decreased $40.7 million, or approximately 64%, to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $63.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in interest and other income was primarily due to the Company investing substantially all of its cash and cash equivalents in money market funds consisting of U.S. treasury securities rather than in short-term investments as the Company has done historically. In addition, interest income decreased due to lower cash balances when compared to 2007 as well as a decrease on the return on our cash balances as a result of a decrease in interest rates. Impairment Loss on Investment Securities. We can and have historically invested our substantial cash balances in, among other things, securities issued and fully guaranteed by the United States or the states, highly rated commercial paper and auction rate securities, money market funds meeting certain criteria, and demand deposits. These investments are subject to credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we made an original investment of $133.9 million in principal in certain auction rate securities that were rated AAA/Aaa at the time of purchase, substantially all of which are secured by collateralized debt obligations with a portion of the underlying collateral being mortgage securities or related to mortgage securities. With the continued liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets, the auction rate securities held by us at December 31, 2008 continue to experience failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale in the auctions exceeds the amount of purchase orders. We recognized an additional other-than-temporary impairment loss on investment securities in the amount of $30.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense was $130.0 million and $123.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective tax rate was 46.5% and 54.4% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our effective rates differ from the statutory federal rate of 35.0% due to state and local taxes, non-deductible expenses and an increase in the valuation allowance related to the impairment loss recognized on investment securities. Net Income. Net income increased $49.0 million, or approximately 49%, to $149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in income from operations, a decrease in interest expense and a decrease in the impairment loss on investment securities. These items were partially offset by lower interest and other income for the year ended December 31, 2008. 65 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Set forth below is a summary of certain financial information by reportable operating segment for the periods indicated: Reportable Operating Segment Data 2007 2006 Change (in thousands) REVENUES: Service revenues: Core Markets $ 1,414,917 $ 1,138,019 24 % Expansion Markets 504,280 152,928 230 % Total $ 1,919,197 $ 1,290,947 49 % Equipment revenues: Core Markets $ 220,364 $ 208,333 6 % Expansion Markets 96,173 47,583 102 % Total $ 316,537 $ 255,916 24 % OPERATING EXPENSES: Cost of service (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below) (1): Core Markets $ 439,162 $ 338,923 30 % Expansion Markets 208,348 106,358 96 % Total $ 647,510 $ 445,281 45 % Cost of equipment: Core Markets $ 385,100 $ 364,281 6 % Expansion Markets 212,133 112,596 88 % Total $ 597,233 $ 476,877 25 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below)(1): Core Markets $ 167,542 $ 158,100 6 % Expansion Markets 184,478 85,518 116 % Total $ 352,020 $ 243,618 44 % Adjusted EBITDA (Deficit)(2): Core Markets $ 654,112 $ 492,773 33 % Expansion Markets 12,883 (97,214 ) 113 % Depreciation and amortization: Core Markets $ 117,344 $ 109,626 7 % Expansion Markets 53,851 21,941 145 % Other 7,007 3,461 102 % Total $ 178,202 $ 135,028 32 % Stock-based compensation expense: Core Markets $ 10,635 $ 7,725 38 % Expansion Markets 17,389 6,747 158 % Total $ 28,024 $ 14,472 94 % Income (loss) from operations: Core Markets $ 529,194 $ 367,109 44 % Expansion Markets (58,818 ) (126,387 ) 53 % Other (10,262 ) (3,469 ) 196 % Total $ 460,114 $ 237,253 94 % (1) Cost of service and selling, general and administrative expenses include stock-based compensation expense.

Service revenues increased $628.3 million, or 49%, to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is due to increases in Core Markets and Expansion Markets service revenues as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets service revenues increased $276.9 million, or 24%, to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in service revenues is primarily attributable to net additions of approximately 358,000 customers for the year ended December 31, 2007, which accounted for $213.2 million of the Core Markets increase, coupled with the migration of existing customers to higher priced rate plans accounting for $10.0 million of the Core Markets increase. In addition, pass through charges revenue increased approximately $53.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 primarily as a result of the increase in customers during the year ended December 31, 2007 and higher FUSF rates. • Expansion Markets. Expansion Markets service revenues increased $351.4 million, or 230%, to $504.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $152.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in service revenues is primarily attributable to net additions of approximately 664,000 customers for the year ended December 31, 2007, which accounted for $361.1 million of the Expansion Markets increase, partially offset by the migration of existing customers to lower priced rate plans accounting for a decrease of $9.7 million. Equipment Revenues. Equipment revenues increased $60.6 million, or 24%, to $316.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $255.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Core Markets equipment revenues increased $12.0 million, or 6%, to $220.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $208.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in Core Markets equipment revenues is attributable to an increase in gross additions of approximately 130,000 customers for the year ended December 31, 2007 offset by the sale of lower priced handsets, which accounted for $1.9 million of the Core Markets increase, as well as an increase in handset sales to existing customers accounting for $7.1 million of the Core Markets increase. • Expansion Markets. Expansion Markets equipment revenues increased $48.6 million, or 102%, to $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in Expansion Markets equipment revenues is attributable to an increase in gross additions of approximately 529,000 customers for the year ended December 31, 2007 offset by the sale of lower priced handsets, which accounted for $24.8 million of the Expansion Markets increase, as well as an increase in handset sales to existing customers accounting for $21.3 million of the Expansion Markets increase. Cost of Service. Cost of service increased $202.2 million, or 45%, to $647.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $445.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is due to increases in Core Markets and Expansion Markets cost of service as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets cost of service increased $100.2 million, or 30%, to $439.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $338.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Core Markets cost of service (excluding pass through charges) increased $46.3 million, or 16%, to $338.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $292.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is primarily attributable to the 16% growth in our Core Markets customer base and the deployment of additional network infrastructure during the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. In addition, pass through charges increased approximately $53.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 primarily as a result of the increase in customers during the year ended December 31, 2007 and higher FUSF rates. • Expansion Markets.

Consolidated Data 2007 2006 Change (in thousands) Loss on disposal of assets $ 655 $ 8,806 (93 )% Interest expense 201,746 115,985 74 % Loss on extinguishment of debt — 51,518 100 % Impairment loss on investment securities 97,800 — 100 % Provision for income taxes 123,098 36,717 235 % Net income 100,403 53,806 87 % Loss on Disposal of Assets. Loss on disposal of assets decreased $8.1 million, or approximately 93%, to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily as a result of a gain on disposal of assets from the sale of certain network infrastructure assets related to a change in network technology related to our cell sites in certain markets. The gain was offset by a $3.0 million loss on the termination of a lease agreement during the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2006, certain network technology related to our cell sites in certain markets was retired and replaced with new technology, resulting in a loss on disposal of assets. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $85.7 million, or 74%, to $201.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 from $116.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increased average principal balance outstanding as a result of borrowings of $1.6 billion under our senior secured credit facility and the issuance of $1.0 billion of 91/4% senior notes due 2014, or initial notes, during the fourth quarter of 2006. The Company also issued an additional $400.0 million of 91/4% senior notes, or additional notes, during the second quarter of 2007. The Company had average debt outstanding for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 of $2.8 billion. The average debt outstanding for the twelve months ending December 31, 2006 was $1.3 billion. The weighted average interest rate decreased to 8.15% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 compared to 10.30% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a decrease in the borrowing rates under the senior secured credit facility, issuance of the initial notes and the additional notes, collectively referred to as the 91/4% senior notes, and the impact of the interest rate hedge. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by the capitalization of $34.9 million of interest during the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, compared to $17.5 million of interest capitalized during the same period in 2006. We capitalize interest costs associated with our FCC licenses and property and equipment during the construction of a new market. The amount of such capitalized interest depends on the carrying values of the FCC licenses and construction in progress involved in those markets and the duration of the construction process. We expect capitalized interest to continue to be significant during the construction of the markets associated with the AWS licenses we were granted in November 2006 as a result of Auction 66. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. In November 2006, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our first and second lien credit agreements and the exchangeable secured and unsecured bridge credit agreements. As a result, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of approximately $42.7 million of the first and second lien credit agreements and an approximately $9.4 million loss on the extinguishment of the exchangeable secured and unsecured bridge credit agreements. Impairment Loss on Investment Securities. We can and have historically invested our substantial cash balances in, among other things, securities issued and fully guaranteed by the United States or any state, highly rated commercial paper and auction rate securities, money market funds meeting certain criteria, and demand deposits. 69 Table of Contents These investments are subject to credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk. We made investments of $133.9 million in certain “AAA” rated auction rate securities some of which are secured by collateralized debt obligations with a portion of the underlying collateral being mortgage securities or related to mortgage securities. With the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets, the auction rate securities held by us at December 31, 2007 have experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale in the auctions has exceeded the amount of purchase orders. As a result, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss on investment securities in the amount of $97.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased to $123.1 million, which is approximately 55% of our income before provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes a tax valuation allowance on the impairment loss on investment securities equal to 15% of our income before provision in income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2006 the provision for income taxes was $36.7 million, or approximately 41% of income before provision for income taxes. Net Income. Net income increased $46.6 million, or 87%, to $100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $53.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is primarily attributable to a 35% growth in customers during the year ended December 31, 2007 as well as cost benefits achieved due to the increasing scale of our business in the Core and Expansion Markets. In addition, the increase in net income is due to a 197% increase in interest income as a result of the significant increase in our cash balances due to proceeds from our initial public offering and additional funding under our 91/4% senior notes. However, these benefits were partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to an increase in the Company’s average debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 as well as the $97.8 million impairment loss on investment securities. Performance Measures In managing our business and assessing our financial performance, we supplement the information provided by financial statement measures with several customer-focused performance metrics that are widely used in the wireless industry. These metrics include average revenue per user per month, or ARPU, which measures service revenue per customer; cost per gross customer addition, or CPGA, which measures the average cost of acquiring a new customer; cost per user per month, or CPU, which measures the non-selling cash cost of operating our business on a per customer basis; and churn, which measures turnover in our customer base. Effective December 31, 2008, we revised our definition of ARPU to include activation revenues. Activation revenues are related to the reactivation of accounts that have previously disconnected and we believe that these revenues are more appropriately presented as a component of ARPU rather than a reduction to CPGA. Prior year measures have been restated to reflect this revision. For a reconciliation of Non-GAAP performance measures and a further discussion of the measures, please read “— Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. The following table shows annual metric information for 2006, 2007 and 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 Customers: End of period 2,940,986 3,962,786 5,366,833 Net additions 1,016,365 1,021,800 1,404,047 Churn: Average monthly rate 4.6 % 4.7 % 4.7 % ARPU $ 43.26 $ 43.31 $ 41.39 CPGA $ 121.12 $ 127.97 $ 127.21 CPU $ 19.65 $ 18.33 $ 18.17 Customers. Net customer additions were 1,404,047 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 1,021,800 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Total customers were 5,366,833 as of December 31, 2008, an increase of 35% over the customer total as of December 31, 2007. The increase in total customers is primarily attributable to the continued demand for our service offerings and the launch of our services in new markets. Net customer additions were 1,021,800 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 1,016,365 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total customers were 3,962,786 as of December 31, 2007, an increase of 35% over the customer total as of December 31, 2006. The increase in total customers in 2007 was largely attributable to the continued demand for our service offerings and the launch of our services in new markets. 70 Table of Contents Churn. As we do not require a long-term service contract, our churn percentage is expected to be higher than traditional wireless carriers that require customers to sign a one- to two-year contract with significant early termination fees. Average monthly churn represents (a) the number of customers who have been disconnected from our system during the measurement period less the number of customers who have reactivated service, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. We classify delinquent customers as churn after they have been delinquent for 30 days. In addition, when an existing customer establishes a new account in connection with the purchase of an upgraded or replacement phone and does not identify themselves as an existing customer, we count the phone leaving service as a churn and the new phone entering service as a gross customer addition. Churn remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2008 at 4.7%. Churn for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 4.7% compared to 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The 0.1% increase in churn was due to normal historical trends related to the maturity of our markets coupled with continued disconnects from the significant increase in gross additions in the first quarter of 2007 compared to the first quarter of 2006. Our customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. Based on historical results, we generally expect net customer additions to be strongest in the first and fourth quarters. Softening of sales and increased churn in the second and third quarters of the year usually combine to result in fewer net customer additions during these quarters. See — “Seasonality.” Average Revenue Per User. ARPU represents (a) service revenues less pass through charges for the measurement period, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. ARPU was $41.39 and $43.31 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The $1.92 decrease in ARPU was primarily attributable to higher participation in our Family Plans as well as reduced revenue from certain features included in our service plans that were previously provided a la carte. ARPU increased $0.05 during 2007 from $43.26 for the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2008, approximately 80% of our customers were on the $40 or higher rate plan. Cost Per Gross Addition. CPGA is determined by dividing (a) selling expenses plus the total cost of equipment associated with transactions with new customers less equipment revenues associated with transactions with new customers during the measurement period by (b) gross customer additions during such period. Retail customer service expenses and equipment margin on handsets sold to existing customers when they are identified, including handset upgrade transactions, are excluded, as these costs are incurred specifically for existing customers. CPGA has decreased to $127.21 for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $127.97 for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was primarily driven by a 33% increase in gross additions, partially offset by an increase in selling expenses associated with the continued customer growth in our Expansion Markets and the launch of service in new markets. CPGA increased to $127.97 for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $121.12 for the year ended December 31, 2006, which was primarily driven by the selling expenses and equipment subsidy associated with the customer growth in our Expansion Markets as well as selling expenses associated with the launch of service in new markets. Cost Per User. CPU is cost of service and general and administrative costs (excluding applicable non-cash stock-based compensation expense included in cost of service and general and administrative expense) plus net loss on handset equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition, divided by the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. CPU for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $18.17 and $18.33, respectively. CPU for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $19.65. We continue to achieve cost benefits due to the increasing scale of our business. However, these benefits have been partially offset by a combination of the construction and launch expenses associated with our Expansion Markets, which contributed approximately $3.91, $3.36 and $3.42 of additional CPU for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The following table shows consolidated quarterly metric information for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008.

A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows; or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented. ARPU, CPGA, and CPU are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to judge our ability to meet our liquidity requirements and to evaluate our operating performance. We believe these measures are important in understanding the performance of our operations from period to period, and although every company in the wireless industry does not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures (which are common in the wireless industry) facilitate key liquidity and operating performance comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry. The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures with our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. ARPU — We utilize ARPU to evaluate our per-customer service revenue realization and to assist in forecasting our future service revenues. ARPU is calculated exclusive of pass through charges that we collect from our customers and remit to the appropriate government agencies. Average number of customers for any measurement period is determined by dividing (a) the sum of the average monthly number of customers for the measurement period by (b) the number of months in such period. Average monthly number of customers for any month represents the sum of the number of customers on the first day of the month and the last day of the month divided by two. The following table shows the calculation of ARPU for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 (In thousands, except average number of customers and ARPU) Calculation of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Service revenues $ 1,290,947 $ 1,919,197 $ 2,437,250 Less: Pass through charges (45,640 ) (95,946 ) (136,801 ) Net service revenues $ 1,245,307 $ 1,823,251 $ 2,300,449 Divided by: Average number of customers 2,398,682 3,508,497 4,631,168 ARPU $ 43.26 $ 43.31 $ 41.39 Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, 2007 2007 2007 2007 (In thousands, except average number of customers and ARPU) Calculation of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Service revenues $ 439,516 $ 479,341 $ 489,131 $ 511,209 Less: Pass through charges (20,271 ) (25,721 ) (25,215 ) (24,740 ) Net service revenues $ 419,245 $ 453,620 $ 463,916 $ 486,469 Divided by: Average number of customers 3,175,284 3,480,780 3,592,045 3,785,880 ARPU $ 44.01 $ 43.44 $ 43.05 $ 42.83 Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, 2008 2008 2008 2008 (In thousands, except average number of customers and ARPU) Calculation of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Service revenues $ 561,970 $ 598,562 $ 610,691 $ 666,028 Less: Pass through charges (26,554 ) (30,583 ) (31,445 ) (48,220 ) Net service revenues $ 535,416 $ 567,979 $ 579,246 $ 617,808 Divided by: Average number of customers 4,198,794 4,501,980 4,741,043 5,082,856 ARPU $ 42.51 $ 42.05 $ 40.73 $ 40.52 74 Table of Contents CPGA — We utilize CPGA to assess the efficiency of our distribution strategy, validate the initial capital invested in our customers and determine the number of months to recover our customer acquisition costs. This measure also allows us to compare our average acquisition costs per new customer to those of other wireless broadband mobile providers. Equipment revenues related to new customers are deducted from selling expenses in this calculation as they represent amounts paid by customers at the time their service is activated that reduce our acquisition cost of those customers. Additionally, equipment costs associated with existing customers, net of related revenues, are excluded as this measure is intended to reflect only the acquisition costs related to new customers. The following table reconciles total costs used in the calculation of CPGA to selling expenses, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to CPGA.

CPU does not include any depreciation and amortization expense. Management uses CPU as a tool to evaluate the non-selling cash expenses associated with ongoing business operations on a per customer basis, to track changes in these non-selling cash costs over time, and to help evaluate how changes in our business operations affect non-selling cash costs per customer. In addition, CPU provides management with a useful measure to compare our non-selling cash costs per customer with those of other wireless providers. We believe investors use CPU primarily as a tool to track changes in our non-selling cash costs over time and to compare our non-selling cash costs to those of other wireless providers, although other wireless carriers may calculate this measure differently. The following table reconciles total costs used in the calculation of CPU to cost of service, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to CPU. 75 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 (In thousands, except average number of customers and CPU) Calculation of Cost Per User (CPU): Cost of service $ 445,281 $ 647,510 $ 857,295 Add: General and administrative expenses 138,998 198,955 235,289 Add: Net loss on equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition 41,538 49,331 95,282 Less: Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of service and general and administrative expense (14,472 ) (28,024 ) (41,142 ) Less: Pass through charges (45,640 ) (95,946 ) (136,801 ) Total costs used in the calculation of CPU $ 565,705 $ 771,826 $ 1,009,923 Divided by: Average number of customers 2,398,682 3,508,497 4,631,168 CPU $ 19.65 $ 18.33 $ 18.17 Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, 2007 2007 2007 2007 (In thousands, except average number of customers and CPU) Calculation of Cost Per User (CPU): Cost of service $ 145,335 $ 162,227 $ 163,671 $ 176,277 Add: General and administrative expenses 42,831 49,352 48,871 57,900 Add: Net loss on equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition 13,160 9,903 11,664 14,606 Less: Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of service and general and administrative expense (4,211 ) (7,653 ) (7,107 ) (9,053 ) Less: Pass through charges (20,271 ) (25,721 ) (25,215 ) (24,740 ) Total costs used in the calculation of CPU $ 176,844 $ 188,108 $ 191,884 $ 214,990 Divided by: Average number of customers 3,175,284 3,480,780 3,592,045 3,785,880 CPU $ 18.56 $ 18.01 $ 17.81 $ 18.93 Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, 2008 2008 2008 2008 (In thousands, except average number of customers and CPU) Calculation of Cost Per User (CPU): Cost of service $ 188,473 $ 206,140 $ 219,423 $ 243,259 Add: General and administrative expenses 57,727 60,239 57,738 59,584 Add: Net loss on equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition 26,409 21,380 23,596 23,897 Less: Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of service and general and administrative expense (8,465 ) (11,007 ) (10,782 ) (10,888 ) Less: Pass through charges (26,554 ) (30,583 ) (31,445 ) (48,220 ) Total costs used in the calculation of CPU $ 237,590 $ 246,169 $ 258,530 $ 267,632 Divided by: Average number of customers 4,198,794 4,501,980 4,741,043 5,082,856 CPU $ 18.86 $ 18.23 $ 18.18 $ 17.55 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations. At December 31, 2008, we had a total of approximately $697.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. Over the last year, the capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile as a result of adverse economic and financial conditions that have triggered the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies and a global recession. We believe that this increased volatility and global recession may make it difficult to obtain additional financing or sell additional equity or debt securities. We believe that, based on our current level of cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from operations, the current adverse economic and financial conditions in the credit and capital markets will not have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, cash flow, financial flexibility or our ability to fund our operations in the near-term. We have historically invested our substantial cash balances in, among other things, securities issued and fully guaranteed by the United States or the states, highly rated commercial paper and auction rate securities, money market funds meeting certain criteria, and demand deposits. These investments are subject to credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk. At December 31, 2008, we had invested substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents in money market funds consisting of U.S. treasury securities. 76 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2007, we made an original investment of $133.9 million in principal in certain auction rate securities, substantially all of which are secured by collateralized debt obligations with a portion of the underlying collateral being mortgage securities or related to mortgage securities. Consistent with our investment policy guidelines, the auction rate securities investments held by us all had AAA/Aaa credit ratings at the time of purchase. With the continued liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets, the auction rate securities held by us at December 31, 2008 continue to experience failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale in the auctions exceeds the amount of purchase orders. In addition, all of the auction rate securities held by us have been downgraded or placed on credit watch. The estimated market value of our auction rate security holdings at December 31, 2008 was approximately $6.0 million, which reflects a $127.9 million cumulative adjustment to the original principal value of $133.9 million. The estimated market value at December 31, 2007 was approximately $36.1 million, which reflected a $97.8 million adjustment to the aggregate principal value at that date. Although the auction rate securities continue to pay interest according to their stated terms, based on valuation models that rely exclusively on unobservable inputs, we recorded an impairment charge of $30.9 million and $97.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, reflecting an additional portion of our auction rate security holdings that we have concluded have an other-than-temporary decline in value. The offsetting increase in fair value of approximately $0.8 million is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. Historically, given the liquidity created by auctions, our auction rate securities were presented as current assets under short-term investments on our balance sheet. Given the failed auctions, our auction rate securities are illiquid until there is a successful auction for them or we sell them. Accordingly, the entire amount of such remaining auction rate securities has been reclassified from current to non-current assets and is presented in long-term investments on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. The $6.0 million estimated market value at December 31, 2008 does not materially impact our liquidity and is not included in our approximately $697.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2008. We may incur additional impairments to our auction rate securities which may be up to the full remaining value of such auction rate securities. Management believes that any future additional impairment charges will not have a material effect on our liquidity. On April 24, 2007, MetroPCS Communications consummated an initial public offering of its common stock. MetroPCS Communications sold 37,500,000 shares of common stock at a price per share of $23.00 (less underwriting discounts and commissions), which resulted in net proceeds to MetroPCS Communications of approximately $818.3 million. In addition, selling stockholders sold an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of common stock, including 7,500,000 shares sold pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option. MetroPCS Communications did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders; however, MetroPCS Communications did receive proceeds of approximately $3.8 million from the exercise of options to acquire common stock which was sold in the initial public offering. Concurrent with the initial public offering by MetroPCS Communications, all outstanding shares of preferred stock of MetroPCS Communications, including accrued but unpaid dividends as of April 23, 2007, were converted into 150,962,644 shares of common stock. On June 6, 2007, MetroPCS Wireless, Inc., or Wireless, consummated the sale of the additional notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million. The proceeds from the sale of the additional notes were approximately $421.0 million. On January 20, 2009, Wireless consummated the sale of $550.0 million of 91/4% senior notes due 2014, or new notes. The net proceeds from the sale of the new notes was approximately $480.5 million. The net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes which could include working capital, capital expenditures, future liquidity needs, additional opportunistic spectrum acquisitions, corporate development opportunities and future technology initiatives. Our strategy has been to offer our services in major metropolitan areas and their surrounding areas, which we refer to as clusters. We are seeking opportunities to enhance our current market clusters and to provide service in new geographic areas. From time to time, we may purchase spectrum and related assets from third parties or the FCC. As a result of the acquisition of spectrum licenses and the opportunities that these licenses provide for us to expand our operations into major metropolitan markets, we will require significant additional capital in the future to finance the construction and initial operating costs associated with such licenses. We generally do not intend to commence the construction of any individual license area until we have sufficient funds available to provide for the related construction and operating costs associated with such license area. We currently plan to focus on building out networks to cover approximately 40 million of total population during 2009-2010 including the launch of the Boston and New York metropolitan areas in February 2009. Our initial launch dates will be accomplished in phases in the larger metropolitan areas. Our future builds will entail a more extensive use of distributed antenna systems, or DAS, systems than we have deployed in the past. This, along with other factors, could result in an increase in the 77 Table of Contents total capital expenditures per covered population to initially launch operations. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fully fund this planned expansion. The construction of our network and the marketing and distribution of our wireless communications products and services have required, and will continue to require, substantial capital investment. Capital outlays have included license acquisition costs, capital expenditures for construction of our network infrastructure, costs associated with clearing and relocating non-governmental incumbent licenses, funding of operating cash flow losses incurred as we launch services in new metropolitan areas and other working capital costs, debt service and financing fees and expenses. Our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were approximately $954.6 million, $767.7 million and $550.7 million, respectively. These expenditures were primarily associated with the construction of the network infrastructure in our Expansion Markets and our efforts to increase the service area and capacity of our existing Core Markets network through the addition of cell sites and switches. We believe the increased service area and capacity in existing markets will improve our service offering, helping us to attract additional customers and increase revenues. In addition, we believe our new Expansion Markets have attractive demographics which will result in increased revenues. As of December 31, 2008, we owed an aggregate of approximately $3.0 billion under our senior secured credit facility and 91/4% senior notes. As of December 31, 2008, we owed approximately $91.3 million under our capital lease obligations. Our senior secured credit facility calculates consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as: consolidated net income plus depreciation and amortization; gain (loss) on disposal of assets; non-cash expenses; gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt; provision for income taxes; interest expense; and certain expenses of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. minus interest and other income and non-cash items increasing consolidated net income. We consider consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, to be an important indicator to investors because it provides information related to our ability to provide cash flows to meet future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and fund future growth. We present consolidated Adjusted EBITDA because covenants in our senior secured credit facility contain ratios based on this measure. Other wireless carriers may calculate consolidated Adjusted EBITDA differently. If our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA were to decline below certain levels, covenants in our senior secured credit facility that are based on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, including our maximum senior secured leverage ratio covenant, may be violated and could cause, among other things, an inability to incur further indebtedness and in certain circumstances a default or mandatory prepayment under our senior secured credit facility. Our maximum senior secured leverage ratio is required to be less than 4.5 to 1.0 based on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA plus the impact of certain new markets. The lenders under our senior secured credit facility use the senior secured leverage ratio to measure our ability to meet our obligations on our senior secured debt by comparing the total amount of such debt to our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which our lenders use to estimate our cash flow from operations. The senior secured leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of senior secured indebtedness to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by our senior secured credit facility. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, our senior secured leverage ratio was 1.95 to 1.0, which means for every $1.00 of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA we had $1.95 of senior secured indebtedness. In addition, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is also utilized, among other measures, to determine management’s compensation levels. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss), or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to, or more meaningful than cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. 78 Table of Contents The following table shows the calculation of our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our senior secured credit facility, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 (In Thousands) Calculation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 53,806 $ 100,403 $ 149,438 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 135,028 178,202 255,319 Loss on disposal of assets 8,806 655 18,905 Stock-based compensation expense(1) 14,472 28,024 41,142 Interest expense 115,985 201,746 179,398 Accretion of put option in majority-owned subsidiary(1) 770 1,003 1,258 Interest and other income (21,543 ) (63,936 ) (23,170 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt 51,518 — — Impairment loss on investment securities — 97,800 30,857 Provision for income taxes 36,717 123,098 129,986 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $ 395,559 $ 666,995 $ 783,133 (1) Represents a non-cash expense, as defined by our senior secured credit facility. In addition, for further information, the following table reconciles consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our senior secured credit facility, to cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 (In Thousands) Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 364,761 $ 589,306 $ 447,490 Adjustments: Interest expense 115,985 201,746 179,398 Non-cash interest expense (6,964 ) (3,259 ) (2,550 ) Interest and other income (21,543 ) (63,936 ) (23,170 ) Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable (31 ) (129 ) (8 ) Deferred rent expense (7,464 ) (13,745 ) (20,646 ) Cost of abandoned cell sites (3,783 ) (6,704 ) (8,592 ) Accretion of asset retirement obligation (769 ) (1,439 ) (3,542 ) Gain on sale of investments 2,385 10,506 — Provision for income taxes 36,717 123,098 129,986 Deferred income taxes (32,341 ) (118,524 ) (124,347 ) Changes in working capital (51,394 ) (49,925 ) 209,114 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $ 395,559 $ 666,995 $ 783,133 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities decreased $141.8 million to $447.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 from $589.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in working capital during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007, partially offset by an approximately 49% increase in net income as a result of the growth experienced over the last twelve months. Cash provided by operating activities increased $224.5 million to $589.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 from $364.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an 87% increase in net income as well as a 266% increase in deferred income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities increased $81.6 million to $364.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 from $283.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 as well as an increase in deferred revenues due to an approximately 53% increase in customers during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. 79 Table of Contents Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $517.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was due primarily to $328.5 million in purchases of FCC licenses, $25.2 million in cash used for business acquisitions, a $186.9 million increase in purchases of property and equipment which was primarily related to construction in the Expansion Markets, and $267.2 million in net proceeds from the sale of investments during the year ended December 31, 2007 that did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2008. Cash used in investing activities was $517.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $1.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was mainly due to $1.4 billion in purchases of FCC licenses during the year ended December 31, 2006 that did not recur in 2007 as well as a $264.7 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of investments, partially offset by a $217.0 million increase in purchases of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities was $1.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $905.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was due primarily to an $887.7 million increase in purchases of FCC licenses and a $284.3 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a $355.5 million decrease in net purchases of investments. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $74.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $1.2 billion for year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was due primarily to $818.3 million in net proceeds from the Company’s initial public offering that was completed in April 2007 and $420.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the additional notes in June 2007 that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in proceeds from various financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2007 included $818.3 million in net proceeds from the company’s initial public offering that was completed in April 2007 and $421.0 million in net proceeds from the sale of additional notes in June 2007. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $712.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was due primarily to net proceeds from the senior secured credit facility and the issuance of the 91/4% senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. First and Second Lien Credit Agreements On November 3, 2006, we paid the lenders under the first and second lien credit agreements $931.5 million plus accrued interest of $8.6 million to extinguish the aggregate outstanding principal balance under the first and second lien credit agreements. As a result, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of approximately $42.7 million. On November 21, 2006, we terminated the interest rate cap agreement that was required by our first and second lien credit agreements. We received approximately $4.3 million upon termination of the agreement. The proceeds from the termination of the agreement approximated its carrying value. Bridge Credit Facilities In July 2006, MetroPCS II, Inc., or MetroPCS II, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (which has since merged into Wireless), entered into an Exchangeable Senior Secured Credit Agreement and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of July 13, 2006, or the secured bridge credit facility. The aggregate credit commitments available under the secured bridge credit facility were $1.25 billion and were fully funded. 80 Table of Contents On November 3, 2006, MetroPCS II repaid the aggregate outstanding principal balance under the secured bridge credit facility of $1.25 billion and accrued interest of $5.9 million. As a result, MetroPCS II recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $7.0 million. In October 2006, MetroPCS IV, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (which has since merged into Wireless), entered into an additional Exchangeable Senior Unsecured Bridge Credit Facility, or the unsecured bridge credit facility. The aggregate credit commitments available under the unsecured bridge credit facility were $250.0 million and were fully funded. On November 3, 2006, MetroPCS IV, Inc. repaid the aggregate outstanding principal balance under the unsecured bridge credit facility of $250.0 million and accrued interest of $1.2 million. As a result, MetroPCS IV, Inc. recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $2.4 million. Senior Secured Credit Facility Wireless, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MetroPCS Communications, Inc., entered into the Senior Secured Credit Facility on November 3, 2006, or senior secured credit facility. The senior secured credit facility consists of a $1.6 billion term loan facility and a $100 million revolving credit facility. The term loan facility is repayable in quarterly installments in annual aggregate amounts equal to 1% of the initial aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion. The term loan facility will mature in November 2013. The revolving credit facility will mature in November 2011. The facilities under the senior secured credit agreement are guaranteed by MetroPCS Communications, Inc., MetroPCS, Inc. and each of Wireless’ direct and indirect present and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. The facilities are not guaranteed by Royal Street, but Wireless has pledged the promissory note given by Royal Street in connection with amounts borrowed by Royal Street from Wireless and we pledged the limited liability company member interests we hold in Royal Street. The senior secured credit facility contains customary events of default, including cross defaults. The obligations are also secured by the capital stock of Wireless as well as substantially all of the present and future assets of Wireless and each of its direct and indirect present and future wholly-owned subsidiaries (except as prohibited by law and certain permitted exceptions). Under the senior secured credit agreement, Wireless will be subject to certain limitations, including limitations on its ability to incur additional debt, make certain restricted payments, sell assets, make certain investments or acquisitions, grant liens and pay dividends. Wireless is also subject to certain financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum senior secured consolidated leverage ratio and, under certain circumstances, maximum consolidated leverage and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios. There is no prohibition on our ability to make investments in or loan money to Royal Street. Amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facility bear interest at a LIBOR rate plus a margin as set forth in the facility and the terms of the senior secured credit facility require us to enter into interest rate hedging agreements that fix the interest rate in an amount equal to at least 50% of our outstanding indebtedness, including the notes. On November 21, 2006, Wireless entered into a three-year interest rate protection agreement to manage its interest rate risk exposure and fulfill a requirement of its senior secured credit facility. The agreement covers a notional amount of $1.0 billion and effectively converts this portion of Wireless’ variable rate debt to fixed-rate debt at an annual rate of 7.169%. The quarterly interest settlement periods began on February 1, 2007. The interest rate protection agreement expires on February 1, 2010. On February 20, 2007, Wireless entered into an amendment to the senior secured credit facility. Under the amendment, the margin used to determine the senior secured credit facility interest rate was reduced to 2.25% from 2.50%. On April 30, 2008, Wireless entered into an additional two-year interest rate protection agreement to manage its interest rate risk exposure. The agreement was effective on June 30, 2008 and covers a notional amount of $500.0 million and effectively converts this portion of Wireless’ variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at an annual rate of 5.464%. The monthly interest settlement periods began on June 30, 2008. The interest rate protection agreement expires on June 30, 2010. 81 Table of Contents 91/4% Senior Notes Due 2014 On November 3, 2006, Wireless consummated the sale of $1.0 billion principal amount of its initial senior notes. On June 6, 2007, Wireless consummated the sale of an additional $400.0 million principal amount of additional notes. The initial senior notes and the additional notes are referred to together as the 91/4% senior notes. The 91/4% senior notes are unsecured obligations and are guaranteed by MetroPCS Communications, Inc., MetroPCS, Inc., and all of Wireless direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, but are not guaranteed by Royal Street. Interest is payable on the initial senior notes on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning with May 1, 2007, with respect to the initial senior notes, and beginning on November 1, 2007 with respect to the additional notes. Wireless may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 91/4% senior notes at any time on or after November 1, 2010 for the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 91/4% senior notes. In addition, Wireless may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 91/4% senior notes with the net cash proceeds of certain sales of equity securities, including the sale of common stock. On January 14, 2009, Wireless completed the sale of the new notes at a price equal to 89.50% of the principal amount of such new notes. On January 20, 2009, Wireless consummated the sale of the new notes resulting in net proceeds of $480.5 million. The net proceeds from the sale of the new notes will be used for general corporate purposes which could include working capital, capital expenditures, future liquidity needs, additional opportunistic spectrum acquisitions, corporate development opportunities and future technology initiatives. The new notes are unsecured obligations and are guaranteed by MetroPCS, MetroPCS, Inc., and all of Wireless’ direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, but are not guaranteed by Royal Street. Interest is payable on the new notes on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2009. Capital Lease Obligations We have entered into various non-cancelable DAS capital lease agreements, with expirations through 2024, covering dedicated optical fiber. Assets and future obligations related to capital leases are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in property and equipment and long-term debt, respectively. Depreciation of assets held under capital lease obligations is included in depreciation and amortization expense. Capital Expenditures and Other Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions Capital Expenditures. We and Royal Street currently expect to incur capital expenditures in the range of $0.7 billion to $0.9 billion on a consolidated basis for the year ending December 31, 2009. We plan to focus on building out networks to cover approximately 40 million of total population during 2009-2010, including the launch of the Boston and New York metropolitan areas in February 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we and Royal Street incurred $954.6 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion and improvement of our existing network infrastructure and costs associated with the construction of new markets. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we and Royal Street incurred $767.7 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion and improvement of our existing network infrastructure and costs associated with the construction of new markets. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we had $550.7 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion and improvement of our existing network infrastructure and costs associated with the construction of new markets. Other Acquisitions and Dispositions. On November 29, 2006, we were granted AWS licenses as a result of FCC Auction 66, for a total aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion. On December 21, 2007, we executed an agreement with PTA Communications, Inc., or PTA, to purchase 10 MHz of PCS spectrum from PTA for the basic trading area of Jacksonville, Florida. We also entered into agreements with NTCH, Inc. (dba Cleartalk PCS) and PTA-FLA, Inc. for the purchase of certain of their assets used in providing PCS wireless telecommunications services in the Jacksonville market. On January 17, 2008, we closed on the acquisition of the assets and paid a total of $18.6 million in cash for these assets, exclusive of transaction costs. On May 13, 2008, we closed on the purchase of the 10 MHz of spectrum from PTA for the basic trading area of Jacksonville, Florida for consideration of $6.5 million in cash. 82 Table of Contents We participated as a bidder in Auction 73 and on June 26, 2008, we were granted one 12 MHz 700 MHz license for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $313.3 million. The 700 MHz License supplements the 10 MHz of advanced wireless spectrum previously granted to us in the Boston-Worcester, Massachusetts/New Hampshire/Rhode Island/Vermont Economic Area as a result of Auction 66. On various dates in 2008, we consummated agreements for spectrum acquisitions from third-parties in the aggregate amount of approximately $15.3 million. On September 26, 2008, we entered into a spectrum exchange agreement covering licenses in certain markets with Leap Wireless International, Inc. (“Leap Wireless”) with Leap Wireless acquiring an additional 10 MHz of spectrum in San Diego and Fresno, California; Seattle, Washington and certain other Washington and Oregon markets, and we will acquire an additional 10 MHz of spectrum in Shreveport-Bossier City, Louisiana; Lakeland-Winter Haven, Florida; and Dallas-Ft. Worth, Texas and certain other North Texas markets, with consummation subject to customary closing conditions. On various dates in 2008, we entered into agreements for the acquisition of spectrum from third parties in the aggregate amount of approximately $8.3 million. Consummation of these acquisitions is conditioned upon customary closing conditions, including approval by the FCC. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table provides aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008. See Note 12 to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Payments Due by Period Less More Than Than Total 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt, including current portion $ 2,964,000 $ 16,000 $ 32,000 $ 1,516,000 $ 1,400,000 Interest expense on long-term debt(1) 1,232,843 230,269 457,444 437,213 107,917 Alcatel Lucent purchase commitment 21,600 21,600 — — — Contractual tax obligations (2) 2,773 2,773 — — — Capital lease obligations 186,499 10,213 21,357 22,658 132,271 Operating leases 1,753,010 204,296 419,156 398,231 731,327 Total cash contractual obligations $ 6,160,725 $ 485,151 $ 929,957 $ 2,374,102 $ 2,371,515 (1) Interest expense on long-term debt includes future interest payments on outstanding obligations under our senior secured credit facility and 9 1/4% senior notes. The senior secured credit facility bears interest at a floating rate tied to a fixed spread to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate. The interest expense presented in this table is based on the rates at December 31, 2008 which was 6.443% for the senior secured credit facility. (2) Represents the liability reported in accordance with the Company’s adoption of the provisions of FIN 48. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, other than the items included in the table above, the Company was unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these remaining liabilities might be paid. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $16.6 million as of December 31, 2008, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 18, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Inflation We believe that inflation has not materially affected our operations. 83 Table of Contents Effect of New Accounting Standards In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations,” (“SFAS No. 141(R)”), which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and early adoption is prohibited. The implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements,” (“SFAS No. 160”), which establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent’s ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and early adoption is prohibited. The implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133,” (“SFAS No. 161”). SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures about a company’s derivative and hedging activities. These enhanced disclosures will discuss (a) how and why a company uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FASB Statement No. 133 and its related interpretations and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after November 15, 2008, with earlier adoption allowed. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets,” (“FSP SFAS No. 142-3”). FSP SFAS No. 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” FSP SFAS No. 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157-3 “Determining Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active,” (“FSP SFAS No. 157-3”). FSP SFAS No. 157-3 clarified the application of SFAS No. 157 in an inactive market. It demonstrates how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive. FSP SFAS No. 157-3 was effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In November 2008, the FASB issued EITF No. 08-6, “Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations,” (“EITF No. 08-6”). EITF No. 08-6 clarifies the accounting treatment for certain transactions and impairment considerations involving equity method investments. EITF No. 08-6 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008, consistent with the effective dates of SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 84 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, including interest rates. We do not routinely enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading, speculative or hedging purposes, unless it is hedging interest rate risk exposure or is required by our senior secured credit facility. We do not currently conduct business internationally, so we are generally not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $1.6 billion in outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility that bears interest at floating rates based on the London Inter Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.25%. The interest rate on the outstanding debt under our senior secured credit facility as of December 31, 2008 was 6.443%. On November 21, 2006, to manage our interest rate risk exposure and fulfill a requirement of our senior secured credit facility, we entered into a three-year interest rate protection agreement. This agreement covers a notional amount of $1.0 billion and effectively converts this portion of our variable rate debt to fixed-rate debt at an annual rate of 7.169%. The quarterly interest settlement periods began on February 1, 2007. The interest rate swap agreement expires in 2010. On April 30, 2008, to manage our interest rate risk exposure, we entered into a two-year interest rate protection agreement. The agreement was effective on June 30, 2008, covers a notional amount of $500.0 million and effectively converts this portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at an annual rate of 5.464%. The monthly interest settlement periods began on June 30, 2008. The interest rate protection agreement expires on June 30, 2010. If market LIBOR rates increase 100 basis points over the rates in effect at December 31, 2008, annual interest expense on the approximately $64.0 million in variable rate debt would increase approximately $0.6 million.",2023-12-30 17:44:04.687216
1283699,TMUS,"T-Mobile US, Inc.",2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Company Overview On February 25, 2004, MetroPCS, Inc. formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary named MetroPCS Communications, Inc. In July 2004, MetroPCS, Inc. merged with a subsidiary of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. pursuant to a transaction that resulted in all of the capital stock of MetroPCS, Inc. (and the options and warrants related thereto) converting into capital stock of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (and the options and warrants), and MetroPCS, Inc. becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. The financial statements results discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are those of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We have not included a separate discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of MetroPCS, Inc. and its subsidiaries because their results of operations are not materially different than the results of operations of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We are a wireless telecommunications carrier that offers wireless broadband personal communication services primarily in the Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, Detroit, Miami, San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose, Sacramento and Tampa-Sarasota metropolitan areas. We launched service in the greater Atlanta, Miami and Sacramento metropolitan areas in the first quarter of 2002; in San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose in September 2002; in Tampa-Sarasota in October 2005; in Dallas-Fort Worth in March 2006; and Detroit in April 2006. In 2005, Royal Street Communications, LLC (“Royal Street”), a company in which we own an 85% interest, and with which we have a wholesale arrangement that will allow us to sell MetroPCS-branded services to the public on up to 85% of the engineered capacity of the Royal Street systems, was granted licenses by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) in Los Angeles and various metropolitan areas throughout northern Florida. Royal Street is in the process of building network infrastructure in these metropolitan areas and expects to commence commercial services in Orlando in 2006 and in Los Angeles in 2007. As a result of the significant growth we have experienced since we launched operations, our results of operations to date are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected in future periods. Moreover, we expect that our number of customers will continue to increase, which will continue to contribute to increases in our revenues and operating expenses. We sell products and services to customers through our Company-owned retail stores, which numbered 57 as of December 31, 2004, as well as through relationships with indirect retailers. We offer service which allows our customers to place unlimited local calls from within our local service area and to receive unlimited calls from any area, while in our local service area, for a simple and affordable flat monthly rate plan starting at $30 per month. For an additional $5 to $15 per month, our customers may opt for a service agreement that offers more flexibility in options such as unlimited long distance calling from within our local service area to anywhere within the continental United States, voicemail, text, picture and multimedia messaging. For additional fees, we also provide international long distance, directory assistance, caller ID, downloads of ringtones, games and content applications and other value-added services. In 2002, we offered only one handset to customers for $149. In 2003, our offering of handsets had grown to five different handsets priced from $129 to $219 and as of December 31, 2004, we offered nine different handsets priced from $99 to $239. Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements In August 2004, we determined that we had understated revenues for the three month period ended March 31, 2004. As a result, the audit committee of our board of directors then commenced an independent investigation into the understatement and retained independent legal counsel to assist in the investigation. In connection with the independent investigation, we performed an extensive review of various accounting policies and practices for transactions in our financial statement close process in prior years and, in consultation with the audit committee of our board of directors, we determined that it was appropriate to restate our previously reported consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. These restatements resulted from the correction of accounting errors resulting from material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that are further discussed in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, contained in this report. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for a summary of the effects of these changes on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003, as well as on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, and changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. The accompanying Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations gives effect to these corrections and adjustments. 39 Table of Contents Classification of Short-Term Investments. We determined that certain investments were inappropriately classified under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” (“SFAS No. 115”). As a result, we recorded adjustments to appropriately classify our investments in accordance with SFAS No. 115, and record the unrealized gains and losses to other comprehensive income (loss). These adjustments resulted in (i) a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $167.5 million, (ii) an increase in short-term investments of $186.4 million, (iii) a decrease in long-term investments of $19.0 million, and (iv) recognition of accumulated other comprehensive loss of $0.1 million at December 31, 2003. In addition, the adjustments resulted in the recognition of a net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities of approximately $0.1 million, net of income taxes, for the year ended December 31, 2003. Inventory Valuation. We found errors in the valuation of replacement handsets used primarily for in-warranty exchanges which resulted in these inventories being overstated. As a result, we recorded restatement adjustments that resulted in (i) a decrease in inventories of $4.2 million at December 31, 2003 and (ii) an increase in cost of equipment of $2.0 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Additionally, we reviewed our accounting policy related to trade-in allowances granted to our customers toward the purchases of new handsets and determined that these trade-in allowances are a reduction of equipment revenue, rather than an increase in cost of equipment. As a result, we recorded restatement adjustments that resulted in (i) a decrease in equipment revenues of $3.5 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and (ii) a reduction in cost of equipment of $3.5 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Property and Equipment. We had not properly recorded certain assets when received as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. As a result, we understated our accounts related to property and equipment and accounts payable and accrued expenses, requiring correction and restatement of both assets and liabilities. These adjustments resulted in (i) a net increase in property and equipment of $2.2 million at December 31, 2003 and (ii) an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $0.3 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Revenue Recognition. We identified errors in our determination of revenues and deferred revenues as a result of an estimation process that had been utilized in prior years. We have subsequently developed a revenue recognition approach that allows a determination of revenues and deferred revenues based upon detailed customer level information. As a result of the errors identified in the prior approach, we determined that it was necessary to recalculate historical results utilizing this new method to ensure consistent reporting of revenue and deferred revenue within the historical and current consolidated financial statements. Changes in the revenue recognition model resulted in restatement adjustments that reduced deferred revenue in the amount of $0.6 million at December 31, 2003. In addition, these adjustments resulted in a reduction in service revenues of $1.4 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Lease Accounting. We reviewed our accounting policy with respect to lease transactions. Historically, when accounting for tower leases with renewal options, we recorded rent expense on a straight-line basis over the initial non-cancelable lease term, excluding any potential renewal periods. We have now recorded restatement adjustments that recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over a lease term that includes renewal periods that are reasonably assured, as required by SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” as amended. Cell site assets associated with such leased towers are depreciated over the shorter of the assets’ estimated useful lives or the lease term that includes the renewal periods that are reasonably assured to occur. The adjustments resulted in an increase in deferred rents in the amount of $2.9 million as of December 31, 2003, as well as an increase in cost of service in the amount of $1.6 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Accrued Dividends on Series D Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Participating Preferred Stock. Historically, we calculated the accrual of dividends on our Series D Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Participating Preferred Stock (“Series D Preferred Stock”) at a rate of 6.1% per annum when the certificate of designations for such stock stated that dividends should be accrued at a rate of 6% per annum. We recorded adjustments that corrected the historical accruals utilizing a 6% rate, resulting in the reduction of Series D Preferred Stock in the amount of $0.5 million at December 31, 2003, as well as a decrease in accrued dividends on Series D Preferred Stock of $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 40 Table of Contents Deferred Compensation. Historically, we did not properly apply the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” (“APB No. 25”) when calculating deferred compensation related to stock options granted below fair market value. We recalculated deferred compensation for the historical periods, resulting in restatement adjustments that (i) decreased deferred compensation by $0.1 million, and (ii) decreased additional paid-in capital by $1.0 million at December 31, 2003. In addition, selling, general and administrative expense decreased by $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and increased by $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Income Tax Accounting. Upon review of our calculation of income tax expense, we determined that we had not properly applied the provisions of SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Previously, we utilized a blended state tax rate to calculate our provision, record our deferred tax assets and liabilities and record tax reserves for uncertain tax positions. We have determined that the calculation should have been prepared on a state-by-state basis and, therefore, recalculated the provision using such approach. This calculation resulted in us recording additional tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 of $0.5 million and $6.4 million, respectively, including adjustments for the tax effect of all other restatement items. There was no change in the amount of cash paid for income taxes. We also recorded additional miscellaneous adjustments to various other accounts that were identified during the preparation of our 2004 consolidated financial statements or in connection with the restatement efforts discussed above. These adjustments resulted in (i) a $1.5 million decrease to total assets and a $9.3 million increase in total liabilities at December 31, 2003, (ii) a $1.1 million net decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 and (iii) a $1.7 million net increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2002. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. You should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory valuations, deferred income taxes, and the impairment of long-lived and indefinite-lived assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Our wireless services are provided on a month-to-month basis and are paid in advance. We recognize revenues from wireless services as they are rendered. Amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Suspending service for non-payment is known as hotlining. We do not recognize revenue on hotlined customers. Revenues and related costs from the sale of accessories are recognized at the point of sale. The cost of handsets sold to indirect retailers are included in deferred charges until they are sold to and activated by customers. Amounts billed to indirect retailers for handsets are recorded as accounts receivable and deferred revenue upon shipment by us and are recognized as equipment revenues when service is activated by customers. Our customers have the right to return handsets within a specified time or after a certain amount of use, whichever occurs first. We record an estimate for returns at the time of recognizing revenue. Effective July 1, 2003, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 00-21, “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” (“EITF No. 00-21”), which is being applied on a prospective 41 Table of Contents basis. The consensus also supersedes certain guidance set forth in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,” (“SAB 101”). SAB 101 was amended in December 2003 by Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 104, “Revenue Recognition,” (“SAB 104”). The consensus addresses the accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting and the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values. We determined that the sale of wireless services through our direct and indirect sales channels with an accompanying handset constitutes revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. Upon adoption of EITF No. 00-21, we began dividing these arrangements into separate units of accounting, and allocating the consideration between the handset and the wireless service based on their relative fair values. Consideration received for the handset is recognized as equipment revenue when the handset is delivered and accepted by the customer. Consideration received for the wireless service is recognized as service revenues when earned. Sales incentives offered without charge to customers related to the sale of handsets are recognized as a reduction of revenue when the related equipment revenue is recognized. In 2004, customers had the right to return handsets within 7 days or 60 minutes of usage, whichever occurs first. Prior to July 1, 2003, activation fees were deferred and amortized over the estimated customer life. On October 1, 2003, the Company changed its estimated customer life from 25 months to 14 months, based on historical disconnect rates, resulting in an increase in activation revenues of $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 over amounts that would have been recognized using the prior estimated life. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our indirect retailers to pay for equipment purchases and for amounts estimated to be uncollectible for intercarrier compensation. If the financial condition of a material portion of our indirect retailers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Inventories We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value or replacement cost based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Deferred Income Tax Asset and Other Tax Reserves We assess our deferred tax asset and record a valuation allowance, when necessary, to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future taxable income, taxable temporary differences and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period we made that determination. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax returns are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and ultimately modified. We adjust the reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of income tax related reserve positions and changes to income tax reserves that we consider appropriate. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is finally resolved. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash or a reduction in our net operating loss carryforwards. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the effective rate in the year of resolution. Tax reserves are presented on the balance sheet in other long-term liabilities. 42 Table of Contents Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Indefinite-Lived Assets We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, other than indefinite-lived intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or in the strategy for our overall business. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. When we determine that the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, we measure any impairment based upon a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate we determine to be commensurate with the risk involved. Our primary indefinite-lived intangible assets are our FCC licenses. We test investments in our FCC licenses for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that our FCC licenses may be impaired. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value with the carrying value. We segregate our FCC licenses by regional clusters for the purpose of performing the impairment test as each geographical region is unique. Valuation of Common Stock Historically, we have assessed the value of our Common Stock at the end of each reporting period for the purpose of determining stock compensation on variable stock options. This valuation was also used to determine deferred compensation expense, if any, on non-variable stock option awards granted in the period, as well as for purposes of determining whether a beneficial conversion feature was in existence at each draw date of our Series D Preferred Stock. Factors we considered were recent sales of stock to third-parties, enterprise valuation ranges provided by third parties, the liquidation preference of our outstanding preferred stock, significant milestones achieved in the business, as well as the overall economic climate of the wireless industry. Customer Recognition and Disconnect Policies When a new customer subscribes to our service, the first month of service and activation fee is included with the handset purchase. Under GAAP, we are required to allocate the purchase price to each of the handset, the first month of service and the activation fee. Generally, the amount allocated to the handset will be less than our cost, and this difference is included in Cost Per Gross Addition (“CPGA”). We recognize new customers as gross additions upon activation of service. At December 31, 2004, we offered our customers the MetroPCS Promise, which allows a customer to return a newly purchased handset for a full refund prior to the earlier of seven days or 60 minutes of use. Customers who return their phones under the MetroPCS Promise are reflected as a reduction to gross additions. Customers’ monthly service payments are due in advance every month. Our customers must pay their monthly service amount by the payment date or their service will be suspended, or hotlined, and the customer will not be able to make or receive calls on our network. However, a hotlined customer is still able to make E-911 calls in the event of an emergency. There is no service grace period. Any call attempted by a hotlined customer is routed directly to our interactive voice response system and customer service center in order to arrange payment. If the customer pays the amount due within 30 days of the original payment date then the customer’s service is restored. If a hotlined customer does not pay the amount due within 30 days of the payment date the account is disconnected and counted as churn. Once an account is disconnected, upon reactivation, we charge a $15 reconnect fee to reestablish service and the revenue associated with this fee is deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the customer. Revenues We derive our revenues from the following sources: Service. We sell broadband wireless personal communication services. The various types of service revenues associated with broadband wireless personal communication services for our customers include monthly recurring charges for airtime, monthly recurring charges for optional features (including voicemail and text messaging) and charges for long distance service. Service revenues also include intercarrier compensation and non-recurring activation service charges to customers to the extent not allocated to handset revenue. See “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Revenue Recognition.” 43 Table of Contents Equipment. We sell broadband wireless personal communication handsets and accessories that are used by our customers in connection with our wireless services. This equipment is also sold to indirect retailers to facilitate distribution to our customers. Costs and Expenses Our costs and expenses include: Cost of Service. The major components of our cost of service are: • Variable Long Distance. We pay charges to other communications companies for long distance service provided to our customers. These variable charges are based on our customers’ usage, applied at pre-negotiated rates with the long-distance carriers. • Intercarrier Compensation. We pay charges to other communications companies for their transport and termination of calls originated by our customers and destined for customers of other networks. These variable charges are based on our customers’ usage and generally applied at pre-negotiated rates with other carriers, although some carriers have sought to impose such charges unilaterally. • Cell Site Costs. We incur expenses for the rent of towers, network facilities, engineering operations, field technicians and related utility and maintenance charges. Cost of Equipment. We purchase broadband wireless personal communication handsets and accessories from third-party vendors to resell to our customers and indirect retailers in connection with our services. We subsidize the sale of handsets to encourage the sale and use of our services. We do not manufacture any of this equipment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling expense includes advertising and promotional costs associated with marketing and selling to new customers and fixed charges such as store rent and retail associates’ salaries. General and administrative expense includes support functions including, customer care, billing, technical operations, finance, accounting, human resources, information technology and legal services. We record compensation expense associated with employee stock options issued below estimated fair market value at the date of grant. In addition, we record compensation expense at the end of each reporting period with respect to our variable stock options. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service, which are ten years for network infrastructure assets and capitalized interest, three to seven years for office equipment, which includes computer equipment, and three to seven years for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the respective leases, which includes renewal periods that are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense consists of interest on our FCC notes based on an estimated fair market borrowing rate at the time of issuance, of which 6.5% is paid in cash, and interest on our Senior Notes. Interest income is earned primarily on our cash and cash equivalents. Income Taxes. As a result of our operating losses and accelerated depreciation available under federal tax laws, we have paid no federal income taxes through the end of 2004. In addition, we have paid an immaterial amount of state income tax through the end of 2004. 44 Table of Contents Set forth below is a summary of certain key performance indicators for the periods indicated: 2004 2003 Change (Restated) Customers: End of period 1,398,732 976,899 43 % Net additions 421,833 463,415 (9 )% Churn: Average monthly rate 4.92 % 4.63 % 6 % ARPU $ 41.13 $ 37.49 10 % CPGA $ 103.78 $ 100.46 3 % Customers. Net customer additions were approximately 422,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, bringing our total customers to approximately 1.4 million as of December 31, 2004, an increase of 43% over the total customers as of December 31, 2003. This increase was predominately due to the continued demand for our service offering. Churn. The average monthly rate of customer turnover (“churn”) was 4.92% and 4.63% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Average monthly churn represents (a) the number of customers who have been disconnected from our system during the measurement period less the number of customers who have reactivated service, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. When calculating churn, other wireless carriers in the U.S. typically do not count customers that discontinue service in the first 30 days as churn and do not classify delinquent customers as churn until they have been delinquent for at least 90 days. In contrast, we immediately recognize a customer who disconnects after the seven day refund period as churn and classifies delinquent customers as churn after they have been delinquent for 30 days. In addition, when an existing customer establishes a new account in connection with the purchase of an upgraded phone and does not identify themselves as an existing customer, we count that phone leaving service as a churn and the new phone entering service as a gross addition. Average Revenue Per User. Average revenue per user (“ARPU”) was $41.13 and $37.49 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. ARPU represents (a) service revenues less activation revenues, E-911, FUSF and Vendor’s Compensation charges for the measurement period, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. The $3.64, or 10%, increase in ARPU was primarily the result of successfully attracting our customers to higher priced service plans, which also include unlimited nationwide long distance for $40 per month as well as unlimited nationwide long distance and certain other services and features on an unlimited basis for $45 per month. For more detail regarding our calculation of ARPU, refer to “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Cost Per Gross Addition. Cost per gross addition (“CPGA”) was $103.78 and $100.46 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The $3.32, or 3%, increase in CPGA was the result of a decrease in activation fees revenue partially offset by lower per unit handset subsidies. CPGA is determined by dividing (a) selling expenses plus the total cost of equipment associated with transactions with new customers less activation revenues and equipment revenues associated with transactions with new customers during the measurement period by (b) gross customer additions during such period. Retail customer service expenses and equipment margin on handsets sold to existing customers, including handset upgrade transactions, are excluded, as these costs are incurred specifically for existing customers. For more detail regarding our calculation of CPGA, refer to “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. 45 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Set forth below is a summary of certain financial information for the periods indicated: 2004 2003 Change (Restated)(in thousands) Revenues Service revenue $ 616,401 $ 369,851 67 % Equipment revenues 131,849 81,258 62 % Cost of service (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below) 200,806 122,211 64 % Cost of equipment 221,217 150,832 47 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 133,059 94,073 41 % Depreciation and amortization 62,201 42,428 47 % Interest expense 19,030 11,115 71 % Provision for income taxes 47,000 16,179 191 % Net income 64,890 15,358 323 % Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our total revenues increased $297.1 million, or 66%, to $748.2 million from $451.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Service revenues accounted for 82% of total revenues and equipment revenues accounted for 18% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004. Service revenues increased $246.5 million, or 67%, to $616.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $369.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase is mainly attributable to the addition of approximately 422,000 subscribers during 2004 as well as a 10% increase in average revenue per user. Equipment revenues increased $50.6 million, or 62%, to $131.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was attributable to the increase in gross customer additions during the year of approximately 1.1 million as well as upgrade sales to our existing customers due to the increased number of handsets models available for purchase during 2004. Cost of Service. Cost of service increased $78.6 million, or 64%, to $200.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $122.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was attributable to the addition of approximately 422,000 subscribers during the year, in line with the increase in service revenues. Additionally, employee costs, cell site and switch facility lease expense and repair and maintenance expense increased as a result of the growth of our business and the expansion of our network. Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment increased $70.4 million, or 47%, to $221.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $150.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in cost of equipment was due to a slight increase in the average handset cost per unit which related to an increase in sales of higher priced handset models in 2004. In addition, we experienced an increase in the number of handsets sold to new customers during the year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $39.0 million, or 41%, to $133.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $94.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Selling, general and administrative expenses include non-cash compensation expense, which increased $4.8 million, or 87%, to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily related to the extension of the exercise period of stock options for a terminated employee in the amount of approximately $3.6 million. The remaining increase was a result of an increase in the estimated fair market value of our stock used for valuing stock options accounted for under variable accounting. Selling expenses increased by $8.6 million as a result of increased sales and marketing activities. General and administrative expenses increased by $25.6 million primarily due to the increase in our administrative costs associated with our customer base and to network expansion, a $8.1 million increase in professional fees including legal and accounting services, a $3.7 million increase in employee salaries and benefits, a $3.6 million increase in bank service charges, a $0.5 million increase in rent expense, a $1.2 million increase in personal property tax expense, and a $1.1 million increase in property insurance. Of the $8.1 million increase in 46 Table of Contents professional fees, approximately $3.2 million was related to the preparation of a registration statement for an initial public offering of our Common Stock to the public. These costs were expensed, as this initial public offering was not completed and the registration statement has been withdrawn. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $19.8 million, or 47%, to $62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $42.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase related primarily to an increase in network infrastructure assets placed into service in 2004. In-service base stations and switching equipment increased by $243.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2004. In addition, we had 457 more cell sites in service at December 31, 2004 than at December 31, 2003. We expect depreciation to continue to increase due to the additional cell sites, switches and other network equipment that we plan to place in service to meet future customer growth and usage. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $7.9 million, or 71%, to $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to interest expense on our $150.0 million Senior Notes that were issued in September 2003. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for year ended December 31, 2004 increased to $47.0 million, which is approximately 42% of our income before provision for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2003 the provision for income taxes was $16.2 million, or approximately 51% of income before provision for income taxes. The increase in our income tax expense in 2004 was attributable to our increased operating profits. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2003 to 2004 relates primarily to the increase in book income which lowers the effective rate of tax items included in the calculation. In addition, the 2003 income tax provision includes a charge required under California law to partially reduce the 2003 California net operating loss carryforwards. However, this statutory requirement did not exist in 2004. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Set forth below is a summary of certain financial information for the periods indicated: 2003 2002 Change (Restated) (Restated) (in thousands) Revenues Service revenue $ 369,851 $ 102,293 262 % Equipment revenues 81,258 27,048 200 % Cost of service (excluding depreciation included below) 122,211 63,567 92 % Cost of equipment 150,832 106,508 42 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 94,073 55,161 71 % Depreciation and amortization 42,428 21,472 98 % Interest expense 11,115 6,720 65 % Provision for income taxes 16,179 25,528 (37 )% Net income 15,358 130,305 (88 )% Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2003, our total revenues increased $321.8 million, or 249%, to $451.1 million from $129.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Service revenues accounted for 82% of total revenues and equipment revenues accounted for 18% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003. Service revenues increased $267.6 million, or 262%, to $369.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $102.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was attributable to the timing of the commercial launch of our market clusters and a 268% increase in the average number of our customers. We launched service in the Miami, Atlanta and Sacramento metropolitan areas in the first quarter of 2002, and in the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose metropolitan area in September 2002. We launched commercial operations on the west coast of Southern Florida in October 2003. Equipment revenues increased $54.2 million, or 200%, to $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was attributable to a 43% increase in gross additions and a 99% increase in revenue per handset, and $12.0 million of upgrade sales to our existing customers. In 2002, we offered only one handset model to new customers. 47 Table of Contents Cost of Service. Cost of service increased $58.6 million, or 92%, to $122.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $63.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was attributable to the timing of the commercial launch of our market clusters and the increase in our number of customers, which resulted in a $16.1 million increase in interconnect fees, a $12.9 million increase in call center expenses, a $7.7 million increase in billing expenses, a $6.5 million increase in long distance costs, and a $6.2 million increase in E-911 fees. Additionally, employee costs, cell site and switch facility lease expense and repair and maintenance expense increased as a result of the growth of our business and the expansion of our network. Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment increased $44.3 million, or 42%, to $150.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $106.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was due to a 66% increase in the number of handsets sold offset by a 7% reduction in average handset cost per unit. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $38.9 million, or 71%, to $94.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses includes non-cash compensation expense which increased $4.1 million, or 267%, to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was a result of an increase in the estimated fair market value of our stock used for valuing stock options accounted for under variable accounting. Selling expenses increased by approximately $17.8 million as a result of increased sales and marketing activities. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $18.8 million primarily due to the increase in our customer base and to network expansion, including a $5.8 million increase in transaction fees for customer collections, a $2.1 million increase in handset repair fees, a $3.4 million increase in employee salaries and benefits, a $1.5 million increase in maintenance agreements for our network facilities, a $1.5 million increase in property insurance, and a $1.1 million increase in professional fees. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $20.9 million, or 98%, to $42.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase related primarily to an increase in network infrastructure assets placed in service due to the timing of the commercial launch of our market clusters. In-service base stations and switching equipment increased by $133.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2003. In addition, we had 142 more cell sites in service at December 31, 2003 than at December 31, 2002. We expect depreciation to continue to increase due to the additional cell sites, switches and other network equipment that we plan to place in service to meet future customer growth and usage. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $4.4 million, or 65%, to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily attributable to interest expense on our $150.0 million Senior Notes that were issued in September 2003. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for year ended December 31, 2003 decreased to $16.2 million, which is approximately 51% of our income before provision for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2002 the provision for income taxes was $25.5 million, or approximately 16% of income before provision for income taxes. The decrease in our income tax expense in 2003 was attributable to our decreased operating profits. The increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2003 was attributable to a $39.7 million release of the valuation allowance that was recorded against income tax expense in 2002. We have been able to take advantage of accelerated depreciation available under federal tax law in 2002 and 2003, which has created a significant deferred tax liability. The reversal of the timing differences which gave rise to the deferred tax liability, future taxable income and future tax planning strategies will allow us to benefit from the deferred tax assets. As such, most of the valuation allowance was released in 2002. 48 Table of Contents Set forth below is a summary of certain key performance indicators for the periods indicated: 2003 2002 Change (Restated) (Restated) Customers: End of period 976,899 513,484 90 % Net additions 463,415 513,484 (10 )% Churn: Average monthly rate 4.63 % 4.45 % 4 % ARPU $ 37.49 $ 39.23 (4 )% CPGA $ 100.46 $ 157.02 (36 )% Customers. Net customer additions were approximately 463,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, bringing our total customers to approximately 977,000 as of December 31, 2003, an increase of 90% over our total customers as of December 31, 2002. This increase was due to the timing of our commercial launch and the continued demand for our service offering. Churn. The average monthly churn rate was 4.63% and 4.45% for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Average Revenue Per User. ARPU was $37.49 and $39.23 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $1.74, or 4%, decrease in ARPU was primarily the result of an increase in customers that did not pay for service while in hotlined status. For more detail regarding our calculation of ARPU, refer to “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Cost Per Gross Addition. CPGA was $100.46 and $157.02 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $56.56, or 36%, decrease in CPGA was the result of an increase in activation fees revenue as well as lower per unit handset subsidies. Equipment costs for handsets sold to existing customers, including handset upgrade transactions, are excluded from CPGA as these costs are incurred specifically for existing customers. For more detail regarding our calculation of CPGA, refer to “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Liquidity and Capital Resources The construction of our network and the marketing and distribution of our wireless communications products and services have required, and will continue to require, substantial capital investment. Capital outlays have included license acquisition costs, capital expenditures for network construction, funding of operating cash flow losses and other working capital costs, debt service and financing fees and expenses. Our aggregate capital expenditures for 2005, which were primarily associated with our efforts to increase the capacity of our network through the addition of cell sites and switches, was approximately $270 million. A portion of this amount includes the cost to begin the build out of our network for the newly acquired licensed areas in Tampa-Sarasota, Dallas and Detroit. We believe the increased service area and capacity in existing markets will improve our service offering, helping us to attract additional customers and increase revenues. In addition, we believe our new markets have attractive demographics which will result in increased revenues. We believe our cash on hand at December 31, 2005 and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital requirements for the foreseeable future. Although we estimate that these funds will be sufficient to finance our continued growth, we may have additional capital requirements, which could be substantial, for future network upgrades and advances in new technology. Existing Indebtedness. At December 31, 2004, we had $185.0 million of total indebtedness, consisting of $150.0 million principal amount of our Senior Notes, $33.4 million face amount of our FCC notes, which are recorded net of unamortized original issue discount of $2.5 million, and $4.1 million of debt associated with our obligation to other carriers for the cost of clearing microwave links in areas covered by our licenses. In September 2004, the trustee of the indenture governing our Senior Notes provided notice of our failure to comply with our covenant to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and furnish to the holders of our Senior Notes, quarterly reports required to be filed pursuant to the Exchange Act. We requested waivers of any default or event of default arising from a failure by us to comply with a reporting covenant contained in the indenture relating to the 49 Table of Contents Senior Notes (“Indenture”) from a majority of our Senior Note holders and we received and accepted requisite consents to the waiver from holders of a majority of the principal amount of the Senior Notes. Accordingly, the reporting covenant was waived until the close of business on May 2, 2005. In May 2005, holders of all of the Senior Notes tendered their Senior Notes in response to the Company’s tender offer and consent solicitation. As a result, MetroPCS, Inc. executed a supplemental indenture governing the Senior Notes to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and event of default provisions in the Indenture, to amend other provisions of the Indenture, and to waive any and all defaults and events of default that may have existed under the Indenture. In May 2005, the Company accepted and purchased all of its outstanding Senior Notes. On May 31, 2005, we repaid the outstanding principal balance of $15.7 million and accrued interest of $0.1 million on debt payable to the FCC. This debt was incurred in connection with the acquisition of our original PCS licenses and had an interest rate of 6.5% and a maturity date in January 2007. The notes were secured by a first priority interest in the Company’s original PCS licenses. The repayment resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.0 million. As a result of the sales by existing shareholders as part of the tender offer made by Madison Dearborn and TA Associates, we were required to pay off the remaining payments due the carriers to whom we owe a microwave relocation cost sharing liability. We have paid or are in the process of paying off these microwave relocation liabilities. Other Long-Term Liabilities. At December 31, 2004, we had approximately $21.4 million in other long-term liabilities, which is mostly comprised of a reserve for uncertain tax positions, compared to $27.0 million at December 31, 2003. The primary cause of the decrease was a reduction of $8.5 million in liabilities to certain network equipment providers, offset by an increase in asset retirement obligations of approximately $0.8 million. Historical Cash Flow. As of December 31, 2004, we had $22.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $68.4 million at December 31, 2003. Cash provided by operating activities was $150.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of our net income of $64.9 million and $127.9 million of non-cash charges consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization, deferred expenses, accretion of interest and non-cash compensation, offset by $42.4 million used in cash due to changes in working capital. Cash used in investing activities was $190.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily relating to capital expenditures associated with increasing the service coverage and capacity of our network and the purchase of additional FCC licenses, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of investments. Cash used in financing activities was $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily relating to the repayment of debt to the FCC. As of December 31, 2003, we had $68.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $60.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2002. Cash provided by operating activities was $112.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2003 as a result of our net income of $15.3 million and $73.6 million of non-cash charges consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization, deferred expenses, accretion of interest and non-cash compensation, and $23.7 million of cash provided by changes in working capital. Cash used in investing activities was $306.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily relating to capital expenditures associated with increasing the capacity of our network and the purchase of short-term investments. Cash provided by financing activities was $201.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily relating to the net proceeds from the sale of our Senior Notes of $145.5 million and the sale of our Series D Preferred Stock of $65.5 million. As of December 31, 2002, we had $60.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $42.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2001. Cash used in operating activities was $50.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2002 as a result of our net income of $130.3 million, $60.8 million of cash provided by changes in working capital and $37.8 million of non-cash charges consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, accretion of interest, and non-cash compensation, offset by $279.6 million gain on disposal of assets, $279.0 million of which resulted from our sale of spectrum, the proceeds of which are included in investing cash flows. Cash used by investing activities was $88.3 million during the year ending December 31, 2002, related to capital expenditures associated with our network build-out, offset by $141.2 million of proceeds on our sale of spectrum. Cash provided by financing activities was $157.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily relating to proceeds from the sale of our Series D Preferred Stock. 50 Table of Contents We have realized significant increases in cash flows from operating activities during 2004 as the scale of our business and the size of our customer base have grown. While we believe that our current business will continue to generate increasing cash flows from operating activities in the long-term, accelerated near-term growth could adversely affect operating cash flows as a result of the costs required to attract new customers, including handset subsidies and increased advertising and marketing expenses. As a result of our growth strategy, our cash flows from operating activities for 2005 may decline as compared to recent historical periods. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table provides aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Payments Due by Period Total Less Than1 Year 1 – 3Years 3 – 5Years More Than5 Years (in thousands) Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt, including current portion $ 187,470 $ 14,310 $ 19,157 $ 1,110 $ 152,893 Interest expense on long-term debt (1) 112,659 18,060 33,507 32,680 28,412 Operating leases 334,223 39,471 82,215 83,022 129,515 Total cash contractual obligations $ 634,352 $ 71,841 $ 134,879 $ 116,812 $ 310,820 (1) Interest expense on long-term debt includes future interest payments on outstanding obligations for FCC notes, $150 million Senior Notes, and microwave clearing obligations. As noted above, on May 31, 2005, we repaid all outstanding debt payable to the FCC and repurchased all of our outstanding Senior Notes. Inflation We believe that inflation has not materially affected our operations. Effect of New Accounting Standards In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” (FIN No. 46(R)), which replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” (FIN No. 46). FIN No. 46(R) clarifies and expands current accounting guidance for variable interest entities. FIN No. 46 and FIN No. 46(R) are effective immediately for all variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and for variable interest entities prior to February 1, 2003, no later than the end of the first reporting period after March 15, 2004. The adoption of FIN No. 46 and FIN No. 46 (R) did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”). SFAS No. 123(R) requires all entities to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments, including stock options granted to employees. SFAS No. 123(R) replaces SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB No. 25 and its related interpretations. This statement will be effective for awards granted, modified or settled in interim periods or fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We are currently in the process of evaluating the effect of SFAS No. 123(R). In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47 which serves as an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” (“FIN No. 47”). FIN No. 47 clarifies that the term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in SFAS No. 143 refers to an unconditional legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. Under FIN No. 47, an entity is 51 Table of Contents required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty about the timing or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. FIN No. 47 is effective for the year ended December 31, 2005. We have concluded that the adoption of FIN No. 47 will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections - a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3” (“SFAS No. 154”). SFAS No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes” (“APB No. 20”), and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.” SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effects of the change. APB No. 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principles be recognized by including in net income in the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. This standard generally will not apply with respect to the adoption of new accounting standards, as new accounting standards usually include specific transition provisions, and will not override transition provisions contained in new or existing accounting literature. SFAS No. 154 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005, and early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and error corrections made in years beginning after the date that SFAS No. 154 was issued. We have not completed our evaluation of the effect of SFAS No. 154. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140,” (“SFAS No. 155”). SFAS No. 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation, clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 133, establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives, and amends SFAS No. 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. We have not completed our evaluation of the effect of SFAS No. 155. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140,” (“SFAS No. 156”). This Statement amends SFAS No. 140 to require that all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. This Statement permits, but does not require, the subsequent measurement of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value. Under this Statement, an entity can elect subsequent fair value measurement to account for its separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. Adoption of this Statement is required as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. We have not completed our evaluation of the effect of SFAS No. 156. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows; or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented. We believe average revenue per user, or ARPU, is a useful measure to evaluate our per-customer service revenue realization and to assist in forecasting our future service revenues. ARPU is calculated exclusive of activation revenues, as these amounts are a component of our costs of acquiring new customers and are included in our calculation of CPGA. ARPU is also calculated exclusive of E-911 and Federal Universal Service Fund (“FUSF”) charges, as these are generally pass through charges that we collect from our customers and remit to the appropriate government agencies. ARPU also excludes vendor’s compensation revenue related to rebates received from certain states for collecting and remitting taxes. 52 Table of Contents Average number of customers for any measurement period is determined by dividing (a) the sum of the average monthly number of customers for the measurement period by (b) the number of months in such period. Average monthly number of customers for any month represents the sum of the number of customers on the first day of the month and the last day of the month divided by two. The following table shows the calculation of ARPU for the periods indicated: Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (Restated) (Restated) (in thousands, except average number ofcustomers and ARPU) Service revenues $ 616,401 $ 369,851 $ 102,293 Less: Activation revenues 7,874 14,410 3,018 E-911, FUSF and Vendor’s Compensation charges 12,522 6,527 — Net service revenues $ 596,005 $ 348,914 $ 99,275 Divided by: Average number of customers 1,207,521 775,605 210,881 Average revenue per user (ARPU) $ 41.13 $ 37.49 $ 39.23 We utilize CPGA to assess the efficiency of our distribution strategy, validate the initial capital invested in our customers and determine the number of months to recover our customer acquisition costs. This measure also provides a gauge to compare our average acquisition costs per new customer to those of other wireless communications providers. Activation revenues and equipment revenues related to new customers are deducted from selling costs in this calculation as they represent amounts paid by customers at the time their service is activated which reduce our acquisition cost of those customers. Additionally, equipment costs associated with existing customers, net of the related revenues, are excluded as this measure is intended to reflect only the acquisition costs related to new customers. The following table shows the calculation of CPGA for the periods indicated: Cost Per Gross Addition (CPGA) Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (Restated) (Restated) (in thousands, except gross customeradditions and CPGA) Selling expenses $ 52,605 $ 44,006 $ 26,228 Less: Activation revenues 7,874 14,410 3,018 Less: Equipment revenues 131,849 81,258 27,048 Add: Equipment revenue not associated with new customers 54,323 13,228 482 Add: Cost of equipment 221,217 150,832 106,508 Less: Equipment costs not associated with new customers 70,651 22,549 4,850 Gross addition expenses $ 117,771 $ 89,849 $ 98,302 Divided by: Gross customer additions 1,134,762 894,348 626,050 Cost per gross addition (CPGA) $ 103.78 $ 100.46 $ 157.02 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, including interest rates. We do not routinely enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading, speculative or hedging purposes. We do not currently conduct business internationally, so we are generally not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. 53 Table of Contents Prior to May 31, 2005, our outstanding indebtedness associated with the Senior Notes accrued interest at fixed rates. On February 22, 2005, we entered into a bridge loan facility that provided for floating interest rates. On May 31, 2005, we entered into secured credit facilities that provided for floating interest rates and repaid the Senior Notes, the FCC Debt and the bridge loan. Our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2005 bears interest at floating rates tied to a fixed spread to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate. The interest rate on the outstanding debt under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2005 were 8.25% for the First Lien Credit Agreement and 10.75% for the Second Lien Credit Agreement (together, the “Credit Agreements”). As of December 31, 2005, there was $900.0 million outstanding under the Credit Agreements. If market interest rates increase 100 basis points in 2006 over the rates in effect at December 31, 2005, interest expense would increase $9.0 million. In June 2005, the Company entered into a three-year interest rate cap agreement, as required by the Credit Agreements, to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on $450.0 million of the debt outstanding under the Credit Agreements. The Company paid $1.9 million upon execution of the three-year interest rate cap agreement.",2023-12-30 17:43:40.947923

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Company Overview Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are those of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. and Royal Street Communications, LLC. References to “MetroPCS,” “MetroPCS Communications,” “our Company,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer to MetroPCS Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. We are a wireless telecommunications carrier that currently offers wireless broadband mobile services primarily in the greater Atlanta, Boston, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Orlando/Jacksonville, Philadelphia, Sacramento, San Francisco and Tampa/Sarasota metropolitan areas. In 2005, Royal Street Communications, LLC, or Royal Street Communications, and with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, or collectively, Royal Street, was granted licenses by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, in Los Angeles and various metropolitan areas throughout northern Florida. We own 85% of the limited liability company member interest in Royal Street Communications, but may only elect two of the five members of Royal Street Communications’ management committee. We have a wholesale arrangement with Royal Street under which we purchase up to 85% of the engineered capacity of Royal Street’s systems allowing us to sell our standard products and services under the MetroPCS brand to the public. Additionally, upon Royal Street’s request, we have provided and will provide financing to Royal Street under a loan agreement. As of December 31, 2009, the maximum amount that Royal Street could borrow from us under the loan agreement was approximately $1.6 billion of which Royal Street had net outstanding borrowings of approximately $1.1 billion through December 31, 2009. On February 17, 2010, we executed an amendment to the loan agreement, which increased the amount available to Royal Street under the loan agreement by an additional $874.0 million. Royal Street has incurred an additional $14.0 million in net borrowings through February 28, 2010. As a result of the significant growth we have experienced since we launched operations, our results of operations to date are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected in future periods. Moreover, we expect that our number of customers will continue to increase, which will continue to contribute to increases in our revenues and operating expenses. We sell products and services to customers through our Company-owned retail stores as well as indirectly through relationships with independent retailers. We offer service which allows our customers to place unlimited local calls from within our local service area and to receive unlimited calls from any area while in our local service area, under simple and affordable flat-rate monthly service plans. In 2009, our service plans started at $30 per month and the subscriber was obligated to pay all applicable taxes and regulatory fees associated with the service. In January 2010, we introduced a new family of service plans, which include all applicable taxes and regulatory fees, offering nationwide voice, text and web services beginning at $40 per month. For an additional $5 to $20 per month, our customers may select alternative service plans that offer additional features on an unlimited basis. For additional usage fees, we also provide certain other value-added services. All of these plans require payment in advance for one month of service. If no payment is made in advance for the following month of service, service is suspended at the end of the month that was paid for by the customer and, if the customer does not pay within thirty days, the customer is terminated. Our flat-rate plans differentiate our service from the more complex plans and long-term contract requirements of traditional wireless carriers. In addition, the above products and services are offered by us under the MetroPCS brand in the metropolitan areas where we purchase services from Royal Street. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. You should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Our wireless services are provided on a month-to-month basis and are paid in advance. We recognize revenues from wireless services as they are rendered. Amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Suspending service for non-payment is known as hotlining. We do not recognize revenue on hotlined customers. Revenues and related costs from the sale of accessories are recognized at the point of sale. The cost of handsets sold to indirect retailers are included in deferred charges until they are sold to and activated by customers. Amounts billed to indirect retailers for handsets are recorded as accounts receivable and deferred revenue upon shipment by us and are recognized as equipment revenues when service is activated by customers. Our customers have the right to return handsets within a specified time or within a certain amount of use, whichever occurs first. We record an estimate for returns as contra-revenue at the time of recognizing revenue. Our assessment of estimated returns is based on historical return rates. If our customers’ actual returns are not consistent with our estimates of their returns, revenues may be different than initially recorded. We have revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and follow the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 605, (Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition”). ASC 605 addresses the accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting and the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the residual method of accounting. We determined that the sale of wireless services through our direct and indirect sales channels with an accompanying handset constitutes revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. In accordance with ASC 605 we divide these arrangements into separate units of accounting and allocate the consideration between the handset and the wireless service using the residual method of accounting. Consideration received for the wireless service is recognized at fair value as service revenue when earned, and any remaining consideration received is recognized as equipment revenue when the handset is activated by the customer. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our independent retailers to pay for equipment purchases and for amounts estimated to be uncollectible for intercarrier compensation. We estimate allowances for uncollectible accounts from independent retailers based on the length of time the receivables are past due, the current business environment and our historical experience. If the financial condition of a material portion of our independent retailers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific carrier’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record a specific allowance for intercarrier compensation against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. Total allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable as of December 31, 2009 was approximately 4% of the total amount of gross accounts receivable. Inventories We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value or replacement cost based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Total inventory reserves for obsolescent and unmarketable inventory were not significant as of December 31, 2009. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Deferred Income Tax Asset and Other Tax Reserves We assess our deferred tax asset and record a valuation allowance, when necessary, to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future taxable income, taxable temporary differences and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period we made that determination. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax returns are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and ultimately modified. We adjust the reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of income tax related reserve positions and changes to income tax reserves that we consider appropriate. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is finally resolved. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash or a reduction in our net operating loss carryforwards. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the effective rate in the year of resolution. Tax reserves as of December 31, 2009 were $12.6 million of which $5.5 million and $7.1 million are presented on the consolidated balance sheet in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. Property and Equipment Depreciation on property and equipment is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service, which are seven to ten years for network infrastructure assets, three to ten years for capitalized interest, up to fifteen years for capital lease assets, three to eight years for office equipment, which includes software and computer equipment, three to seven years for furniture and fixtures and five years for vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease and any renewal periods reasonably assured or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. The estimated life of property and equipment is based on historical experience with similar assets, as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. If technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation expense in future periods. Likewise, if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than anticipated, the life of the assets could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to property and equipment. This could result in a reduction of depreciation expense in future periods. We assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or in the strategy for our overall business. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. When we determine that the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, we measure any impairment based upon a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate we determine to be commensurate with the risk involved and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge associated with long-lived assets. There have been no indicators that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable and accordingly no impairment tests have been performed. The carrying value of property and equipment was approximately $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2009. Fair Value Measurements We have adopted the provisions of ASC 820 (Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”) for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 became effective for financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008. We adopted the provisions of ASC 820 for non-financial assets and liabilities upon its effectiveness on January 1, 2009. ASC 820 defines fair value, thereby eliminating inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements, and increases disclosures surrounding fair value calculations. ASC 820 establishes a three-tiered fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. ASC 820 requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation. 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements FCC Licenses and Microwave Relocation Costs We operate wireless broadband mobile networks under licenses granted by the FCC for a particular geographic area on spectrum allocated by the FCC for terrestrial wireless broadband mobile services. We hold personal communications services, or PCS, licenses granted or acquired on various dates, and in November 2006, we acquired a number of AWS licenses which can be used to provide wireless broadband mobile services comparable to PCS services provided by us, as well as other advanced wireless services. In June 2008, we acquired a 700 MHz license that also can be used to provide services comparable to those we can provide over our AWS spectrum. The PCS licenses previously included, and the AWS licenses currently include, the obligation to relocate existing fixed microwave users of our licensed spectrum if the use of our spectrum interfered with their systems and/or reimburse other carriers (according to FCC rules) that relocated prior users if the relocation benefits our system. Additionally, we incurred costs related to microwave relocation in constructing our PCS and AWS networks. The PCS, AWS and 700 MHz licenses and microwave relocation costs are recorded at cost. Although FCC licenses are issued with a stated term, ten years in the case of PCS licenses, fifteen years in the case of AWS licenses and ten years for 700 MHz licenses, the renewal of PCS, AWS and 700 MHz licenses is generally a routine matter without substantial cost and we have determined that no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors currently exist that limit the useful life of our PCS, AWS and 700 MHz licenses. Our primary indefinite-lived intangible assets are our PCS, AWS and 700 MHz licenses and microwave relocation costs. Based on the requirements of ASC 350 (Topic 350, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other”), we test investments in our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. We perform our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test as of each September 30th. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value with the carrying value. An impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related indefinite-lived intangible assets and charged to results of operations. As outlined in ASC 350, we use a direct method of valuation for our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Alternative valuation methods include the analysis of similar transactions of spectrum under the market approach and the Greenfield Methodology under the income approach. The Greenfield Methodology was utilized to provide an indication of fair value for our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Such methodology is based on the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up operation and assumes that the only assets upon formation are the underlying FCC licenses, and that the business enterprise does not have any other assets including goodwill or going concern value at the date of inception. The start-up assumptions include utilization of the asset in the best possible use and incorporate marketplace participant assumptions for key factors, such as current and future technology, costs of telecommunications equipment, and workforce costs, considering the opportunities and constraints of the underlying spectrum as of the valuation date. Cash flow projections and assumptions, although subject to a degree of uncertainty, are based on a combination of our historical performance and trends, our business plans and management’s estimate of future performance, giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive economic conditions. Other assumptions include a weighted average cost of capital and long-term rate of growth for our business. We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use to estimate fair value. We corroborate our determination of fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, using the discounted cash flow approach described above, with other market-based valuation metrics. As of September 30, 2009, our indefinite-lived intangible assets were aggregated and combined into a single unit of accounting in accordance with ASC 350 based on the management of the business on a national scope. We believe that utilizing our indefinite-lived intangible assets as a group represents the highest and best use of the assets, and the value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets would not be significantly impacted by a sale of one or a portion of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, among other factors. Previously, our indefinite-lived intangible assets were segregated by operating segments for the purpose of performing the annual impairment test. As of September 30, 2009, in accordance with the requirements in ASC 350, these intangibles were separately tested for impairment prior to being combined as a single unit of accounting. No impairment was recognized as the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset was in excess of its carrying value as of September 30, 2009. Historically, we have not experienced significant negative variations between our assumptions and estimates when compared to actual results. However, if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge associated with indefinite-lived intangible assets. Although we do not expect our estimates or assumptions to change significantly in the future, the use of different estimates or 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets or using a methodology other than a discounted cash flow model could result in different values for our indefinite-lived intangible assets and may affect any related impairment charge. The most significant assumptions within our discounted cash flow model are the discount rate, our projected growth rate and management’s future business plans. A one percent decline in annual revenue growth rates, a one percent decline in annual net cash flows or a one percent increase in discount rate would not result in impairment related to the combined single unit of accounting as of September 30, 2009. Indefinite-lived intangible assets must be tested between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors. In light of the adverse economic and financial conditions occurring in the credit and capital markets, we considered the range of potential impacts that market conditions and economic events had on our key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our units of accounting since our last impairment test. We reviewed changes in the business climate, changes in market capitalization, legal factors, operating performance indicators and competition, among other factors. There have been no significant changes in any of these factors that have adversely affected any of the key assumptions used in our determination of fair value. Furthermore, if any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets are subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, we would test such assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360 (Topic 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment”), and the intangible assets would then be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life. For the license impairment test performed as of September 30, 2009, the aggregate fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets was in excess of the aggregate carrying values. There also have been no subsequent indicators of impairment, including those indicated in ASC 360, and accordingly no subsequent interim impairment tests were performed. Share-Based Payments We account for share-based awards exchanged for employee services in accordance with ASC 718 (Topic 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation”). Under ASC 718, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. We have granted restricted stock awards that entitle the holder to receive shares of common stock which become fully tradable upon vesting. The restricted stock awards granted generally vest on a four-year vesting schedule with 25% vesting on the first anniversary date of the award and the remainder pro-rata on a monthly or quarterly basis thereafter, subject to a service condition that relates only to vesting. The estimated compensation expense, which is equal to the fair value of the awards on the date of grant, is recognized on a ratable basis over the four-year vesting period. We have also granted nonqualified stock options. Most of our stock option awards include a service condition that relates only to vesting. The stock option awards generally vest in one to four years from the grant date. Compensation expense is amortized on a ratable basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award. The determination of the fair value of stock options using an option-pricing model is affected by our common stock valuation as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. The Board of Directors uses the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant as the fair market value for our common stock. The volatility assumption is based on a combination of the historical volatility of our common stock and the volatilities of similar companies over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock options. The volatilities of similar companies are used in conjunction with our historical volatility because of the lack of sufficient relevant history equal to the expected term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. The expected term assumption is estimated based primarily on the stock options’ vesting terms and remaining contractual life and employees’ expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on the grant date appropriate for the term of the employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the expectation of no future dividend payouts by us. 65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The value of the options is determined by using a Black-Scholes pricing model that includes the following variables: 1) exercise price of the instrument, 2) fair market value of the underlying stock on date of grant, 3) expected life, 4) estimated volatility and 5) the risk-free interest rate. We utilized the following weighted-average assumptions in estimating the fair value of the options grants for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: December 31,2009 December 31,2008 Expected dividends 0.00 % 0.00 % Expected volatility 50.01 % 45.20 % Risk-free interest rate 1.99 % 2.49 % Expected lives in years 5.00 5.00 Weighted-average fair value of options: Granted at below fair value $ — $ — Granted at fair value $ 6.43 $ 6.95 Weighted-average exercise price of options: Granted at below fair value $ — $ — Granted at fair value $ 14.23 $ 16.36 The Black-Scholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions including expectations of future dividends and stock price volatility. Such assumptions are only used for making the required fair value estimate and should not be considered as indicators of future dividend policy or stock price appreciation. Because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, and because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, the use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model may not provide a reliable estimate of the fair value of employee stock options. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award. As share-based compensation expense under ASC 718 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it is reduced for estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We recognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $47.8 million, $41.1 million and $28.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Customer Recognition and Disconnect Policies Until January 2010, when a new customer subscribed to our service, the first month of service was included with the handset purchase. Under GAAP, we are required to allocate the purchase price to the handset and to the wireless service revenue. Generally, the amount allocated to the handset will be less than our cost, and this difference is included in Cost Per Gross Addition, or CPGA. We recognize new customers as gross customer additions upon activation of service. Until January 2010 we offered our customers the Metro Promise, which allowed a customer to return a newly purchased handset for a full refund prior to the earlier of 30 days or 60 minutes of use. Customers who returned their phones under the Metro Promise are reflected as a reduction to gross customer additions. Customers’ monthly service payments are due in advance every month. Our customers must pay their monthly service amount by the payment date or their service will be suspended, or hotlined, and the customer will not be able to make or receive calls on our network. However, a hotlined customer is still able to make E-911 calls in the event of an emergency. There is no service grace period. Any call attempted by a hotlined customer is routed directly to our interactive voice response system and customer service center in order to arrange payment. If the customer pays the amount due within 30 days of the original payment date then the customer’s service is restored. If a hotlined customer does not pay the amount due within 30 days of the payment date the account is disconnected and counted as churn. Once an account is disconnected we may charge a $15 reconnect fee upon reactivation to reestablish service and the revenue associated with this fee is deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the customer. 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revenues We derive our revenues from the following sources: Service. We sell wireless broadband mobile services. The various types of service revenues associated with wireless broadband mobile for our customers include monthly recurring charges for airtime, monthly recurring charges for optional features (including nationwide long distance, unlimited international long distance, unlimited text messaging, international text messaging, voicemail, downloads, ringtones, games and content applications, unlimited directory assistance, enhanced directory assistance, ring back tones, mobile Internet browsing, mobile instant messaging, push e-mail and nationwide roaming) and charges for long distance service. Service revenues also include intercarrier compensation and nonrecurring reactivation service charges to customers. Equipment. We sell wireless broadband mobile handsets and accessories that are used by our customers in connection with our wireless services. This equipment is also sold to our independent retailers to facilitate distribution to our customers. Costs and Expenses Our costs and expenses include: Cost of Service. The major components of our cost of service are: • Cell Site Costs. We incur expenses for the rent of cell sites, network facilities, engineering operations, field technicians and related utility and maintenance charges. • Intercarrier Compensation. We pay charges to other telecommunications companies for their transport and termination of calls originated by our customers and destined for customers of other networks. These variable charges are based on our customers’ usage and generally applied at pre-negotiated rates with other carriers, although some carriers have sought to impose such charges unilaterally. • Variable Long Distance. We pay charges to other telecommunications companies for long distance service provided to our customers. These variable charges are based on our customers’ usage, applied at pre-negotiated rates with the long distance carriers. • Customer Support. We pay charges to nationally recognized third-party providers for customer care, billing and payment processing services. Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment primarily includes the cost of handsets and accessories purchased from third-party vendors to resell to our customers and independent retailers in connection with our services. We do not manufacture any of this equipment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling expenses include advertising and promotional costs associated with marketing and selling to new customers and fixed charges such as retail store rent and retail associates’ salaries. General and administrative expenses include support functions including, technical operations, finance, accounting, human resources, information technology and legal services. We record stock-based compensation expense in cost of service and in selling, general and administrative expenses for expense associated with employee stock options and restricted stock awards, which is measured at the date of grant, based on the estimated fair value of the award. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service, which are seven to ten years for network infrastructure assets, three to ten years for capitalized interest, up to fifteen years for capital leases, three to eight years for office equipment, which includes software and computer equipment, three to seven years for furniture and fixtures and five years for vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the respective leases, which includes renewal periods that are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense includes interest incurred on our borrowings and capital lease obligations, amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of discounts and premiums on long-term debt. Interest income is earned primarily on our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. 67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we paid no federal income taxes, whereas for the year ended December 31, 2007, we paid approximately $0.3 million in federal income taxes. In addition, we have paid approximately $3.1 million, $2.7 million and $1.1 million of state income tax during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Seasonality Our customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. Based on historical results, we generally expect net customer additions to be strongest in the first and fourth quarters. Softening of sales and increased customer turnover, or churn, in the second and third quarters of the year usually combine to result in fewer net customer additions. However, sales activity and churn can be strongly affected by the launch of new and surrounding metropolitan areas and promotional activity, which could reduce or outweigh certain seasonal effects.

Our chief operating decision maker is the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. As of December 31, 2009, we had thirteen operating segments based on geographic region within the United States: Atlanta, Boston, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Orlando/Jacksonville, Philadelphia, Sacramento, San Francisco and Tampa/Sarasota. Each of these operating segments provides wireless broadband mobile voice and data services and products to customers in its service areas. These services include unlimited local and long distance calling, voicemail, caller ID, call waiting, enhanced directory assistance, text messaging, picture and multimedia messaging, domestic and international long distance, international text messaging, ringtones, games and content applications, unlimited directory assistance, ring back tones, nationwide roaming, mobile Internet browsing, mobile instant messaging, push e-mail, location based services, social networking services and other value-added services. We aggregate our operating segments into two reportable segments: Core Markets and Northeast Markets. Effective January 1, 2009, we implemented a change to the composition of our reportable segments under ASC 280. The historical comparative information for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 presented below has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change. • Core Markets, which include Atlanta, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando/Jacksonville, Sacramento, San Francisco and Tampa/Sarasota, are aggregated because they are reviewed on an aggregate basis by the chief operating decision maker, they are similar in respect to their products and services, production processes, class of customer, method of distribution, and regulatory environment and currently exhibit similar financial performance and economic characteristics. 68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • Northeast Markets, which include Boston, New York and Philadelphia, are aggregated because they are reviewed on an aggregate basis by the chief operating decision maker, they are similar in respect to their products and services, production processes, class of customer, method of distribution, and regulatory environment and have similar expected long-term financial performance and economic characteristics. General corporate overhead, which includes expenses such as corporate employee labor costs, rent and utilities, legal, accounting and auditing expenses, is allocated equally across all operating segments. Corporate marketing and advertising expenses are allocated equally to the operating segments, beginning in the period during which we launch service in that operating segment. Expenses associated with our national data center and national operations center are allocated based on the average number of customers in each operating segment. There are no transactions between reportable segments. Interest and certain other expenses, interest income and income taxes are not allocated to the segments in the computation of segment operating profit for internal evaluation purposes.

Service Revenues. Service revenues increased $693.1 million, or 28%, to $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase is due to increases in Core Markets and Northeast Markets service revenues as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets service revenues increased $470.2 million, or 19%, to approximately $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in service revenues is primarily attributable to net customer additions of approximately 598 thousand customers for the year ended December 31, 2009, which accounted for approximately $497.1 million of the Core Markets increase. Offsetting these revenues, in accordance with ASC 605, is $26.9 million that would have been recognized as Core Markets service revenues but was classified as equipment revenues because the consideration received from customers was less than the fair value of promotionally priced handsets. • Northeast Markets. Northeast Markets service revenues increased $222.9 million to $235.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in service revenues is primarily attributable to net customer additions of approximately 675 thousand customers for the year ended December 31, 2009, which accounted for $238.9 million of the Northeast Markets increase. Offsetting these revenues, in accordance with ASC 605 is approximately $16.0 million that would have been recognized as Northeast Markets service revenues but was classified as equipment revenues because the consideration received from customers was less than the fair value of promotionally priced handsets. Equipment Revenues. Equipment revenues increased $35.8 million, or 11%, to $350.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $314.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase is due primarily to an increase in Northeast Markets equipment revenues, partially offset by a decrease in Core Markets equipment revenues: • Core Markets. Core Markets equipment revenues decreased approximately $9.8 million, or 3%, to $300.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $310.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in equipment revenues is primarily attributable to a lower average price of handsets activated reducing equipment revenues by approximately $61.3 million, partially offset by an increase in gross additions and an increase in upgrade handset sales to existing customers accounting for an approximate $26.3 million increase in equipment revenues. In addition, in accordance with ASC 605, $26.9 million that would have been recognized as Core Markets service revenues was classified as equipment revenues because the consideration received from customers was less than the fair value of promotionally priced handsets. • Northeast Markets. Northeast Markets equipment revenues increased approximately $45.6 million to approximately $49.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These equipment revenues are primarily attributable to the growth in the Philadelphia metropolitan area as well as the launch of service in the New York and Boston metropolitan areas in early 2009. In addition, in accordance with ASC 605, approximately $16.0 million that would have been recognized as Northeast Markets service revenues was classified as equipment revenues because the consideration received from customers was less than the fair value of promotionally priced handsets. 70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cost of Service. Cost of service increased approximately $262.8 million, or approximately 31%, to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $857.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase is due to increases in Core Markets and Northeast Markets cost of service as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets cost of service increased approximately $125.3 million, or approximately 16%, to approximately $910.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $785.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in cost of service is primarily attributable to the growth in our Core Markets customer base, the deployment of additional network infrastructure during the year ended December 31, 2009 and costs associated with our unlimited international calling product. • Northeast Markets. Northeast Markets cost of service increased approximately $137.5 million, or approximately 192%, to approximately $209.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $71.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in cost of service is primarily attributable to the growth in our Northeast Markets customer base, the deployment of additional network infrastructure during the year ended December 31, 2009 and costs associated with our unlimited international calling product. Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment increased $179.6 million, or approximately 26%, to approximately $884.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $704.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase is due to increases in Core Markets and Northeast Markets cost of equipment as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets cost of equipment increased approximately $35.3 million, or 5%, to approximately $725.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $690.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in Core Markets cost of equipment is primarily attributable to an increase in gross customer additions which accounted for approximately $22.3 million, coupled with an increase in upgrade handset costs to existing customers accounting for an approximate $39.8 million increase. These increases were partially offset by the sale of lower priced handsets accounting for an approximate $30.0 million decrease in cost of equipment. • Northeast Markets. Northeast Markets cost of equipment increased $144.3 million to $158.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This cost is primarily attributable to an increase in gross customer additions. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $120.1 million, or approximately 27%, to $567.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $447.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase is due to increases in Core Markets and Northeast Markets selling, general and administrative expenses as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $45.3 million, or approximately 12%, to approximately $435.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $389.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Selling expenses increased by $25.1 million, or approximately 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in selling expenses is primarily attributable to an approximate $9.8 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses, an approximate $7.3 million increase in employee related costs and a $6.4 million increase in MetroFLASH™ expense. General and administrative expenses increased $16.1 million, or approximately 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to the growth in the Core Markets. In addition, stock-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. See – “Stock-Based Compensation Expense.” 71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • Northeast Markets. Northeast Markets selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $74.8 million, or approximately 130%, to $132.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Selling expenses increased by $64.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase is primarily due to a $40.3 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses as well as higher employee related costs of approximately $17.2 million to support the growth in the Northeast Markets. General and administrative expenses increased by $8.7 million, or 27%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due the growth in the Northeast Markets. In addition, an increase of approximately $1.3 million in stock-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses contributed to the increase in the Northeast Markets. See – “Stock-Based Compensation Expense.” Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $122.5 million, or 48%, to $377.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $255.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase is due to increases in Core Markets and Northeast Markets depreciation and amortization expense as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $28.3 million, or 12%, to approximately $258.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $230.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase related primarily to an increase in network infrastructure assets placed into service during the year ended December 31, 2009 to support the continued growth in the Core Markets. • Northeast Markets.

Gain on disposal of assets increased approximately $23.6 million, or approximately 125%, to approximately $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from a loss on disposal of assets of $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The gain recognized during the year ended December 31, 2009 was due primarily to asset sales and FCC license exchanges consummated during the year, partially offset by the disposal of assets related to certain network technology that was retired and replaced with 72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements newer technology during the year ended December 31, 2009. The loss on disposal of assets for the year ended December 31, 2008 related to certain network equipment and construction costs that were retired. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased approximately $90.9 million, or approximately 51%, to approximately $270.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $179.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an additional $550.0 million of 9 1/4% senior notes due 2014, or New 9 1/4% Senior Notes, that were issued in January 2009 and interest on capital lease obligations that were placed into service during the year ended December 31, 2009 as well as a decrease in capitalized interest expense. In addition, our weighted average interest rate increased to 8.23% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 7.78% for the year ended December 31, 2008, which includes the impact of our interest rate protection agreements. Average debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $3.5 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income decreased approximately $20.6 million, or approximately 89%, to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in interest and other income was primarily due to a decrease on the return on our cash balances as a result of a decrease in interest rates. Impairment Loss on Investment Securities. We can and have historically invested our substantial cash balances in, among other things, securities issued and fully guaranteed by the United States or the states, highly rated commercial paper and auction rate securities, money market funds meeting certain criteria, and demand deposits. These investments are subject to credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we made an original investment of $133.9 million in principal in certain auction rate securities that were rated AAA/Aaa at the time of purchase, substantially all of which are secured by collateralized debt obligations with a portion of the underlying collateral being mortgage securities or related to mortgage securities. With the continued liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets, the auction rate securities held by us at December 31, 2009 continue to experience failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale in the auctions exceeds the amount of purchase orders. We recognized an additional other-than-temporary impairment loss on investment securities in the amount of approximately $2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense was approximately $86.8 million and approximately $130.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The effective tax rate was 32.9% and 46.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our effective rates differ from the statutory federal rate of 35.0% due to state and local taxes of $11.5 million, non-deductible expenses of $0.6 million, renewable energy investment tax credits of $2.1 million, an increase in the valuation allowance related to the impairment loss recognized on investment securities of $0.8 million and a net change in uncertain tax positions of $16.3 million. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes a net decrease in a state unrecognized tax benefit of $18.1 million due to the expiration of a statute of limitations. Net Income. Net income increased $27.4 million, or 18%, to $176.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to a 14% increase in income from operations, a 33% decrease in provision for income taxes and a 92% decrease in the impairment loss on investment securities, partially offset by an approximate 51% increase in interest expense and an approximate 89% decrease in interest and other income. 73 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Set forth below is a summary of certain financial information by reportable operating segment for the periods indicated: Reportable Operating Segment Data 2008 2007 Change (in thousands) REVENUES: Service revenues: Core Markets $ 2,424,859 $ 1,919,197 26 % Northeast Markets 12,391 — * * Total $ 2,437,250 $ 1,919,197 27 % Equipment revenues: Core Markets $ 310,452 $ 316,537 (2 )% Northeast Markets 3,814 — * * Total $ 314,266 $ 316,537 (1 )% OPERATING EXPENSES: Cost of service (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below) (1): Core Markets $ 785,595 $ 642,206 22 % Northeast Markets 71,700 5,304 * * Total $ 857,295 $ 647,510 32 % Cost of equipment: Core Markets $ 690,296 $ 597,233 16 % Northeast Markets 14,352 — * * Total $ 704,648 $ 597,233 18 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below) (1): Core Markets $ 389,896 $ 323,572 21 % Northeast Markets 57,686 28,448 103 % Total $ 447,582 $ 352,020 27 % Adjusted EBITDA (Deficit) (2): Core Markets $ 901,751 $ 694,761 30 % Northeast Markets $ (118,618 ) $ (27,766 ) 327 % Depreciation and amortization: Core Markets $ 230,603 $ 170,876 35 % Northeast Markets 6,502 319 * * Other 18,214 7,007 160 % Total $ 255,319 $ 178,202 43 % Stock-based compensation expense: Core Markets $ 32,227 $ 22,037 46 % Northeast Markets 8,915 5,987 49 % Total $ 41,142 $ 28,024 47 % Income (loss) from operations: Core Markets $ 620,024 $ 504,468 23 % Northeast Markets (134,039 ) (34,092 ) 293 % Other (18,218 ) (10,262 ) 78 % Total $ 467,767 $ 460,114 2 % ** Not meaningful (1) Cost of service and selling, general and administrative expenses include stock-based compensation expense.

Service revenues increased $518.1 million, or approximately 27%, to $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is due to increases in Core Markets and Northeast Markets service revenues as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets service revenues increased approximately $505.7 million, or 26%, to $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in service revenues is primarily attributable to net customer additions of approximately 1.3 million customers for the year ended December 31, 2008, which accounted for approximately $607.3 million of the Core Markets increase. This increase was partially offset by the higher participation in our Family Plans as well as reduced revenue from certain features included in our service plans that were previously provided a la carte, accounting for an approximately $106.6 million decrease. • Northeast Markets. Northeast Markets service revenues were approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These service revenues are attributable to net customer additions of 104,151 in the Philadelphia metropolitan area for the year ended December 31, 2008. Equipment Revenues. Equipment revenues decreased $2.3 million, or approximately 1%, to $314.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $316.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease is due primarily to a decrease in Core Markets equipment revenues, partially offset by an increase in Northeast Markets equipment revenues as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets equipment revenues decreased approximately $6.1 million, or approximately 2%, to approximately $310.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $316.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in equipment revenues is primarily attributable to a lower average price of handsets activated reducing equipment revenues by $39.9 million, partially offset by an increase in gross additions and an increase in upgrade handset sales to existing customers accounting for an approximate $30.6 million increase in equipment revenues. • Northeast Markets. Northeast Markets equipment revenues were $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These equipment revenues are attributable to gross customer additions from the launch of service in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Cost of Service. Cost of service increased $209.8 million, or approximately 32%, to $857.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $647.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is due primarily to an increase in Core Markets and Northeast Markets cost of service as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets cost of service increased approximately $143.4 million, or 22%, to approximately $785.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $642.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in cost of service is primarily attributable to the approximate 33% growth in our Core Markets customer base and the deployment of additional network infrastructure during the year ended December 31, 2008. • Northeast Markets. Northeast Markets cost of service increased approximately $66.4 million to $71.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in cost of service is primarily attributable to the expenses associated with the construction and launch of service in the Philadelphia metropolitan area and operating costs in the New York and Boston metropolitan areas that were incurred prior to the launch of service in these markets. Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment increased $107.4 million, or 18%, to $704.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $597.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is due primarily to an increase in Core Markets and Northeast Markets cost of equipment as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets cost of equipment increased approximately $93.1 million, or approximately 16%, to approximately $690.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $597.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in Core Markets cost of equipment is primarily attributable to an increase in gross customer additions which accounted for approximately $73.5 million, coupled with an increase in upgrade handset sales to existing customers accounting for approximately $38.8 million. These increases were partially offset by a lower average cost of handsets activated reducing cost of equipment by $27.7 million. 75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • Northeast Markets. Northeast Markets cost of equipment were approximately $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This cost is attributable to gross customer additions from the launch of service in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $95.6 million, or 27%, to $447.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $352.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is due to increases in Core Markets and Northeast Markets selling, general and administrative expenses as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets selling, general and administrative expenses increased $66.3 million, or approximately 21%, to approximately $389.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from approximately $323.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Selling expenses increased by approximately $42.8 million, or 28%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in selling expenses is primarily attributable to a $16.6 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses as well as higher employee related costs of approximately $14.5 million incurred to support the growth in the Core Markets. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $14.1 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This was due primarily to the approximate 33% growth in our Core Markets customer base. In addition, stock-based compensation expense increased $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007. See – “Stock-Based Compensation Expense.” • Northeast Markets. Northeast Markets selling, general and administrative expenses increased $29.3 million, or approximately 103%, to approximately $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from approximately $28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Selling expenses increased by $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase is primarily due to a $7.0 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses incurred to support the launch of service in the Philadelphia metropolitan area as well as higher employee related costs of approximately $6.4 million to support the launch of service in the Philadelphia metropolitan area and the build-out of the New York and Boston metropolitan areas. General and administrative expenses increased by $10.2 million, or 46%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily due to the construction and launch of service in the Philadelphia market and the build-out of the New York and Boston metropolitan areas. In addition, an increase of $2.6 million in stock-based compensation expense contributed to the increase in the Northeast Markets. See – “Stock-Based Compensation Expense.” Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $77.1 million, or 43%, to $255.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $178.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is primarily due to increases in Core Markets and Northeast Markets depreciation and amortization expense as follows: • Core Markets. Core Markets depreciation and amortization expense increased $59.7 million, or 35%, to $230.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from approximately $170.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase related primarily to an increase in network infrastructure assets placed into service during the year ended December 31, 2008 to support the continued growth in the Core Markets. • Northeast Markets. Northeast Markets depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $6.2 million to $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase related primarily to an increase in network infrastructure assets placed into service during the year ended December 31, 2008 driven primarily by the launch of service in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Stock-Based Compensation Expense. Stock-based compensation expense increased $13.1 million, or approximately 47%, to $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is due primarily to increases in Core Markets and Northeast Markets stock-based compensation expense as follows: 76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • Core Markets. Core Markets stock-based compensation expense increased approximately $10.2 million, or 46%, to $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is primarily related to additional stock options granted to employees in these markets throughout the year ended December 31, 2008. • Northeast Markets. Northeast Markets stock-based compensation expense increased $2.9 million, or approximately 49%, to $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from approximately $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is primarily related to additional stock options granted to employees in these markets throughout the year ended December 31, 2008. Consolidated Data 2008 2007 Change (in thousands) Loss on disposal of assets $ 18,905 $ 655 ** Interest expense 179,398 201,746 (11 )% Interest and other income (23,170 ) (63,936 ) (64 )% Impairment loss on investment securities 30,857 97,800 (68 )% Provision for income taxes 129,986 123,098 6 % Net income 149,438 100,403 49 % ** Not meaningful. Loss on Disposal of Assets. Loss on disposal of assets increased $18.3 million to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a loss on disposal of assets related to certain network equipment and construction costs that were retired. The majority of the loss was related to the transfer of network switching equipment to a new location which resulted in the write-off of the associated construction and installation costs and certain other network equipment that had no future value to the new location. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $22.3 million, or 11%, to $179.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $201.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the capitalization of $64.2 million of interest during the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, compared to $34.9 million of interest capitalized during the same period in 2007. We capitalize interest costs associated with our FCC licenses and property and equipment during the construction of a new market. The amount of such capitalized interest depends on the carrying values of the FCC licenses and construction in progress involved in those markets and the duration of the construction process. We expect capitalized interest to be significant during the construction of new markets. In addition, our weighted average interest rate decreased to 7.78% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 compared to 8.15% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 as a result of a decrease in the borrowing rates under the senior secured credit facility. Average debt outstanding for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $3.0 and $2.8 billion, respectively. The increase in average debt outstanding was due to the issuance of an additional $400.0 million principal amount of our 9 1/4% senior notes due 2014, or additional notes, in June 2007. Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income decreased $40.7 million, or approximately 64%, to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $63.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in interest and other income was primarily due to the Company investing substantially all of its cash and cash equivalents in money market funds consisting of U.S. Treasury securities rather than in short-term investments as the Company has done historically. In addition, interest income decreased due to lower cash balances when compared to 2007 as well as a decrease on the return on our cash balances as a result of a decrease in interest rates. Impairment Loss on Investment Securities. We can and have historically invested our substantial cash balances in, among other things, securities issued and fully guaranteed by the United States or the states, highly rated commercial paper and auction rate securities, money market funds meeting certain criteria, and demand deposits. These investments are subject to credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we made an original investment of $133.9 million in principal in certain auction rate securities that were rated AAA/Aaa at the time of purchase, substantially all of which are secured by collateralized debt obligations with a portion of the underlying collateral being mortgage securities or related to mortgage securities. With the continued liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets, the auction rate securities held by us at December 31, 2008 continue to experience failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale in the auctions exceeds the amount of purchase orders. We recognized an additional other-than-temporary impairment loss on investment securities in the amount of $30.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. 77 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense was $130.0 million and $123.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective tax rate was 46.5% and 54.4% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our effective rates differ from the statutory federal rate of 35.0% due to state and local taxes, non-deductible expenses and an increase in the valuation allowance related to the impairment loss recognized on investment securities. Net Income. Net income increased $49.0 million, or approximately 49%, to $149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in income from operations, a decrease in interest expense and a decrease in the impairment loss on investment securities. These items were partially offset by lower interest and other income for the year ended December 31, 2008. Performance Measures In managing our business and assessing our financial performance, we supplement the information provided by financial statement measures with several customer-focused performance metrics that are widely used in the wireless industry. These metrics include average revenue per user per month, or ARPU, which measures service revenue per customer; cost per gross customer addition, or CPGA, which measures the average cost of acquiring a new customer; cost per user per month, or CPU, which measures the non-selling cash cost of operating our business on a per customer basis; and churn, which measures turnover in our customer base. For a reconciliation of Non-GAAP performance measures and a further discussion of the measures, please read “— Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. The following table shows annual metric information for 2007, 2008 and 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Customers: End of period 6,639,524 5,366,833 3,962,786 Net additions 1,272,691 1,404,047 1,021,800 Churn: Average monthly rate 5.5 % 4.7 % 4.7 % ARPU $ 40.68 $ 41.39 $ 43.31 CPGA $ 145.79 $ 127.21 $ 127.97 CPU $ 17.23 $ 18.17 $ 18.33 Customers. Net customer additions were 1,272,691 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 1,404,047 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in net customer additions is primarily attributable to current economic conditions and increased competition. Total customers were 6,639,524 as of December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately 24% over the customer total as of December 31, 2008. The increase in total customers is primarily attributable to the continued demand for our service offerings and the launch of our services in the New York and Boston metropolitan areas in early 2009. Net customer additions were 1,404,047 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 1,021,800 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Total customers were 5,366,833 as of December 31, 2008, an increase of 35% over the customer total as of December 31, 2007. The increase in total customers in 2008 was largely attributable to the continued demand for our service offerings, and the launch of our services in new markets. Churn. As we do not require a long-term service contract, our churn percentage is expected to be higher than traditional wireless carriers that require customers to sign a one- to two-year contract with significant early termination fees. Average monthly churn represents (a) the number of customers who have been disconnected from our system during the measurement period less the number of customers who have reactivated service, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. We classify delinquent customers as churn after they have been delinquent for 30 days. In addition, when an existing customer establishes a new account in connection with the purchase of an upgraded or replacement phone and does not identify themselves as an existing customer, we count the phone leaving service as a churn and the new phone entering service as a gross customer addition. Churn for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 5.5%, compared to 4.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in churn was primarily related to incremental gross additions of approximately 1.3 million customers during the nine months ended September 30, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008, coupled with churn from increased competition. Our customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. Based on historical results, we generally expect net customer additions to be strongest in the first and fourth quarters. Softening of sales 78 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and increased churn in the second and third quarters of the year usually combine to result in fewer net customer additions during these quarters. See – “Seasonality.” Average Revenue Per User. ARPU represents (a) service revenues plus impact to service revenues of promotional activity less pass through charges for the measurement period, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. ARPU was $40.68 and $41.39 for year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The $0.71 decrease in ARPU was primarily attributable to higher participation in our Family Plans and promotional service plans offered during 2009, as well as reduced revenue from certain features included in our service plans that were previously provided a la carte. These decreases were partially offset by our unlimited international calling plan that launched in June 2009. ARPU was $43.31 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $1.92 decrease in ARPU for the year ended December 31, 2008, was primarily attributable to higher participation in our Family Plans as well as reduced revenue from certain features included in our service plans that were previously provided a la carte. Cost Per Gross Addition. CPGA is determined by dividing (a) selling expenses plus the total cost of equipment associated with transactions with new customers less equipment revenues associated with transactions with new customers during the measurement period adjusted for impact to service revenues of promotional activity by (b) gross customer additions during such period. Retail customer service expenses and equipment margin on handsets sold to existing customers when they are identified, including handset upgrade transactions, are excluded, as these costs are incurred specifically for existing customers. CPGA costs increased to $145.79 for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $127.21 for the year ended December 31, 2008. This was primarily driven by the Northeast Markets related to the launches of service in New York and Boston metropolitan areas in early 2009, coupled with increased promotional activities in all markets. CPGA has decreased to $127.21 for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $127.97 for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was primarily driven by a 33% increase in gross additions, partially offset by an increase in selling expenses associated with the continued customer growth in our Core Markets and the launch of service in new markets. Cost Per User. CPU is determined by dividing (a) cost of service and general and administrative costs (excluding applicable non-cash stock-based compensation expense included in cost of service and general and administrative expense) plus net loss on handset equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. CPU for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $17.23 and $18.17, respectively. CPU for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $18.33. We continue to achieve cost benefits due to the increasing scale of our business. However, these benefits have been partially offset by the costs associated with our unlimited international calling plan as well as the launch expenses and ramp up of operations in the Northeast Markets, which contributed $2.11 and $1.77 of additional CPU for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The following table shows consolidated quarterly metric information for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009. Three Months Ended March 31,2008 June 30,2008 September 30,2008 December 31,2008 March 31,2009 June 30,2009 September 30,2009 December 31,2009 Customers: End of period 4,414,519 4,598,049 4,847,314 5,366,833 6,050,527 6,256,112 6,322,269 6,639,524 Net additions 451,733 183,530 249,265 519,519 683,694 205,585 66,157 317,255 Churn: Average monthly rate 4.0 % 4.5 % 4.8 % 5.1 % 5.0 % 5.8 % 5.8 % 5.3 % ARPU $ 42.51 $ 42.05 $ 40.73 $ 40.52 $ 40.40 $ 40.52 $ 41.08 $ 40.70 CPGA $ 125.00 $ 140.82 $ 128.21 $ 119.82 $ 134.23 $ 159.87 $ 153.94 $ 138.36 CPU $ 18.86 $ 18.23 $ 18.18 $ 17.55 $ 16.69 $ 16.82 $ 17.27 $ 18.06 79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Core Markets Performance Measures Set forth below is a summary of certain key performance measures for the periods indicated for our Core Markets: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Core Markets Customers: End of period 5,860,613 5,262,682 3,962,786 Net additions 597,931 1,299,896 1,021,800 Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,161,485 $ 901,751 $ 694,761 Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA as a Percent of Service Revenues 40.1 % 37.2 % 36.2 % As of December 31, 2009, our networks in our Core Markets cover a population of approximately 65 million. Customers. Net customer additions in our Core Markets were 597,931 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 1,299,896 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in net customer additions is primarily attributable to the maturation of our Core Markets, current economic conditions and increased competition. Total customers were 5,860,613 as of December 31, 2009, an increase of 11% over the customer total as of December 31, 2008. Net customer additions in our Core Markets were 1,299,896 for the year ended December 31, 2008, bringing our total customers to 5,262,682 as of December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately 33% over the total customers as of December 31, 2007. The increase in total customers is primarily attributable to the continued demand for our service offerings. Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is presented in accordance with ASC 280 as it is the primary performance metric for which our reportable segments are evaluated and it is utilized by management to facilitate evaluation of our ability to meet future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to fund future growth. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.2 billion compared to approximately $901.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $694.8 million. We continue to experience increases in Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA as a result of continued customer growth and cost benefits due to the increasing scale of our business in the Core Markets. Segment Adjusted EBITDA as a Percent of Service Revenues. Segment Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of service revenues is calculated by dividing Segment Adjusted EBITDA by total service revenues. Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was 40.1%, 37.2% and 36.2%, respectively. Consistent with the increase in Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA, we continue to experience corresponding increases in Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of service revenues due to the growth in service revenues as well as cost benefits due to the increasing scale of our business in the Core Markets. The following table shows a summary of certain quarterly key performance measures for the periods indicated for our Core Markets. Three Months Ended March 31,2008 June 30,2008 September 30,2008 December 31,2008 March 31,2009 June 30,2009 September 30,2009 December 31,2009 (Dollars in thousands) Core Markets Customers: End of period 4,414,519 4,598,049 4,802,692 5,262,682 5,697,581 5,710,226 5,655,785 5,860,613 Net additions 451,733 183,530 204,643 459,990 434,899 12,645 (54,441 ) 204,828 Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA $ 192,542 $ 232,011 $ 236,328 $ 240,870 $ 268,418 $ 293,999 $ 315,810 $ 283,258 Core Markets Adjusted EBITDA as a Percent of Service Revenues 34.3 % 38.8 % 38.9 % 36.7 % 38.2 % 40.9 % 42.7 % 38.6 % 80 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Northeast Markets Performance Measures Set forth below is a summary of certain key performance measures for the periods indicated for our Northeast Markets: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Northeast Markets Customers: End of period 778,911 104,151 — Net additions 674,760 104,151 — Northeast Markets Adjusted EBITDA (Deficit) $ (205,241 ) $ (118,618 ) $ (27,766 ) As of December 31, 2009, our networks in our Northeast Markets cover a population of approximately 28 million. Customers. Net customer additions in our Northeast Markets were 674,760 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 104,151 for the year ended December 31, 2008. Total customers were 778,911 as of December 31, 2009 primarily due to the continued demand for our service offerings in the Philadelphia metropolitan area and the launch of service in the New York and Boston metropolitan areas in early 2009. Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Deficit). Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Deficit) is presented in accordance with ASC 280 as it is the primary performance metric for which our reportable segments are evaluated and it is utilized by management to facilitate evaluation of our ability to meet future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to fund future growth. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Northeast Markets Adjusted EBITDA deficit was $205.2 million compared to an Adjusted EBITDA deficit of $118.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in Northeast Markets Adjusted EBITDA deficit was attributable to the significant increase in expenses related to launch expenses and the ramp up of operations in the Northeast Markets. The following table shows a summary of certain quarterly key performance measures for the periods indicated for our Northeast Markets. Three Months Ended March 31,2008 June 30,2008 September 30,2008 December 31,2008 March 31,2009 June 30,2009 September 30,2009 December 31,2009 (Dollars in thousands) Northeast Markets Customers: End of period — — 44,622 104,151 352,946 545,886 666,484 778,911 Net additions — — 44,622 59,529 248,795 192,940 120,598 112,427 Northeast Markets Adjusted EBITDA (Deficit) $ (14,728 ) $ (21,844 ) $ (35,440 ) $ (46,606 ) $ (69,424 ) $ (60,168 ) $ (43,631 ) $ (32,018 ) Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance. A Non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows; or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented. ARPU, CPGA, and CPU are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to judge our ability to meet our liquidity requirements and to evaluate our operating performance. We believe these measures are important in understanding the performance of our operations from period to period, and although every company in the wireless industry does not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures (which are common in the wireless industry) facilitate key liquidity and operating performance comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry. The following tables reconcile our Non-GAAP financial measures with our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. ARPU — We utilize ARPU to evaluate our per-customer service revenue realization and to assist in forecasting our future service revenues. ARPU is calculated exclusive of pass through charges that we collect from our customers and remit to the appropriate government agencies. 81 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Average number of customers for any measurement period is determined by dividing (a) the sum of the average monthly number of customers for the measurement period by (b) the number of months in such period. Average monthly number of customers for any month represents the sum of the number of customers on the first day of the month and the last day of the month divided by two. ARPU for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes approximately $42.9 million that would have been recognized as service revenues but were classified as equipment revenues because the consideration received from customers was less than the fair value of promotionally priced handsets. The following table shows the calculation of ARPU for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands, except average number ofcustomers and ARPU) Calculation of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Service revenues $ 3,130,385 $ 2,437,250 $ 1,919,197 Add: Impact to service revenues of promotional activity 42,931 — — Less: Pass through charges (173,099 ) (136,801 ) (95,946 ) Net service revenues $ 3,000,217 $ 2,300,449 $ 1,823,251 Divided by: Average number of customers 6,145,414 4,631,168 3,508,497 ARPU $ 40.68 $ 41.39 $ 43.31 Three Months Ended March 31,2008 June 30,2008 September 30,2008 December 31,2008 (In thousands, except average number of customers and ARPU) Calculation of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Service revenues $ 561,970 $ 598,562 $ 610,691 $ 666,028 Less: Pass through charges (26,554 ) (30,583 ) (31,445 ) (48,220 ) Net service revenues $ 535,416 $ 567,979 $ 579,246 $ 617,808 Divided by: Average number of customers 4,198,794 4,501,980 4,741,043 5,082,856 ARPU $ 42.51 $ 42.05 $ 40.73 $ 40.52 Three Months Ended March 31,2009 June 30,2009 September 30,2009 December 31,2009 (In thousands, except average number of customers and ARPU) Calculation of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Service revenues $ 726,698 $ 766,850 $ 812,340 $ 824,498 Add: Impact to service revenues of promotional activity — 24,728 12,481 5,721 Less: Pass through charges (37,643 ) (39,641 ) (48,030 ) (47,785 ) Net service revenues $ 689,055 $ 751,937 $ 776,791 $ 782,434 Divided by: Average number of customers 5,685,830 6,185,166 6,303,075 6,407,637 ARPU $ 40.40 $ 40.52 $ 41.08 $ 40.70 CPGA — We utilize CPGA to assess the efficiency of our distribution strategy, validate the initial capital invested in our customers and determine the number of months to recover our customer acquisition costs. This measure also allows us to compare our average acquisition costs per new customer to those of other wireless broadband mobile providers. Equipment revenues related to new customers, adjusted for the impact to service revenues of promotional activity, are deducted from selling expenses in this calculation as they represent amounts paid by customers at the time their service is activated that reduce our acquisition cost of those customers. Additionally, equipment costs associated with existing customers, net of related revenues, are excluded as this measure is intended to reflect only the acquisition costs related to new customers. The following table reconciles total costs used in the calculation of CPGA to selling expenses, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to CPGA. 82 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands, except gross customer additions and CPGA) Calculation of Cost Per Gross Addition (CPGA): Selling expenses $ 302,275 $ 212,293 $ 153,065 Less: Equipment revenues (350,130 ) (314,266 ) (316,537 ) Add: Impact to service revenues of promotional activity 42,931 — — Add: Equipment revenue not associated with new customers 169,929 149,029 142,822 Add: Cost of equipment 884,272 704,648 597,233 Less: Equipment costs not associated with new customers (275,793 ) (244,311 ) (192,153 ) Gross addition expenses $ 773,484 $ 507,393 $ 384,430 Divided by: Gross customer additions 5,305,505 3,988,692 3,004,177 CPGA $ 145.79 $ 127.21 $ 127.97 Three Months Ended March 31,2008 June 30,2008 September 30,2008 December 31,2008 (In thousands, except gross customer additions and CPGA) Calculation of Cost Per Gross Addition (CPGA): Selling expenses $ 46,647 $ 53,180 $ 58,916 $ 53,551 Less: Equipment revenues (100,384 ) (80,245 ) (76,030 ) (57,606 ) Add: Equipment revenue not associated with new customers 45,803 37,613 33,295 32,318 Add: Cost of equipment 200,158 160,088 160,538 183,864 Less: Equipment costs not associated with new customers (72,212 ) (58,993 ) (56,891 ) (56,215 ) Gross addition expenses $ 120,012 $ 111,643 $ 119,828 $ 155,912 Divided by: Gross customer additions 960,083 792,823 934,607 1,301,179 CPGA $ 125.00 $ 140.82 $ 128.21 $ 119.82 Three Months Ended March 31,2009 June 30,2009 September 30,2009 December 31,2009 (In thousands, except gross customer additions and CPGA) Calculation of Cost Per Gross Addition (CPGA): Selling expenses $ 74,906 $ 74,272 $ 72,968 $ 80,129 Less: Equipment revenues (68,631 ) (92,762 ) (83,253 ) (105,484 ) Add: Impact to service revenues of promotional activity — 24,728 12,481 5,721 Add: Equipment revenue not associated with new customers 41,215 41,829 38,742 48,143 Add: Cost of equipment 225,018 227,400 199,092 232,762 Less: Equipment costs not associated with new customers (67,058 ) (69,424 ) (62,041 ) (77,270 ) Gross addition expenses $ 205,450 $ 206,043 $ 177,989 $ 184,001 Divided by: Gross customer additions 1,530,565 1,288,818 1,156,242 1,329,880 CPGA $ 134.23 $ 159.87 $ 153.94 $ 138.36 CPU — We utilize CPU as a tool to evaluate the non-selling cash expenses associated with ongoing business operations on a per customer basis, to track changes in these non-selling cash costs over time, and to help evaluate how changes in our business operations affect non-selling cash costs per customer. In addition, CPU provides management with a useful measure to compare our non-selling cash costs per customer with those of other wireless providers. We believe investors use CPU primarily as a tool to track changes in our non-selling cash costs over time and to compare our non-selling cash costs to those of other wireless providers, although other wireless carriers may calculate this measure differently. The following table reconciles total costs used in the calculation of CPU to cost of service, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to CPU. 83 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands, except average number of customers and CPU) Calculation of Cost Per User (CPU): Cost of service $ 1,120,052 $ 857,295 $ 647,510 Add: General and administrative expenses 265,455 235,289 198,955 Add: Net loss on equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition 105,864 95,282 49,331 Less: Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of service and general and administrative expense (47,783 ) (41,142 ) (28,024 ) Less: Pass through charges (173,099 ) (136,801 ) (95,946 ) Total costs used in the calculation of CPU $ 1,270,489 $ 1,009,923 $ 771,826 Divided by: Average number of customers 6,145,414 4,631,168 3,508,497 CPU $ 17.23 $ 18.17 $ 18.33 Three Months Ended March 31,2008 June 30,2008 September 30,2008 December 31,2008 (In thousands, except average number of customers and CPU) Calculation of Cost Per User (CPU): Cost of service $ 188,473 $ 206,140 $ 219,423 $ 243,259 Add: General and administrative expenses 57,727 60,239 57,738 59,584 Add: Net loss on equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition 26,409 21,380 23,596 23,897 Less: Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of service and general and administrative expense (8,465 ) (11,007 ) (10,782 ) (10,888 ) Less: Pass through charges (26,554 ) (30,583 ) (31,445 ) (48,220 ) Total costs used in the calculation of CPU $ 237,590 $ 246,169 $ 258,530 $ 267,632 Divided by: Average number of customers 4,198,794 4,501,980 4,741,043 5,082,856 CPU $ 18.86 $ 18.23 $ 18.18 $ 17.55 Three Months Ended March 31,2009 June 30,2009 September 30,2009 December 31,2009 (In thousands, except average number of customers and CPU) Calculation of Cost Per User (CPU): Cost of service $ 245,575 $ 268,733 $ 298,288 $ 307,456 Add: General and administrative expenses 61,505 68,049 65,492 70,410 Add: Net loss on equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition 25,843 27,595 23,299 29,127 Less: Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of service and general and administrative expense (10,669 ) (12,673 ) (12,426 ) (12,016 ) Less: Pass through charges (37,643 ) (39,641 ) (48,030 ) (47,785 ) Total costs used in the calculation of CPU $ 284,611 $ 312,063 $ 326,623 $ 347,192 Divided by: Average number of customers 5,685,830 6,185,116 6,303,075 6,407,637 CPU $ 16.69 $ 16.82 $ 17.27 $ 18.06 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and cash generated from operations. At December 31, 2009, we had a total of approximately $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Over the last three years, the capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile as a result of adverse economic and financial conditions that have triggered the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies and a global recession. We believe that this increased volatility and global recession may make it difficult at times to obtain additional financing, sell additional equity or debt securities, or to refinance existing indebtedness. We believe that, based on our current level of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and our anticipated cash flows from operations, the current adverse economic and financial conditions in the credit and capital markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity, cash flow, financial flexibility or our ability to fund our operations in the near-term. On January 20, 2009, Wireless completed the sale of the New 9 1/4% Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the sale of the New 9 1/4% Senior Notes were approximately $480.3 million. The net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes which could include working capital, capital expenditures, future liquidity needs, additional opportunistic spectrum acquisitions, corporate development opportunities and future technology initiatives. Our strategy has been to offer our services in major metropolitan areas and their surrounding areas, which we refer to as operating segments. We are seeking opportunities to enhance our current operating segments and to provide service in new geographic areas. From time to time, we may purchase spectrum and related assets from 84 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements third parties or the FCC. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fully fund planned expansion. The construction of our network and the marketing and distribution of our wireless communications products and services have required, and will continue to require, substantial capital investment. Capital outlays have included license acquisition costs, capital expenditures for construction of our network infrastructure, costs associated with clearing and relocating non-governmental incumbent licenses, funding of operating cash flow losses incurred as we launch services in new metropolitan areas and other working capital costs, debt service and financing fees and expenses. Our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $831.7 million, $954.6 million and $767.7 million, respectively. These expenditures were primarily associated with the construction of the network infrastructure in our Northeast Markets and our efforts to increase the service area and capacity of our existing Core Markets network through the addition of cell sites, DAS, and switches. We believe the increased service area and capacity in existing markets will improve our service offerings, helping us to attract additional customers and retain existing customers and increase revenues. In September 2009, Wireless entered into a Master Procurement Agreement , or MPA, with a network infrastructure and equipment provider under which the provider will sell and license to Wireless on a non-exclusive basis long-term evolution, or LTE, system products and services, or collectively the LTE Products and Services. The initial term of the MPA, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the MPA, continues to the earlier to occur of four years or the date which Wireless has purchased a minimum number of certain products under the MPA. Upon the conclusion of the initial term, at Wireless’ sole option, the MPA may be renewed on an annual basis for up to five one-year renewal terms. The MPA includes discounts and incentives for Wireless’ purchase and licensing of LTE Products and Services, and provides that, except in certain circumstances, Wireless will make certain prepayments for LTE Products and Services during the first fourteen months of the initial term. Except as may be otherwise permitted at certain times under the MPA, if Wireless (i) terminates the MPA before the end of the initial term without cause or Wireless does not renew the MPA after the initial term and (ii) has not purchased a minimum number of certain products, Wireless will be obligated to pay for certain products previously delivered and accepted and may also have to pay certain liquidated damages. As of December 31, 2009, we owed an aggregate of approximately $3.5 billion under our senior secured credit facility and 9 1/4% senior notes as well as approximately $181.2 million under our capital lease obligations. Our senior secured credit facility calculates consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as: consolidated net income plus depreciation and amortization; gain (loss) on disposal of assets; non-cash expenses; gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt; provision for income taxes; interest expense; and certain expenses of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. minus interest and other income and non-cash items increasing consolidated net income. We consider consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, to be an important indicator to investors because it provides information related to our ability to provide cash flows to meet future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and fund future growth. We present consolidated Adjusted EBITDA because covenants in our senior secured credit facility contain ratios based on this measure. Other wireless carriers may calculate consolidated Adjusted EBITDA differently. If our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA were to decline below certain levels, covenants in our senior secured credit facility that are based on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, including our maximum senior secured leverage ratio covenant, may be violated and could cause, among other things, an inability to incur further indebtedness and in certain circumstances a default or mandatory prepayment under our senior secured credit facility. Our maximum senior secured leverage ratio is required to be less than 4.5 to 1.0 based on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA plus the impact of certain new markets. The lenders under our senior secured credit facility use the senior secured leverage ratio to measure our ability to meet our obligations on our senior secured debt by comparing the total amount of such debt to our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which our lenders use to estimate our cash flow from operations. The senior secured leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of senior secured indebtedness to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by our senior secured credit facility. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, our senior secured leverage ratio was 1.67 to 1.0, which means for every $1.00 of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, we had $1.67 of senior secured indebtedness. In addition, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is also utilized, among other measures, to determine management’s compensation levels. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income, or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to, or more meaningful than cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. 85 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table shows the calculation of our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our senior secured credit facility, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009.

In addition, for further information, the following table reconciles consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our senior secured credit facility, to cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In Thousands) Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 899,349 $ 447,490 $ 589,306 Adjustments: Interest expense 270,285 179,398 201,746 Non-cash interest expense (11,309 ) (2,550 ) (3,259 ) Interest and other income (2,629 ) (23,170 ) (63,936 ) Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable (199 ) (8 ) (129 ) Deferred rent expense (24,222 ) (20,646 ) (13,745 ) Cost of abandoned cell sites (8,286 ) (8,592 ) (6,704 ) Accretion of asset retirement obligation (5,111 ) (3,542 ) (1,439 ) Gain on sale and maturity of investments 644 — 10,506 Provision for income taxes 86,835 129,986 123,098 Deferred income taxes (110,161 ) (124,347 ) (118,524 ) Changes in working capital (138,952 ) 209,114 (49,925 ) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $ 956,244 $ 783,133 $ 666,995 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased approximately $451.9 million to approximately $899.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 from $447.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash flows from working capital changes and an increase in net income during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $141.8 million to $447.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 from $589.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in working capital during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007, partially offset by an approximately 49% increase in net income as a result of the growth experienced over the last twelve months. Cash provided by operating activities increased $224.5 million to $589.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 from $364.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an 87% increase in net income as well as a 266% increase in deferred income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. 86 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to approximately $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was due primarily to a $313.0 million decrease in purchases of FCC licenses as well as a $122.9 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by an approximate $224.2 million increase in net purchases of short-term investments. Cash used in investing activities was $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $517.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was due primarily to $328.5 million in purchases of FCC licenses, $25.2 million in cash used for business acquisitions, a $186.9 million increase in purchases of property and equipment which was primarily related to construction in the Northeast Markets, and $267.2 million in net proceeds from the sale of investments during the year ended December 31, 2007 that did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2008. Cash used in investing activities was $517.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $1.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was mainly due to $1.4 billion in purchases of FCC licenses during the year ended December 31, 2006 that did not recur in 2007 as well as a $264.7 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of investments, partially offset by a $217.0 million increase in purchases of property and equipment. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $449.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $74.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was due primarily to $480.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the New 9 1/4% Senior Notes in January 2009, partially offset by an approximate $99.7 million decrease in book overdraft. Cash provided by financing activities was $74.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $1.2 billion for year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was due primarily to $818.3 million in net proceeds from the Company’s initial public offering that was completed in April 2007 and $420.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the additional notes in June 2007 that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in proceeds from various financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2007 included $818.3 million in net proceeds from the company’s initial public offering that was completed in April 2007 and $421.0 million in net proceeds from the sale of additional notes in June 2007. Senior Secured Credit Facility Wireless, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MetroPCS Communications, Inc., entered into the Senior Secured Credit Facility on November 3, 2006, or senior secured credit facility. The senior secured credit facility consists of a $1.6 billion term loan facility and a $100 million revolving credit facility. The term loan facility is repayable in quarterly installments in annual aggregate amounts equal to 1% of the initial aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion. The term loan facility will mature in November 2013. The revolving credit facility will mature in November 2011. The facilities under the senior secured credit agreement are guaranteed by MetroPCS Communications, Inc., MetroPCS, Inc. and each of Wireless’ direct and indirect present and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. The facilities are not guaranteed by Royal Street, but Wireless has pledged the promissory note given by Royal Street in connection with amounts borrowed by Royal Street from Wireless and we pledged the limited liability company member interests we hold in Royal Street Communications. The senior secured credit facility contains customary events of default, including cross defaults. The obligations are also secured by the capital stock of Wireless as well as substantially all of the present and future assets of Wireless and each of its direct and indirect present and future wholly-owned subsidiaries (except as prohibited by law and certain permitted exceptions). 87 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Under the senior secured credit agreement, Wireless will be subject to certain limitations, including limitations on its ability to incur additional debt, make certain restricted payments, sell assets, make certain investments or acquisitions, grant liens and pay dividends. Wireless is also subject to certain financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum senior secured consolidated leverage ratio and, under certain circumstances, maximum consolidated leverage and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios. There is no prohibition on our ability to make investments in or loan money to Royal Street. Amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facility bear interest at a LIBOR rate plus a margin as set forth in the facility and the terms of the senior secured credit facility require us to enter into interest rate hedging agreements that fix the interest rate in an amount equal to at least 50% of our outstanding indebtedness, including the 9 1/4% senior notes. On November 21, 2006, Wireless entered into a three-year interest rate protection agreement to manage its interest rate risk exposure and fulfill a requirement of its senior secured credit facility. The agreement covers a notional amount of $1.0 billion and effectively converts this portion of Wireless’ variable rate debt to fixed-rate debt at an annual rate of 7.169%. The quarterly interest settlement periods began on February 1, 2007. The interest rate protection agreement expired on February 1, 2010. On April 30, 2008, Wireless entered into an additional two-year interest rate protection agreement to manage its interest rate risk exposure. The agreement was effective on June 30, 2008 and covers a notional amount of $500.0 million and effectively converts this portion of Wireless’ variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at an annual rate of 5.464%. The monthly interest settlement periods began on June 30, 2008. The interest rate protection agreement expires on June 30, 2010. In March 2009, Wireless entered into three separate two-year interest rate protection agreements to manage the Company’s interest rate risk exposure. These agreements are effective on February 1, 2010 and cover a notional amount of $1.0 billion and effectively convert this portion of Wireless’ variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at a weighted average annual rate of 4.381%. The monthly interest settlement periods will begin on February 1, 2010. These agreements expire on February 1, 2012. 9 1/4% Senior Notes Due 2014 On November 3, 2006, Wireless consummated the sale of $1.0 billion principal amount of its 9 1/4% senior notes due 2014, or initial notes. On June 6, 2007, Wireless consummated the sale of the additional notes. The initial notes and the additional notes are referred to together as the existing 9 1/4% senior notes. The existing 9 1/4% senior notes are unsecured obligations and are guaranteed by MetroPCS Communications, Inc., MetroPCS, Inc., and all of Wireless direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, but are not guaranteed by Royal Street. Interest is payable on the initial notes on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning with May 1, 2007, with respect to the initial notes, and beginning on November 1, 2007 with respect to the additional notes. On January 14, 2009, Wireless completed the sale of the New 9 1/4% Senior Notes at a price equal to 89.50% of the principal amount of such new notes. On January 20, 2009, Wireless consummated the sale of the New 9 1/4% Senior Notes resulting in net proceeds of $480.3 million. The New 9 1/4% Senior Notes are unsecured obligations and are guaranteed by MetroPCS, MetroPCS, Inc., and all of Wireless’ direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, but are not guaranteed by Royal Street. Interest is payable on the New 9 1/4% Senior Notes on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2009. The existing 9 1/4% senior notes together with the New 9 1/4% Senior Notes are referred to herein as the 9 1/4% senior notes. Wireless may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 9 1/4% senior notes at any time on or after November 1, 2010 for the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 9 1/4 % senior notes. In addition, Wireless may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 9 1/4% senior notes with the net cash proceeds of certain sales of equity securities, including the sale of common stock. Capital Lease Obligations We have entered into various non-cancelable capital lease agreements, with expirations through 2025. Assets and future obligations related to capital leases are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in property and equipment and long-term debt, respectively. Depreciation of assets held under capital lease obligations is included in depreciation and amortization expense. 88 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Capital Expenditures and Other Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions Capital Expenditures. We currently expect to incur capital expenditures in the range of $600.0 million to $800.0 million on a consolidated basis for the year ending December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred approximately $831.7 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion and improvement of our existing network infrastructure and costs associated with the construction of new markets. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred $954.6 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion and improvement of our existing network infrastructure and costs associated with the construction of new markets. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred $767.7 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion and improvement of our existing network infrastructure and costs associated with the construction of new markets. Other Acquisitions and Dispositions. We participated as a bidder in FCC Auction 73, and on June 26, 2008, we were granted one 12 MHz 700 MHz license for a total aggregate purchase price of approximately $313.3 million. This 700 MHz license supplements the 10 MHz of AWS spectrum previously granted to us in the Boston-Worcester, Massachusetts/New Hampshire/Rhode Island/Vermont Economic Area as a result of FCC Auction 66. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we closed on various agreements for the acquisition and exchange of spectrum in the net aggregate amount of approximately $14.6 million and $21.8 million in cash, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received $52.3 million in fair value of FCC licenses in exchanges with other parties. On February 2, 2010, we entered into a like-kind spectrum exchange agreement covering licenses in certain markets with another service provider, or Service Provider. The Service Provider will acquire 10 MHz of AWS spectrum in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas; Shreveport-Bossier City, Louisiana; and an additional 10 MHz of AWS spectrum in certain other Washington markets, as well as an additional 10 MHz of PCS spectrum in Sacramento, California. We will acquire an additional 10 MHz of AWS spectrum in Santa Barbara, California; Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida; and 10MHz of AWS spectrum in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas and Shreveport-Bossier City, Louisiana. Consummation of this spectrum exchange agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including FCC consent. In addition, we have entered into short-term lease agreements with the Service Provider that, subject to FCC approval, authorize the Service Provider and us to use the spectrum covered by the spectrum exchange agreement until the spectrum exchange is consummated. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 89 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table provides aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009. Also, see Note 11 to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Payments Due by Period Total LessThan1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years MoreThan5 Years (In thousands) Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt, including current portion $ 3,498,000 $ 16,000 $ 32,000 $ 3,450,000 $ — Interest expense on long-term debt(1) 1,250,283 280,593 558,078 411,612 — Purchase obligations (2) 275,247 183,705 71,889 19,653 — Other long-term liabilities (3) 26,898 24,157 2,741 — — Handset purchase commitment 17,200 17,200 — — — Contractual tax obligations (4) 2,773 2,773 — — — Capital lease obligations 338,128 20,363 41,137 43,643 232,985 Operating leases 2,232,900 271,374 537,092 531,296 893,138 Total cash contractual obligations $ 7,641,429 $ 816,165 $ 1,242,937 $ 4,456,204 $ 1,126,123 (1) Interest expense on long-term debt includes future interest payments on outstanding obligations under our senior secured credit facility and 9 1/4% senior notes. The senior secured credit facility bears interest at a floating rate tied to a fixed spread to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate. The interest expense presented in this table is based on the rates at December 31, 2009 which was 6.474% and includes the impact of our interest rate protection agreements, for the senior secured credit facility. (2) Includes expected commitments for future capital lease obligations and purchases of network equipment. (3) Represents payment obligations under our interest rate protection agreements. (4) Represents the liability reported in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740 (Topic 740, “Income Taxes”). Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, other than the items included in the table above, the Company was unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these remaining liabilities might be paid. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $3.3 million as of December 31, 2009, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 15, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Inflation We believe that inflation has not materially affected our operations. Effect of New Accounting Standards In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133,” (“SFAS No. 161”) amending ASC 815 (Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging”). SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures about a company’s derivative and hedging activities. These enhanced disclosures discuss (a) how and why a company uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedge items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 became effective for fiscal years beginning on or after November 15, 2008. The implementation of this standard did result in enhanced disclosures, but did not affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168, “The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles – A Replacement of FASB No. 162,” (“SFAS No. 168”) amending (ASC 105 (Topic 105, “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”)). SFAS 168 replaces SFAS No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,” and establishes the FASB Accounting Standards CodificationTM, as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. SFAS No. 168 was effective for interim or annual financial reporting periods ending after September 15, 2009. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, but did change the way authoritative accounting pronouncements are referenced in our consolidated financial statements. 90 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2009-05 (“ASU 2009-05”), “Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value,” which updates ASC 820 (Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”). ASU 2009-05 addresses the impact of transfer restrictions on the fair value of a liability that is traded as an asset as an input to the valuation of the underlying liability, and clarifies when to make adjustments to fair value. ASU 2009-05 is effective for periods ending after August 26, 2009. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2009-13, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements—a consensus of the EITF,” (“ASU 2009-13”) which amends ASC 605 (Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition”). This amended guidance addresses the determination of when individual deliverables within an arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable deliverables. ASU 2009-13 is effective prospectively for the Company on January 1, 2011, although early adoption is permitted provided that it is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption. We have not yet determined the effect on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption of ASU 2009-13. In December 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-17, “Amendments to FASB Interpretation 46(R),” (“ASU 2009-17”) revising authoritative guidance associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities. This revised guidance replaces the current quantitative-based assessment for determining which enterprise has a controlling interest in a variable interest entity with an approach that is now primarily qualitative. This qualitative approach focuses on identifying the enterprise that has (i) the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that can most significantly impact the entity’s performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. This revised guidance also requires an ongoing assessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity rather than a reassessment only upon the occurrence of specific events. ASU 2009-17 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2010. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, including interest rates. We do not routinely enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading, speculative or hedging purposes, unless it is hedging interest rate risk exposure or is required by our senior secured credit facility. We do not currently conduct business internationally, so we are generally not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $1.5 billion in outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility that bears interest at floating rates based on the London Inter Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.25%. The interest rate on the outstanding debt under our senior secured credit facility as of December 31, 2009 was 6.474%, which includes the impact of our interest rate protection agreements. On November 21, 2006, to manage our interest rate risk exposure and fulfill a requirement of our senior secured credit facility, we entered into a three-year interest rate protection agreement. This agreement covers a notional amount of $1.0 billion and effectively converts this portion of our variable rate debt to fixed-rate debt at an annual rate of 7.169%. The quarterly interest settlement periods began on February 1, 2007. The interest rate swap agreement expired in February 2010. On April 30, 2008, to manage our interest rate risk exposure, we entered into a two-year interest rate protection agreement. The agreement was effective on June 30, 2008, covers a notional amount of $500.0 million and effectively converts this portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at an annual rate of 5.464%. The monthly interest settlement periods began on June 30, 2008. The interest rate protection agreement expires on June 30, 2010. If market LIBOR rates increase 100 basis points over the rates in effect at December 31, 2009, annual interest expense on the approximate $48.0 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate protection agreements would increase approximately $0.5 million.",2023-12-30 17:44:02.750339
1283699,TMUS,"T-Mobile US, Inc.",2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Company Overview Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are those of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MetroPCS Wireless, Inc., or Wireless. References to “MetroPCS,” “MetroPCS Communications,” “our Company,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer to MetroPCS Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. We are a wireless telecommunications carrier that currently offers wireless broadband mobile services primarily in selected major metropolitan areas in the United States, including the Atlanta, Boston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Orlando/Jacksonville, Philadelphia, Sacramento, San Francisco and Tampa/Sarasota metropolitan areas. In September 2010, we introduced the first commercial 4G LTE service in our Las Vegas and Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan areas. Subsequently in 2010, we launched our 4G LTE service in our Detroit, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, New York, San Francisco and Sacramento metropolitan areas. We further expanded our 4G LTE services into Atlanta, Jacksonville, Miami and Orlando metropolitan areas in January of 2011. In 2005, Royal Street Communications, LLC, or Royal Street Communications, and with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, or collectively, Royal Street, was granted licenses by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, in Los Angeles and various metropolitan areas throughout northern Florida. From 2005 through 2010, Royal Street constructed networks with our assistance in its licensed service areas and, pursuant to agreements with us that were reviewed and approved by the FCC, sold us services on its network on a wholesale basis which we in turn marketed on a retail basis under the MetroPCS® brand to our customers. In December 2010, we consummated the purchase of the remaining 15% interest in Royal Street Communications with the consent of the FCC, resulting in Royal Street Communications and its wholly-owned subsidiaries becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. As a result of the significant growth we have experienced since we launched operations, our results of operations to date are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected in future periods. Moreover, we expect that our number of customers will continue to increase, which will continue to contribute to increases in our revenues and operating expenses. We sell products and services to customers through our Company-owned retail stores as well as indirectly through relationships with independent retailers. Our service allows our customers to place unlimited local calls from within our local service area and to receive unlimited calls from any area while in our service area, for a flat-rate monthly service fee. In January 2010, we introduced a new family of service plans, which include all applicable taxes and regulatory fees and offering nationwide voice, text and web services on an unlimited basis beginning at $40 per month. For an additional $5 to $20 per month, our customers may select alternative service plans that offer additional features on an unlimited basis. On November 4, 2010, we introduced Metro USASM which allows our customers to receive services in an area covering over 280 million population for the same rates as we previously charged to use our voice, text messaging and web browsing services through a combination of our own networks and roaming arrangements with third parties. In January 2011, we introduced new 4G LTE service plans, which include all applicable taxes and regulatory fees, that allow subscribers to enjoy voice, text and web access services at fixed monthly rates starting as low as $40 per month. All of these plans require payment in advance for one month of service. If no payment is made in advance for the following month of service, service is suspended at the end of the month that was paid for by the customer and, if the customer does not pay within 30 days, the customer is terminated. Our service plans differentiate us from the more complex plans and long-term contract requirements of traditional wireless carriers. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. You should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 64 Table of Contents We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Our wireless services are provided on a month-to-month basis and are paid in advance. We recognize revenues from wireless services as they are rendered. Amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Suspending service for non-payment is known as hotlining. We do not recognize revenue on hotlined customers. Revenues and related costs from the sale of accessories are recognized at the point of sale. The cost of handsets sold to indirect retailers are included in deferred charges until they are sold to and activated by customers. Amounts billed to indirect retailers for handsets are recorded as accounts receivable and deferred revenue upon shipment by us and are recognized as equipment revenues and related costs when service is activated by customers. Our customers have the right to return handsets within a specified time or within a certain amount of use, whichever occurs first. We record an estimate for returns as contra-revenue at the time of recognizing revenue. Our assessment of estimated returns is based on historical return rates. If our customers’ actual returns are not consistent with our estimates of their returns, revenues may be different than initially recorded. Our reserves for returns were not significant as of December 31, 2010. We have revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and follow the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 605, (Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition”). ASC 605 addresses the accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting and the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the residual method of accounting. We determined that the sale of wireless services through our direct and indirect sales channels with an accompanying handset constitutes revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. In accordance with ASC 605 we divide these arrangements into separate units of accounting and allocate the consideration between the handset and the wireless service using the residual method of accounting. Consideration received for the wireless service is recognized at fair value as service revenue when earned, and any remaining consideration received is recognized as equipment revenue when the handset is activated by the customer. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our independent retailers to pay for equipment purchases and for amounts estimated to be uncollectible for intercarrier compensation. We estimate allowances for uncollectible accounts from independent retailers based on the length of time the receivables are past due, the current business environment and our historical experience. If the financial condition of a material portion of our independent retailers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific carrier’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record a specific allowance for intercarrier compensation against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. Total allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable as of December 31, 2010 was 4% of the total amount of gross accounts receivable. Inventories We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value or replacement cost based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Write-downs for obsolescent and unmarketable inventory were not significant as of December 31, 2010. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Deferred Income Tax Asset and Other Tax Reserves We assess our deferred tax asset and record a valuation allowance, when necessary, to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future taxable income, taxable temporary differences and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period we made that determination. 65 Table of Contents We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax returns are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and ultimately modified. We adjust the reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of income tax related reserve positions and changes to income tax reserves that we consider appropriate. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is finally resolved. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash or a reduction in our net operating loss carryforwards. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the effective rate in the year of resolution. Tax reserves as of December 31, 2010 were $13.0 million of which approximately $5.8 million and $7.2 million are presented on the consolidated balance sheet in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. Property and Equipment Depreciation on property and equipment is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service, which are seven to ten years for network infrastructure assets, three to ten years for capitalized interest, up to fifteen years for capital lease assets, three to eight years for office equipment, which includes software and computer equipment, three to seven years for furniture and fixtures and five years for vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease and any renewal periods reasonably assured or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. The estimated life of property and equipment is based on historical experience with similar assets, as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. If technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation expense in future periods. Likewise, if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than anticipated, the life of the assets could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to property and equipment. This could result in a reduction of depreciation expense in future periods. We assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or in the strategy for our overall business. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations. There have been no indicators that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable and accordingly no impairment tests have been performed. The carrying value of property and equipment was approximately $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2010. Fair Value Measurements We follow the provisions of ASC 820 (Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”). ASC 820 establishes a three-tiered fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. ASC 820 requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation. FCC Licenses We operate wireless broadband mobile networks under licenses granted by the FCC for a particular geographic area on spectrum allocated by the FCC for terrestrial wireless broadband mobile services. We hold personal communications services, or PCS, licenses granted or acquired on various dates, and in November 2006, we acquired a number of AWS licenses which can be used to provide wireless broadband mobile services comparable to 66 Table of Contents the wireless broadband mobile services provided by us, as well as other advanced wireless services. Our license holdings have grown also to include a 700 MHz license which can be used to provide services comparable to those we can provide over our AWS spectrum. The PCS licenses previously included, and the AWS licenses currently include, the obligation and resulting costs to relocate existing fixed microwave users of our licensed spectrum if the use of our spectrum interfered with their systems and/or reimburse other carriers (according to FCC rules) that relocated prior users if the relocation benefits our system. Accordingly, we incurred costs related to microwave relocation in constructing our PCS and AWS networks. FCC licenses and microwave relocation costs are recorded at cost. Although FCC licenses are issued with a stated term, ten years in the case of PCS licenses, fifteen years in the case of AWS licenses and ten years for 700 MHz licenses, the renewal of PCS, AWS and 700 MHz licenses is generally a routine matter without substantial cost and we have determined that no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors exist as of December 31, 2010 that limit the useful life of our PCS, AWS and 700 MHz licenses. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are our PCS, AWS and 700 MHz licenses and microwave relocation costs. Based on the requirements of ASC 350 (Topic 350, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other”), we test investments in our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. We perform our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test as of each September 30th. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value with the carrying value. An impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related indefinite-lived intangible assets and charged to results of operations. We used an income approach, the Greenfield Methodology, to provide an indication of fair value for our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Such methodology is based on the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up operation and assumes that the only assets upon formation are the underlying FCC licenses, and that the business enterprise does not have any other assets including goodwill or going concern value at the date of inception. The start-up assumptions include utilization of the asset in its highest and best use and incorporate market participant assumptions for key factors, such as current and future technology, costs of telecommunications equipment, and workforce costs, considering the opportunities and constraints of the underlying spectrum as of the valuation date. Cash flow projections and assumptions, although subject to a degree of uncertainty, are based on a combination of our historical performance and trends, our business plans and management’s estimate of future performance, giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive economic conditions. Other assumptions include a weighted average cost of capital and long-term rate of growth for our business. We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that market participants would use to estimate fair value. For the purpose of performing the annual impairment test as of September 30, 2010, our indefinite-lived intangible assets were aggregated and combined into a single unit of accounting. We believe that utilizing our indefinite-lived intangible assets as a group represents the highest and best use of the assets, and the value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets would not be significantly impacted by a sale of one or a portion of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, among other factors. No impairment was recognized as the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was in excess of their carrying value as of September 30, 2010. Historically, we have not experienced significant negative variations between our assumptions and estimates when compared to actual results. However, if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge associated with indefinite-lived intangible assets. Although we do not expect our estimates or assumptions to change significantly in the future, the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets or using a methodology other than a discounted cash flow model could result in different values for our indefinite-lived intangible assets and may affect any related impairment charge. The most significant assumptions within our discounted cash flow model are the discount rate, our projected growth rate and management’s future business plans. A one percent decline in annual revenue growth rates, a one percent decline in annual net cash flows or a one percent increase in discount rate would not result in impairment as of September 30, 2010. Indefinite-lived intangible assets must be tested between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors. We reviewed changes in the business climate, changes in market capitalization, legal factors, operating performance 67 Table of Contents indicators and competition, among other factors and their potential impact on our fair value determination. There have been no significant changes in any of these factors that have adversely affected any of the key assumptions used in our determination of fair value. Furthermore, if any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets are subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, we would test such assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360 (Topic 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment”), and the intangible assets would then be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life. For the license impairment test performed as of September 30, 2010, the aggregate fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets was in excess of the aggregate carrying values. There also have been no subsequent indicators of impairment, including those indicated in ASC 360, and accordingly no subsequent interim impairment tests were performed. Share-Based Payments We account for share-based awards exchanged for employee services in accordance with ASC 718 (Topic 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation”). Under ASC 718, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. We have granted restricted stock awards that entitle the holder to receive shares of common stock which become fully tradable upon vesting. The restricted stock awards granted generally vest on a four-year vesting schedule with 25% vesting on the first anniversary date of the award and the remainder pro-rata on a monthly or quarterly basis thereafter, subject to a service condition that relates only to vesting. The estimated compensation expense, which is equal to the fair value of the awards on the date of grant, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. We have also granted nonqualified stock options. Most of our stock option awards include a service condition that relates only to vesting. The stock option awards generally vest in one to four years from the grant date with 25% vesting on the first anniversary date of the award. Compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award. The determination of the fair value of stock options using an option-pricing model is affected by our common stock valuation as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. The Board of Directors uses the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant as the fair market value for our common stock. The volatility assumption is based on a combination of the historical volatility of our common stock and the volatilities of similar companies over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock options. The volatilities of similar companies are used in conjunction with our historical volatility because of the lack of sufficient relevant history equal to the expected term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. The expected term assumption is estimated based primarily on the stock options’ vesting terms and remaining contractual life and employees’ expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on the grant date appropriate for the term of the employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the expectation of no future dividend payouts by us. The value of the options is determined by using a Black-Scholes pricing model that includes the following variables: 1) exercise price of the instrument, 2) fair market value of the underlying stock on date of grant, 3) expected life, 4) estimated volatility and 5) the risk-free interest rate. We utilized the following weighted-average assumptions in estimating the fair value of the options grants for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: 68 Table of Contents December 31,2010 December 31,2009 Expected dividends 0.00% 0.00% Expected volatility 54.74% 50.01% Risk-free interest rate 2.24% 1.99% Expected lives in years 5.00 5.00 Weighted-average fair value of options: Granted at fair value $ 3.23 $ 6.43 Weighted-average exercise price of options: Granted at fair value $ 6.62 $ 14.23 The Black-Scholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions including expectations of future dividends and stock price volatility. Such assumptions are only used for making the required fair value estimate and should not be considered as indicators of future dividend policy or stock price appreciation. Because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, and because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, the use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model may not provide a reliable estimate of the fair value of employee stock options. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award. As share-based compensation expense under ASC 718 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it is reduced for estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We recognized stock-based compensation expense of $46.5 million, $47.8 million and $41.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Customer Recognition and Disconnect Policies Until January 2010, when a new customer subscribed to our service, the first month of service was included with the handset purchase. Beginning in January 2010, the first month of service is no longer included in the handset purchase. Under GAAP, we are required to allocate the purchase price to the handset and to the wireless service revenue. Generally, the amount allocated to the handset will be less than our cost, and this difference is included in cost per gross addition, or CPGA. We recognize new customers as gross customer additions upon activation of service. Prior to January 2010, we offered our customers the Metro Promise, which allowed a customer to return a newly purchased handset for a full refund prior to the earlier of 30 days or 60 minutes of use. Beginning in January 2010, we revised our Metro Promise policy to allow a customer to return a newly purchased handset for a full refund within 7 days of purchase and less than 60 minutes of use. Customers who returned their phones under the Metro Promise are reflected as a reduction to gross customer additions. Customers’ monthly service payments are due in advance every month. Our customers must pay their monthly service amount by the payment date or their service will be suspended, or hotlined, and the customer will not be able to make or receive calls on our network. However, a hotlined customer is still able to make E-911 calls in the event of an emergency. There is no service grace period. Any call attempted by a hotlined customer is routed directly to our interactive voice response system and customer service center in order to arrange payment. If the customer pays the amount due within 30 days of the original payment date then the customer’s service is restored. If a hotlined customer does not pay the amount due within 30 days of the payment date the account is disconnected and counted as churn. Once an account is disconnected we may charge a reconnect fee upon reactivation to reestablish service and the revenue associated with this fee is deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the customer. Revenues We derive our revenues from the following sources: Service. We sell wireless broadband mobile services. The various types of service revenues associated with wireless broadband mobile for our customers include monthly recurring charges for airtime, one-time or monthly recurring charges for optional features (including nationwide long distance, unlimited international long distance, unlimited text messaging, international text messaging, voicemail, downloads, ringtones, games and content applications, unlimited directory assistance, enhanced directory assistance, ring back tones, mobile Internet 69 Table of Contents browsing, mobile instant messaging, navigation, video streaming, video on demand, push e-mail and nationwide roaming) and charges for long distance service. Service revenues also include intercarrier compensation and nonrecurring reactivation service charges to customers. Equipment. We sell wireless broadband mobile handsets and accessories that are used by our customers in connection with our wireless services. This equipment is also sold to our independent retailers to facilitate distribution to our customers. Costs and Expenses Our costs and expenses include: Cost of Service. The major components of our cost of service are: • Cell Site Costs. We incur expenses for the rent of cell sites, network facilities, engineering operations, field technicians and related utility and maintenance charges. • Interconnection Costs. We pay other telecommunications companies and third-party providers for leased facilities and usage-based charges for transporting and terminating network traffic from our cell sites and switching centers. We have pre-negotiated rates for transport and termination of calls originated by our customers, including negotiated interconnection agreements with relevant exchange carriers in each of our service areas. • Variable Long Distance. We pay charges to other telecommunications companies for long distance service provided to our customers. These variable charges are based on our customers’ usage, applied at pre-negotiated rates with the long distance carriers. • Customer Support. We pay charges to nationally recognized third-party providers for customer care, billing and payment processing services. Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment primarily includes the cost of handsets and accessories purchased from third-party vendors to resell to our customers and independent retailers in connection with our services. We do not manufacture any of this equipment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling expenses include advertising and promotional costs associated with marketing and selling to new customers and fixed charges such as retail store rent and retail associates’ salaries. General and administrative expenses include support functions including, technical operations, finance, accounting, human resources, information technology and legal services. We record stock-based compensation expense in cost of service and in selling, general and administrative expenses for expense associated with employee stock options and restricted stock awards, which is measured at the date of grant, based on the estimated fair value of the award. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service, which are seven to ten years for network infrastructure assets, three to ten years for capitalized interest, up to fifteen years for capital leases, three to eight years for office equipment, which includes software and computer equipment, three to seven years for furniture and fixtures and five years for vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the respective leases, which includes renewal periods that are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense includes interest incurred on our borrowings and capital lease obligations, amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of discounts and premiums on long-term debt. Interest income is earned primarily on our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. Income Taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we paid no federal income taxes. We have paid approximately $2.9 million, $3.1 million and $2.7 million of state income tax during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 70 Table of Contents Seasonality Our customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. Based on historical results, we generally expect net customer additions to be strongest in the first and fourth quarters. Softening of sales and increased customer turnover, or churn, in the second and third quarters of the year usually combine to result in fewer net customer additions. However, sales activity and churn can be strongly affected by the launch of new metropolitan areas, introduction of new price plans, and by promotional activity, which could reduce or outweigh certain seasonal effects.

(1) Cost of service and selling, general and administrative expenses include stock-based compensation expense. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cost of service includes $3.5 million and selling, general and administrative expenses includes approximately $43.0 million of stock-based compensation expense. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cost of service includes approximately $4.2 million and selling, general and administrative expenses includes approximately $43.6 million of stock-based compensation expense. 71 Table of Contents Service Revenues. Service revenues increased $559.3 million, or approximately 18%, to approximately $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in service revenues is primarily attributable to net customer additions of 1.5 million customers for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. Equipment Revenues. Equipment revenues increased $29.5 million, or 8%, to $379.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $350.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in upgrade handset sales to existing customers accounting for approximately $85.9 million. This increase was partially offset by lower average price of handsets activated reducing equipment revenues by approximately $17.7 million coupled with approximately $42.2 million that would have been recognized as service revenues but was classified as equipment revenues during the year ended December 31, 2009, in accordance with ASC 605, because the consideration received from customers was less than the fair value of promotionally priced handsets. Cost of Service. Cost of service increased approximately $103.9 million, or 9%, to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in cost of service is primarily attributable to the 23% growth in our customer base and the deployment of additional network infrastructure, including network infrastructure for 4G LTE, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and costs associated with our unlimited international calling product. Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment increased approximately $209.7 million, or approximately 24%, to approximately $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 from approximately $884.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to higher upgrade handset costs to existing customers which led to an approximate $248.2 million increase, partially offset by a decrease in gross customer additions accounting for an approximate $37.3 million decrease. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $54.0 million, or 9%, to approximately $621.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $567.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Selling expenses increased by $28.3 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in selling expenses is primarily attributable to a $37.0 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses as well as a $4.4 million increase in employee related costs to support our growth. These increases were partially offset by a $13.1 million decrease in MetroFLASH® expense. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $26.2 million, or approximately 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the growth in our business. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $71.9 million, or 19%, to $449.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $377.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase related primarily to an increase in network infrastructure assets placed into service during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 to support the continued growth and expansion of our network. Gain on Disposal of Assets. Gain on disposal of assets increased $34.1 million to $38.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from approximately $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in the gain on disposal of assets was primarily due to spectrum exchange agreements consummated during the year ended December 31, 2010, partially offset by a loss on disposal of assets related to certain network technology that was retired and replaced with newer technology during the year ended December 31, 2010. Non-Operating Items 2010 2009 Change (in thousands) Interest expense $ 263,125 $ 270,285 (3)% Loss on extinguishment of debt 143,626 — 100% Provision for income taxes 118,879 86,835 37% Net income 193,415 176,844 9% Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased approximately $7.2 million, or approximately 3%, to $263.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from approximately $270.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a $28.1 million reduction in interest expense on the senior secured credit facility as a result of a lower weighted average annual interest rate due to the interest rate 72 Table of Contents protection agreements that were effective on February 1, 2010, partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest of $13.0 million. Our weighted average interest rate decreased to 7.29% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 compared to 8.23% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Average debt outstanding for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $3.6 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $143.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was due to the redemption of $1.95 billion of outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 9 1/4% Senior Notes due 2014, or the 9 1/4% Senior Notes, during the year ended December 31, 2010. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense was approximately $118.9 million and approximately $86.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective tax rate was approximately 38.1% and 32.9% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, our effective rate differs from the statutory federal rate of 35.0% due to net state and local taxes, tax credits, non-deductible expenses,valuation allowance on impairment on investment securities and a net change in uncertain tax positions. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010 includes a benefit of $6.9 million related to income tax credits. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes a net decrease in a state unrecognized tax benefit of $18.1 million due to the expiration of a statute of limitations. Net Income. Net income increased approximately $16.6 million, or 9%, to $193.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $176.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to a 34% increase in income from operations combined with an approximate 3% decrease in interest expense, partially offset by an approximate 37% increase in provision for income taxes and a loss on extinguishment of debt. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Operating Items Set forth below is a summary of certain financial information for the periods indicated: 2009 2008 Change (in thousands) REVENUES: Service revenues $ 3,130,385 $ 2,437,250 28 % Equipment revenues 350,130 314,266 11 % Total revenues 3,480,515 2,751,516 26 % OPERATING EXPENSES: Cost of service (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below)(1) 1,120,052 857,295 31 % Cost of equipment 884,272 704,648 26 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below)(1) 567,730 447,582 27 % Depreciation and amortization 377,856 255,319 48 % (Gain) loss on disposal of assets (4,683 ) 18,905 125 % Total operating expenses 2,945,227 2,283,749 29 % Income from operations $ 535,288 $ 467,767 14 % (1) Cost of service and selling, general and administrative expenses include stock-based compensation expense. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cost of service includes $4.2 million and selling, general and administrative expenses includes $43.6 million of stock-based compensation expense. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cost of service includes $2.9 million and selling, general and administrative expenses includes $38.2 million of stock-based compensation expense. Service Revenues. Service revenues increased $693.1 million, or 28%, to $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in service revenues is primarily attributable to net customer additions of approximately 1.3 million customers for the year ended December 31, 2009. Offsetting these revenues, in accordance with ASC 605, is $42.9 million that would have been recognized as service revenues but was classified as equipment revenues during the year ended December 31, 2009, because the consideration received from customers was less than the fair value of promotionally priced handsets. 73 Table of Contents Equipment Revenues. Equipment revenues increased $35.8 million, or 11%, to $350.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $314.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in gross additions and an increase in upgrade handset sales to existing customers accounting for approximately $37.9 million. In addition, in accordance with ASC 605, approximately $42.9 million that would have been recognized as service revenues was classified as equipment revenues during the year ended December 31, 2009, because the consideration received from customers was less than the fair value of promotionally priced handsets. These increases were partially offset by lower average price of handsets activated reducing equipment revenues by approximately $45.6 million. Cost of Service. Cost of service increased approximately $262.8 million, or approximately 31%, to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $857.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in cost of service is primarily attributable to an approximate 24% growth in our customer base and the deployment of additional network infrastructure during the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and costs associated with our unlimited international calling product. Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment increased $179.6 million, or approximately 26%, to approximately $884.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $704.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in cost of equipment is primarily attributable to an increase in gross customer additions accounting for an approximately $145.5 million increase as well as higher upgrade handset costs to existing customers which led to an approximate $57.5 million increase. These increases were partially offset by the sale of lower priced handsets accounting for an approximate $30.0 million decrease in cost of equipment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $120.1 million, or approximately 27%, to $567.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $447.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Selling expenses increased by approximately $90.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in selling expenses is primarily attributable to an approximate $50.1 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses, an approximate $24.5 million increase in employee related costs and a $6.4 million increase in MetroFLASH® expense. General and administrative expenses increased $24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to the growth in our business. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $122.5 million, or 48%, to $377.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $255.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase is related primarily to network infrastructure assets that were placed into service during the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 to support the continued growth and expansion of our network. (Gain) loss on Disposal of Assets. Gain on disposal of assets increased approximately $23.6 million, or approximately 125%, to approximately $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from a loss on disposal of assets of $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The gain recognized during the year ended December 31, 2009 was due primarily to asset sales and FCC license exchanges consummated during the year, partially offset by the disposal of assets related to certain network technology that was retired and replaced with newer technology during the year ended December 31, 2009. The loss on disposal of assets for the year ended December 31, 2008 related to certain network equipment and construction costs that were retired.

The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an additional $550.0 million of 9 1/4% senior notes due 2014, or New 9 1/4% Senior Notes, that were issued in January 2009 and interest on capital lease obligations that were placed into service during the year ended December 31, 2009 as well as a decrease in capitalized interest expense. In addition, our weighted average interest rate increased to 8.23% for the year ended 74 Table of Contents December 31, 2009 compared to 7.78% for the year ended December 31, 2008, which includes the impact of our interest rate protection agreements. Average debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $3.5 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. Interest Income. Interest and other income decreased approximately $20.1 million, or 87%, to approximately $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from approximately $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to a decrease on the return on our cash balances as a result of a decrease in interest rates. Impairment Loss on Investment Securities. We can and have historically invested our substantial cash balances in, among other things, securities issued and fully guaranteed by the United States or the states, highly rated commercial paper and auction rate securities, money market funds meeting certain criteria, and demand deposits. These investments are subject to credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we made an original investment of $133.9 million in principal in certain auction rate securities, substantially all of which are secured by collateralized debt obligations with a portion of the underlying collateral being mortgage securities or related to mortgage securities. With the continued liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets, the auction rate securities held by us at December 31, 2009 continued to experience failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale in the auctions exceeded the amount of purchase orders. We recognized an additional other-than-temporary impairment loss on investment securities in the amount of approximately $2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense was approximately $86.8 million and approximately $130.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The effective tax rate was 32.9% and 46.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, our effective rate differs from the statutory federal rate of 35.0% due to net state and local taxes, tax credits, non-deductible expenses,valuation allowance on impairment on investment securities and a net change in uncertain tax positions. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes a net decrease in a state unrecognized tax benefit of $18.1 million due to the expiration of a statute of limitations. Net Income. Net income increased $27.4 million, or 18%, to $176.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to a 14% increase in income from operations, a 33% decrease in provision for income taxes and a 92% decrease in the impairment loss on investment securities, partially offset by an approximate 51% increase in interest expense and an approximate 89% decrease in interest and other income. Performance Measures In managing our business and assessing our financial performance, we supplement the information provided by financial statement measures with several customer-focused performance metrics that are widely used in the wireless industry. These metrics include average revenue per user per month, or ARPU, which measures service revenue per customer; CPGA, which measures the average cost of acquiring a new customer; cost per user per month, or CPU, which measures the non-selling cash cost of operating our business on a per customer basis; and churn, which measures turnover in our customer base. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures and a further discussion of the measures, please read “— Reconciliation of non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. The following table shows annual metric information for 2010, 2009 and 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Customers: End of period 8,155,110 6,639,524 5,366,833 Net additions 1,515,586 1,272,691 1,404,047 Churn: Average monthly rate 3.6% 5.5% 4.7% ARPU $ 39.79 $ 40.68 $ 41.39 CPGA $ 157.26 $ 145.79 $ 127.21 CPU $ 18.49 $ 17.23 $ 18.17 Customers. Net customer additions were 1,515,586 for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to 1,272,691 for the year ended December 31, 2009. Total customers were 8,155,110 as of December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately 23% over the customer total as of December 31, 2009. The increase in total customers is 75 Table of Contents primarily attributable to the continued demand for our service offerings. Net customer additions were 1,272,691 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 1,404,047 for the year ended December 31, 2008. Total customers were 6,639,524 as of December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately 24% over the customer total as of December 31, 2008. The increase in total customers in 2009 was primarily attributable to the continued demand for our service offerings and the launch of our services in the New York and Boston metropolitan areas in early 2009. Churn. As we do not require a long-term service contract, our churn percentage is expected to be higher than traditional wireless carriers that require customers to sign a one- to two-year contract with significant early termination fees. Average monthly churn represents (a) the number of customers who have been disconnected from our system during the measurement period less the number of customers who have reactivated service, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. We classify delinquent customers as churn after they have been delinquent for 30 days. In addition, when an existing customer establishes a new account in connection with the purchase of an upgraded or replacement phone and does not identify themselves as an existing customer, we count the phone leaving service as a churn and the new phone entering service as a gross customer addition (“false churn”). Churn for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 3.6%, compared to 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in churn was primarily related to the acceptance of our Wireless for All tax and regulatory fee inclusive service plans including a decline in false churn as we no longer offer the first month of service for free. Our customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. Based on historical results, we generally expect net customer additions to be strongest in the first and fourth quarters. Softening of sales and increased churn in the second and third quarters of the year usually combine to result in fewer net customer additions during these quarters. See – “Seasonality.” Average Revenue Per User. ARPU represents (a) service revenues plus impact to service revenues of promotional activity less pass through charges for the measurement period, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. ARPU was $39.79 and $40.68 for year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The $0.89 decrease in ARPU was primarily attributable to the new Wireless for All service plans that were introduced in January 2010, which include all applicable taxes and regulatory fees. ARPU was $41.39 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The $0.71 decrease in ARPU for the year ended December 31, 2009, was primarily attributable to higher participation in our Family Plans and promotional service plans offered during 2009, as well as reduced revenue from certain features included in our service plans that were previously provided a la carte. These decreases were partially offset by our unlimited international calling plan that launched in June 2009. Cost Per Gross Addition. CPGA is determined by dividing (a) selling expenses plus the total cost of equipment associated with transactions with new customers less equipment revenues associated with transactions with new customers during the measurement period adjusted for impact to service revenues of promotional activity by (b) gross customer additions during such period. Retail customer service expenses and equipment margin on handsets sold to existing customers when they are identified, including handset upgrade transactions, are excluded, as these costs are incurred specifically for existing customers. CPGA costs increased to $157.26 for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $145.79 for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase in CPGA was primarily driven by various promotional activities as well as lower gross additions. CPGA increased to $145.79 for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $127.21 for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was primarily driven by the launches of service in New York and Boston metropolitan areas in early 2009, combined with increased promotional activities. Cost Per User. CPU is determined by dividing (a) cost of service and general and administrative costs (excluding applicable stock-based compensation expense included in cost of service and general and administrative expense) plus net loss on handset equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. CPU for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $18.49 and $17.23, respectively. The $1.26 increase in CPU for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily driven by the increase in handset subsidies for upgrades by existing customers, the inclusion of regulatory fees in our Wireless for All service plans as well as costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade. CPU for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $18.17. The $0.94 decrease in CPU for the year ended December 31, 2009, was primarily driven by cost benefits due to the increasing scale of our business. However, these benefits were partially offset by the costs associated with our unlimited international calling plan as well as the launch expenses and ramp up of operations in the New York and Boston metropolitan areas. 76 Table of Contents The following table shows consolidated quarterly metric information for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010. Three Months Ended March 31,2009 June 30,2009 September 30,2009 December 31,2009 March 31,2010 June 30,2010 September 30,2010 December 31,2010 Customers: End of period 6,050,527 6,256,112 6,322,269 6,639,524 7,331,126 7,634,135 7,857,384 8,155,110 Net additions 683,694 205,585 66,157 317,255 691,602 303,009 223,249 297,726 Churn: Average monthly rate 5.0% 5.8% 5.8% 5.3% 3.7% 3.3% 3.8% 3.5% ARPU $ 40.40 $ 40.52 $ 41.08 $ 40.70 $ 39.83 $ 39.84 $ 39.69 $ 39.79 CPGA $ 134.23 $ 159.87 $ 153.94 $ 138.36 $ 146.18 $ 164.29 $ 160.54 $ 161.88 CPU $ 16.69 $ 16.82 $ 17.27 $ 18.06 $ 18.79 $ 17.90 $ 18.47 $ 18.83 Reconciliation of non-GAAP Financial Measures We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented. ARPU, CPGA, and CPU are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to judge our ability to meet our liquidity requirements and to evaluate our operating performance. We believe these measures are important in understanding the performance of our operations from period to period, and although every company in the wireless industry does not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures (which are common in the wireless industry) facilitate key liquidity and operating performance comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry. The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures with our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. ARPU — We utilize ARPU to evaluate our per-customer service revenue realization and to assist in forecasting our future service revenues. ARPU is calculated exclusive of pass through charges that we collect from our customers and remit to the appropriate government agencies. Average number of customers for any measurement period is determined by dividing (a) the sum of the average monthly number of customers for the measurement period by (b) the number of months in such period. Average monthly number of customers for any month represents the sum of the number of customers on the first day of the month and the last day of the month divided by two. ARPU for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, includes approximately $0.8 million and $42.9 million, respectively, that would have been recognized as service revenues but were classified as equipment revenues because the consideration received from customers was less than the fair value of promotionally priced handsets. The following table shows the calculation of ARPU for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands, except average number of customers andARPU) Calculation of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Service revenues $ 3,689,695 $ 3,130,385 $ 2,437,250 Add: Impact to service revenues of promotional activity 778 42,931 — Less: Pass through charges (91,167) (173,099) (136,801) Net service revenues $ 3,599,306 $ 3,000,217 $ 2,300,449 Divided by: Average number of customers 7,538,895 6,145,414 4,631,168 ARPU $ 39.79 $ 40.68 $ 41.39 77 Table of Contents Three Months Ended March 31,2009 June 30,2009 September 30,2009 December 31,2009 (In thousands, except average number of customers and ARPU) Calculation of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Service revenues $ 726,698 $ 766,850 $ 812,340 $ 824,498 Add: Impact to service revenues of promotional activity — 24,728 12,481 5,721 Less: Pass through charges (37,643) (39,641) (48,030) (47,785) Net service revenues $ 689,055 $ 751,937 $ 776,791 $ 782,434 Divided by: Average number of customers 5,685,830 6,185,166 6,303,075 6,407,637 ARPU $ 40.40 $ 40.52 $ 41.08 $ 40.70 Three Months Ended March 31,2010 June 30,2010 September 30,2010 December 31,2010 (In thousands, except average number of customers and ARPU) Calculation of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Service revenues $ 853,283 $ 922,137 $ 942,251 $ 972,024 Add: Impact to service revenues of promotional activity 778 — — — Less: Pass through charges (23,745) (24,189) (21,270) (21,963) Net service revenues $ 830,316 $ 897,948 $ 920,981 $ 950,061 Divided by: Average number of customers 6,949,153 7,513,202 7,734,525 7,958,700 ARPU $ 39.83 $ 39.84 $ 39.69 $ 39.79 CPGA — We utilize CPGA to assess the efficiency of our distribution strategy, validate the initial capital invested in our customers and determine the number of months to recover our customer acquisition costs. This measure also allows us to compare our average acquisition costs per new customer to those of other wireless broadband mobile providers. Equipment revenues related to new customers, adjusted for the impact to service revenues of promotional activity, are deducted from selling expenses in this calculation as they represent amounts paid by customers at the time their service is activated that reduce our acquisition cost of those customers. Additionally, equipment costs associated with existing customers, net of related revenues, are excluded as this measure is intended to reflect only the acquisition costs related to new customers. The following table reconciles total costs used in the calculation of CPGA to selling expenses, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to CPGA.

In addition, CPU provides management with a useful measure to compare our non-selling cash costs per customer with those of other wireless providers. We believe investors use CPU primarily as a tool to track changes in our non-selling cash costs over time and to compare our non-selling cash costs to those of other wireless providers, although other wireless carriers may calculate this measure differently. The following table reconciles total costs used in the calculation of CPU to cost of service, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to CPU.

At December 31, 2010, we had a total of approximately $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe that, based on our current level of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and our anticipated cash flows from operations, we have adequate liquidity, cash flow and financial flexibility to fund our operations in the near-term. On January 20, 2009, Wireless completed the sale of $550.0 million of the New 9 1/4% Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the sale of the New 9 1/4% Senior Notes were approximately $480.3 million. On July 16, 2010, Wireless entered into an Amendment and Restatement and Resignation and Appointment Agreement, or the Amendment, which amends and restates the senior secured credit facility. The Amendment amends the senior secured credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity of $1.0 billion of existing term loans under the senior secured credit facility to November 2016 as well as increase the interest rate to LIBOR plus 3.50% on the extended portion only. The remaining term loans under the senior secured credit facility will mature in 2013 and the interest rate continues to be LIBOR plus 2.25%. On September 21, 2010, Wireless completed the sale of $1.0 billion of principal amount of 7 7/8% Senior Notes due 2018, or the 7 7/8% Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the sale of the 7 7/8% Senior Notes were $973.9 million. Net proceeds from the sale of the 7 7/8% Senior Notes were used to redeem a portion of the outstanding 9 1/4% Senior Notes. On November 17, 2010, Wireless completed the sale of $1.0 billion of principal amount of 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2020, or the 6 5/8% Senior Notes. The net proceeds of the sale of the 6 5/8% Senior Notes were $987.9 million. In November 2010, Wireless completed the redemption of the remaining outstanding 9 1/4% Senior Notes. Our strategy has been to offer our services in major metropolitan areas and their surrounding areas, which we refer to as operating segments. We are seeking opportunities to enhance our current operating segments and to provide service in new geographic areas. From time to time, we may purchase spectrum and related assets from third parties or the FCC. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fully fund planned expansion. 80 Table of Contents The construction of our network and the marketing and distribution of our wireless communications products and services have required, and will continue to require, substantial capital investment. Capital outlays have included license acquisition costs, capital expenditures for construction, increasing the capacity, or upgrade of our network infrastructure, including network infrastructure for 4G LTE, costs associated with clearing and relocating non-governmental incumbent licenses, funding of operating cash flow losses incurred as we launch services in new metropolitan areas and other working capital costs, debt service and financing fees and expenses. Our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $790.4 million, $831.7 million and $954.6 million, respectively. The expenditures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 were primarily associated with our efforts to increase the service area and capacity of our existing network and the upgrade of our network to 4G LTE. The expenditures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were primarily associated with the construction of the network infrastructure in the Philadelphia, New York and Boston metropolitan areas and our efforts to increase the service area and capacity of our existing network. We believe the increased service area and capacity in existing markets will improve our service offerings, helping us to attract additional customers and retain existing customers resulting in increased revenues. As of December 31, 2010, we owed an aggregate of approximately $3.5 billion under our senior secured credit facility, 7 7/8% Senior Notes and 6 5/8% Senior Notes as well as $254.3 million under our capital lease obligations. Our senior secured credit facility defines consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as: consolidated net income plus depreciation and amortization; gain (loss) on disposal of assets; non-cash expenses; gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt; provision for income taxes; interest expense; and certain expenses of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. minus interest and other income and non-cash items increasing consolidated net income. We consider consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, to be an important indicator to investors because it provides information related to our ability to provide cash flows to meet future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and fund future growth. We present consolidated Adjusted EBITDA because covenants in our senior secured credit facility contain ratios based on this measure. Other wireless carriers may calculate consolidated Adjusted EBITDA differently. If our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA were to decline below certain levels, covenants in our senior secured credit facility that are based on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, including our maximum senior secured leverage ratio covenant, may be violated and could cause, among other things, an inability to incur further indebtedness and in certain circumstances a default or mandatory prepayment under our senior secured credit facility. Our maximum senior secured leverage ratio is required to be less than 4.5 to 1.0 based on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA plus the impact of certain new markets. The lenders under our senior secured credit facility use the senior secured leverage ratio to measure our ability to meet our obligations on our senior secured debt by comparing the total amount of such debt to our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which our lenders use to estimate our cash flow from operations. The senior secured leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of senior secured indebtedness to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by our senior secured credit facility. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, our senior secured leverage ratio was 1.54 to 1.0, which means for every $1.00 of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, we had $1.54 of senior secured indebtedness. In addition, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is also utilized, among other measures, to determine management’s compensation under their annual cash performance awards. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income, or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to, or more meaningful than cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. 81 Table of Contents The following table shows the calculation of our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our senior secured credit facility, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

In addition, for further information, the following table reconciles consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our senior secured credit facility, to cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In Thousands) Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 994,500 $ 899,349 $ 447,490 Adjustments: Interest expense 263,125 270,285 179,398 Non-cash interest expense (13,264) (11,309) (2,550) Interest income (1,954) (2,870) (22,947) Other expense, net 1,807 1,808 1,035 Other non-cash expense (1,929) (1,567) (1,258) Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable (2) (199) (8) Deferred rent expense (21,080) (24,222) (20,646) Cost of abandoned cell sites (2,633) (8,286) (8,592) Accretion of asset retirement obligation (3,063) (5,111) (3,542) Gain on sale and maturity of investments 566 644 — Provision for income taxes 118,879 86,835 129,986 Deferred income taxes (115,478) (110,161) (124,347) Changes in working capital (43,119) (138,952) 209,114 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,176,355 $ 956,244 $ 783,133 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased approximately $95.2 million to $994.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 from $899.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in operating income during the year ended December 31, 2010, partially offset by a decrease in cash flows provided by changes in working capital during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities increased approximately $451.9 million to approximately $899.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 from $447.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash flows from working capital changes and an increase in operating income during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $141.8 million to $447.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 from $589.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in working capital during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007, partially offset by an increase in operating income as a result of the growth experienced over the last twelve months. 82 Table of Contents Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $950.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was due primarily to a $74.8 million decrease in net purchases and maturities of short-term investments during the year ended December 31, 2010, coupled with a $61.3 million increase in cash flows from changes in prepaid purchases of property and equipment and an approximate $41.3 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to approximately $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was due primarily to a $313.0 million decrease in purchases of FCC licenses as well as a $122.9 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by an approximate $224.2 million increase in net purchases of short-term investments. Cash used in investing activities was $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $517.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was due primarily to $328.5 million in purchases of FCC licenses, $25.2 million in cash used for business acquisitions, a $186.9 million increase in purchases of property and equipment which was primarily related to construction in the Philadelphia, New York and Boston metropolitan areas, and $267.2 million in net proceeds from the sale of investments during the year ended December 31, 2007 that did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2008. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $176.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $449.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease during 2010 was mainly attributable to $2.0 billion in cash used for the redemption of the 9 1/4% Senior Notes as well as an approximate $62.4 million decrease in book overdraft, partially offset by a net $1.5 billion increase in proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. Cash provided by financing activities was $449.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $74.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was due primarily to $480.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the New 9 1/4% Senior Notes in January 2009, partially offset by an approximate $99.7 million decrease in book overdraft. Cash provided by financing activities was $74.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $1.2 billion for year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was due primarily to $818.3 million in net proceeds from the Company’s initial public offering that was completed in April 2007 and $420.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the additional notes in June 2007 that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Senior Secured Credit Facility Wireless, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MetroPCS Communications, Inc., entered into the Senior Secured Credit Facility on November 3, 2006, or senior secured credit facility. The senior secured credit facility consists of a $1.6 billion term loan facility and a $100 million revolving credit facility. The term loan facility is repayable in quarterly installments in annual aggregate amounts equal to 1% of the initial aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion. The term loan facility will mature in November 2013. The revolving credit facility will mature in November 2011. On July 16, 2010, Wireless entered into an Amendment and Restatement and Resignation and Appointment Agreement (the “Amendment”) which amends and restates the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Amendment amends the Senior Secured Credit Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity of $1.0 billion of existing term loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility to November 2016, increase the interest rate to LIBOR plus 3.50% on the extended portion only and reduce the revolving credit facility from $100.0 million to $67.5 million. The remaining term loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility will mature in 2013 and the interest rate for this portion continues to be LIBOR plus 2.25%. This modification did not result in a loss on extinguishment of debt. 83 Table of Contents The facilities under the senior secured credit agreement are guaranteed by MetroPCS Communications, Inc., MetroPCS, Inc. and each of Wireless’ direct and indirect present and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. The senior secured credit facility contains customary events of default, including cross defaults. The obligations are also secured by the capital stock of Wireless as well as substantially all of the present and future assets of Wireless and each of its direct and indirect present and future wholly-owned subsidiaries (except as prohibited by law and certain permitted exceptions). Under the senior secured credit agreement, Wireless will be subject to certain limitations, including limitations on its ability to incur additional debt, make certain restricted payments, sell assets, make certain investments or acquisitions, grant liens and pay dividends. Wireless is also subject to certain financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum senior secured consolidated leverage ratio and, under certain circumstances, maximum consolidated leverage and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios. In March 2009, Wireless entered into three separate two-year interest rate protection agreements to manage the Company’s interest rate risk exposure. These agreements are effective on February 1, 2010 and cover a notional amount of $1.0 billion and effectively convert this portion of Wireless’ variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at a weighted average annual rate of 5.246%. The monthly interest settlement periods will begin on February 1, 2010. These agreements expire on February 1, 2012. In October 2010, Wireless entered into three separate two-year interest rate protection agreements to manage the Company’s interest rate risk exposure. These agreements will be effective on February 1, 2012 and will cover a notional amount of $950.0 million and effectively convert this portion of Wireless’ variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at a weighted average annual rate of 4.612%. The monthly interest settlement periods will begin on February 1, 2012. These agreements expire on February 1, 2014. 9 1/4% Senior Notes Due 2014 On November 3, 2006, Wireless consummated the sale of $1.0 billion principal amount of its 9 1/4% senior notes due 2014, or initial notes. On June 6, 2007, Wireless consummated the sale of the additional notes. The initial notes and the additional notes are referred to together as the existing 9 1/4% senior notes. On January 14, 2009, Wireless completed the sale of the New 9 1/4% Senior Notes at a price equal to 89.50% of the principal amount of such new notes. On January 20, 2009, Wireless consummated the sale of the New 9 1/4% Senior Notes resulting in net proceeds of $480.3 million. The existing 9 1/4% senior notes together with the New 9 1/4% Senior Notes are referred to herein as the 9 1/4% Senior Notes. On September 21, 2010, Wireless completed a cash tender offer to redeem $313.1 million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 9 1/4% Senior Notes at a price equal to 104.625% for total cash consideration of $327.5 million. In November 2010, Wireless completed the redemption of the remaining $1.6 billion in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 9 1/4% Senior Notes at a price equal to 104.625% for total cash consideration of $1.7 billion. 7 7/8% Senior Notes due 2018 On September 21, 2010, Wireless consummated the sale of $1.0 billion of principal amount of 7 7/8% Senior Notes. The terms of the 7 7/8% Senior Notes are governed by the indenture and the first supplemental indenture, dated September 21, 2010, among Wireless, the guarantors party thereto and the trustee. The net proceeds of the sale of the 7 7/8% Senior Notes were $973.9 million after underwriter fees, discounts and other debt issuance costs of $26.1 million. The 7 7/8% Senior Notes are unsecured obligations and are guaranteed by MetroPCS, MetroPCS, Inc., and all of Wireless’ direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. Interest is payable on the 7 7/8% Senior Notes on March 1 and September 1 of each year. Wireless may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 7 7/8% Senior Notes at any time on or after September 1, 2014 for the redemption prices set forth in the indentures governing the 7 7/8% Senior Notes. In addition, prior to September 1, 2013, Wireless may, at its option, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 7 7/8% Senior Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain sales of equity securities or certain contributions to equity of Wireless.

Wireless may also, at its option, prior to November 15, 2015, redeem some or all of the notes at the redemption price set forth in the indentures governing the 6 5/8% Senior Notes. Capital Lease Obligations We have entered into various non-cancelable capital lease agreements, with expirations through 2025. Assets and future obligations related to capital leases are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in property and equipment and long-term debt, respectively. Depreciation of assets held under capital lease obligations is included in depreciation and amortization expense. Capital Expenditures and Other Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions Capital Expenditures. We currently expect to incur capital expenditures in the range of $650.0 million to $800.0 million on a consolidated basis for the year ending December 31, 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred approximately $790.4 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily associated with our efforts to increase the service area and capacity of our existing network and the upgrade of our network to 4G LTE in select metropolitan areas. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred approximately $831.7 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion and improvement of our existing network infrastructure and costs associated with the construction of new markets. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred $954.6 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion and improvement of our existing network infrastructure and costs associated with the construction of new markets. Other Acquisitions and Dispositions. On June 26, 2008, we were granted one 12 MHz 700 MHz license for a total purchase price of approximately $313.3 million. This 700 MHz license supplements the 10 MHz of AWS spectrum previously granted to us in the Boston-Worcester, Massachusetts/New Hampshire/Rhode Island/Vermont Economic Area as a result of FCC Auction 66. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we closed on various agreements for the acquisition and exchange of spectrum in the net aggregate amount of approximately $14.6 million and $21.8 million in cash, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received $52.3 million in fair value of FCC licenses in exchanges with other parties. On August 23, 2010, we closed on a like-kind spectrum exchange agreement covering licenses in certain markets with a service provider, or Service Provider. The Service Provider acquired 10 MHz of AWS spectrum in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas; Shreveport-Bossier City, Louisiana; and an additional 10 MHz of AWS spectrum in certain other Washington markets, as well as an additional 10 MHz of PCS spectrum in Sacramento, California. We acquired an additional 10 MHz of AWS spectrum in Santa Barbara, California; Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida; and 10MHz of AWS spectrum in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas and Shreveport-Bossier City, Louisiana. The exchange of spectrum resulted in a gain on disposal of assets in the amount of $19.2 million. On October 14, 2010, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire 10 MHz of AWS spectrum and certain related network assets adjacent to the Northeast metropolitan areas and surrounding areas for a total purchase price of $49.5 million. On November 1, 2010, we closed on the acquisition of the network assets and paid a total of $41.1 million in cash. On February 4, 2011, we closed on the acquisition of the 10 MHz of AWS spectrum and paid $8.0 million in cash. 85 Table of Contents On December 1, 2010, we closed on a like-kind spectrum exchange agreement covering licenses in certain metropolitan areas with the Service Provider. We acquired 10 MHz of AWS spectrum in Orlando in exchange for 10 MHz of PCS spectrum in Ft. Pierce-Vero Beach-Stuart, Florida, 10 MHz of partitioned AWS spectrum in the Salt Lake City and Portland cellular marketing areas and total cash consideration of $3.0 million. The exchange of spectrum resulted in a gain on disposal of assets in the amount of $26.6 million. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table provides aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010. Also, see Note 11 to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More Than 5 Years (In thousands) Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt, including current portion $ 3,532,000 $ 16,000 $ 552,364 $ 20,779 $ 2,942,857 Interest expense on long-term debt(1) 1,547,694 215,426 405,621 363,723 562,924 Purchase obligations (2) 127,104 109,421 9,026 8,657 0 Handset purchase commitment 9,426 9,426 0 0 0 Contractual tax obligations (3) 6,084 6,084 0 0 0 Capital lease obligations 491,365 30,077 62,863 66,692 331,733 Operating leases 2,337,246 312,706 613,776 600,707 810,057 Total cash contractual obligations $ 8,050,919 $ 699,140 $ 1,643,650 $ 1,060,558 $ 4,647,571 (1) Interest expense on long-term debt includes future interest payments on outstanding obligations under our senior secured credit facility, 7 7/8% Senior Notes and the 6 5/8% Senior Notes. The senior secured credit facility bears interest at a floating rate tied to a fixed spread to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate. The interest expense for the senior secured credit facility presented in this table is based on rates at December 31, 2010 and includes the impact of our interest rate protection agreements. (2) Includes expected commitments for future capital lease obligations and purchases of network equipment. (3) Represents the liability reported in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740 (Topic 740, “Income Taxes”). For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 14, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Inflation We believe that inflation has not materially affected our operations. Effect of New Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2011, the Company prospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2009-13, “Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements – a consensus of the EITF,” (“ASU 2009-13”) which amended ASC 605 (Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition”) to require overall arrangement consideration be allocated to each element in the multiple deliverable arrangement based on their relative selling prices, regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) or third party evidence (“TPE”). In the absence of VSOE or TPE, entities are required to estimate the selling prices of deliverables using management’s best estimates of the prices that would be charged on a standalone basis. The residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is eliminated; however the balance of revenue that can be recognized for the delivered element is limited to the non-contingent amount. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, including interest rates. We do not routinely enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading, speculative or hedging purposes, unless it is hedging interest rate risk exposure or is required by our senior secured credit facility. We do not currently conduct business internationally, so we are generally not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. 86 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $1.5 billion in outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility that bears interest at floating rates based on the London Inter Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.25% for the Term B-1 Tranche and LIBOR plus 3.50% for the Term B-2 Tranche. The interest rate on the outstanding debt under our senior secured credit facility as of December 31, 2010 was 4.597%, which includes the impact of our interest rate protection agreements. In March 2009, we entered into three separate two-year interest rate protection agreements to manage the Company’s interest rate risk exposure. These agreements were effective on February 1, 2010 and cover a notional amount of $1.0 billion and effectively convert this portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at a weighted average annual rate of 5.246%. The monthly interest settlement periods began on February 1, 2010. These agreements expire on February 1, 2012. If market LIBOR rates increase 100 basis points over the rates in effect at December 31, 2010, annual interest expense on the approximate $532.0 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate protection agreements would increase approximately $5.3 million.",2023-12-30 17:43:45.123225
1283699,TMUS,"T-Mobile US, Inc.",2013,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCompany OverviewExcept as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are those of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MetroPCS Wireless, Inc., or Wireless, and unless the context indicates otherwise, references to “MetroPCS,” “MetroPCS Communications,” “our Company,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer to MetroPCS Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.We are a wireless telecommunications carrier that currently offers wireless broadband mobile services primarily in selected major metropolitan areas in the United States, including the Atlanta, Boston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Orlando/Jacksonville, Philadelphia, Sacramento, San Francisco and Tampa/Sarasota metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2012, we hold licenses for wireless spectrum suitable for wireless broadband mobile services covering a total population of 144 million people in and around many of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States. In addition, we have roaming agreements with other wireless broadband mobile carriers that allow us to offer our customers service in many areas when they are outside our service area. These roaming agreements, together with the area we serve with our own networks, allows our customers to receive service in an area covering over 280 million in total population under the Metro USA® brand. We provide our services using code division multiple access (CDMA) networks using 1xRTT technology and evolution data optimized (EVDO) and fourth generation long term evolution (4G LTE).As a result of the significant growth we have experienced since we launched operations, our results of operations to date are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected in future periods. We expect that our number of customers will continue to increase over time, which will continue to contribute to increases in our revenues and operating expenses.We sell products and services to customers through our Company-owned retail stores as well as indirectly through relationships with independent retailers and third party dealers. Our service allows our customers to place unlimited local calls from within our local service area and to receive unlimited calls from any area while in our service area, for a flat-rate monthly service fee. Since January 2010, we have offered service under service plans which include all applicable taxes and regulatory fees and offering nationwide voice, text and web access services on an unlimited, no long-term contract, paid-in-advance, flat-rate basis beginning at $40 per month. For an additional $5 to $30 per month, our customers may select alternative service plans that offer additional features predominately on an unlimited basis. We also offer discounts to customers who purchase services for additional handsets on the same account. In January 2011, we introduced new 4G LTE service plans that allow customers to enjoy voice, text and web access services at fixed monthly rates starting as low as $40 per month. In 2012, we introduced a nationwide 4G LTE data, talk and text service plan for $25 per month, including all applicable taxes and regulatory fees. For additional usage fees, we also provide certain other value-added services. All of these plans require payment in advance for one month of service. If no payment is made in advance for the following month of service, service is suspended at the end of the month that was paid for by the customer and, if the customer does not pay within 30 days, the customer is terminated. We believe our service plans differentiate us from the more complex plans and long-term contract requirements of traditional wireless carriers.T-Mobile TransactionOn October 3, 2012, we announced we had entered into a Business Combination Agreement to combine our business with T-Mobile, or the Proposed Transaction. Upon completion of the Proposed Transaction, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2013, MetroPCS and T-Mobile will combine their respective businesses, will rename MetroPCS as T-Mobile US, and will operate T-Mobile and MetroPCS as separate customer units. The Business Combination Agreement is structured as a recapitalization, in which MetroPCS will declare a reverse stock split, make a cash payment of $1.5 billion in the aggregate to our stockholders of record immediately following the reverse stock split and acquire all of T-Mobile's capital stock by issuing a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom 74% of MetroPCS' common stock outstanding following the cash payment on a pro forma basis. Upon completion of the combination, MetroPCS stockholders will own 26% of the combined company. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. You should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 84Table of Contentsstatements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionOur wireless services are provided on a month-to-month basis and are paid in advance. We recognize revenues from wireless services as they are rendered. Amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Suspending service for non-payment is known as hotlining. We do not recognize revenue on hotlined customers.Revenues and related costs from the sale of accessories are recognized at the point of sale. The cost of handsets sold to indirect retailers are included in deferred charges until they are sold to and activated by customers. Amounts billed to indirect retailers for handsets are recorded as accounts receivable and deferred revenue upon shipment by us and are recognized as equipment revenues and related costs when service is activated by customers.Our customers have the right to return handsets within a specified time or within a certain amount of use, whichever occurs first. We record an estimate for returns as contra-revenue at the time of recognizing revenue. Our assessment of estimated returns is based on historical return rates. If our customers' actual returns are not consistent with our estimates of their returns, revenues may be different than initially recorded. Our reserves for returns were not significant as of December 31, 2011 or 2012.We have revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and follow the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13 ""Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements,"" or ASU 2009-13. ASU 2009-13 which amended the methodology upon which companies allocated revenue within arrangements with multiple deliverables under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, (Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition”), allowing for allocation based upon a selling price hierarchy that permits the use of an estimated selling price to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration to a deliverable in a multiple-deliverable arrangement where neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available for that deliverable, eliminating the residual method.We have determined that the sale of wireless services through our direct and indirect sales channels with an accompanying handset constitutes a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables. We divide these arrangements into separate units of accounting, and allocate the consideration between the handset and the wireless service. Under the amended provisions of ASU 2009-13, the amount allocable to the delivered unit or units of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specific performance conditions, or the non-contingent amount. We have considered our customer service policies and historical practices and concluded that the amount of consideration received related to service revenue is contingent upon delivery of the wireless service as the customer may receive a service credit if we did not deliver the service. Any remaining consideration received is recognized as equipment revenue when the handset is delivered and accepted by the customer as it represents the non-contingent amount. Delivery of the wireless service generally occurs over the one month period following delivery and acceptance of the equipment by the customer as we do not require our customers to enter into long-term contracts. The value allocable to the undelivered wireless service element is based on the monthly service amounts charged to customers. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts ReceivableWe maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our independent retailers to pay for equipment purchases, for amounts estimated to be uncollectible from other carriers for intercarrier compensation and for amounts estimated to be uncollectible from customers with mid-cycle plan changes where service has been provided prior to the receipt of payment based on billing terms. We estimate allowances for uncollectible accounts from independent retailers based on the length of time the receivables are past due, the current business environment and our historical experience. If the financial condition of a material portion of our independent retailers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific carrier's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record a specific allowance for intercarrier compensation against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. Total allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable as of December 31, 2012 was less than 1% of the total amount of gross accounts receivable.85Table of ContentsInventoriesWe write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value or replacement cost based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Write-downs for obsolescent and unmarketable inventory were not significant as of December 31, 2011 and 2012. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required.Deferred Income Tax Asset and Other Tax ReservesWe assess our deferred tax asset and record a valuation allowance, when necessary, to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future taxable income, reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, potential to carryback tax benefits and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period we made that determination.We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax returns are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and ultimately modified. We adjust the reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of income tax related reserve positions and changes to income tax reserves that we consider appropriate. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is finally resolved. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash or a reduction in our net operating loss carryforwards. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the effective rate in the year of resolution. Tax reserves as of December 31, 2012 were $8.0 million which are presented on the consolidated balance sheet in other long-term liabilities.Property and EquipmentDepreciation on property and equipment is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service, which are five to ten years for network infrastructure assets, three to ten years for capitalized interest, up to fifteen years for capital leases, approximately one to eight years for office equipment, which includes software and computer equipment, approximately three to seven years for furniture and fixtures and five years for vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease and any renewal periods reasonably assured or the estimated useful life of the improvement. The estimated life of property and equipment is based on historical experience with similar assets, as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. If technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation expense in future periods. Likewise, if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than anticipated, the life of the assets could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to property and equipment. This could result in a reduction of depreciation expense in future periods.We assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or in the strategy for our overall business, or indications of a significant decrease in market price. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations. In connection with the Proposed Transaction, an initial fair value assessment was performed by T-Mobile on our property and equipment and we determined that an undiscounted cash flow recoverability analysis should be performed in accordance with ASC 360 (Topic 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment”). As a result of that analysis, we concluded that the carrying value of our property and equipment was recoverable and there was no impairment as of December 31, 2012. The carrying value of property and equipment was approximately $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2012.Fair Value MeasurementsWe follow the provisions of ASC 820 (Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”). ASC 820 establishes a three-tiered fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. ASC 820 requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a financial instrument uses inputs 86Table of Contentsthat fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation.Intangible AssetsWe operate wireless broadband mobile networks under licenses granted by the FCC for a particular geographic area on spectrum allocated by the FCC for terrestrial wireless broadband services. We hold personal communications services, or PCS, licenses, advanced wireless services, or AWS, licenses, and 700 MHz licenses granted or acquired on various dates. The PCS licenses previously included, and the AWS licenses currently include, the obligation and resulting costs to relocate existing fixed microwave users of our licensed spectrum if the use of such spectrum interferes with their systems and/or reimburse other carriers (according to FCC rules) that relocated prior users if the relocation benefits our system. Accordingly, we incurred costs related to microwave relocation in constructing our PCS and AWS networks. FCC Licenses and related microwave relocation costs are recorded at cost. Although FCC licenses are issued with a stated term, ten years in the case of PCS licenses, fifteen years in the case of AWS licenses and approximately ten years for 700 MHz licenses, the renewal of PCS, AWS and 700 MHz licenses is generally a routine matter without substantial cost and we have determined that no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors exist as of December 31, 2012 that limit the useful life of our PCS, AWS and 700 MHz licenses. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are our PCS, AWS and 700 MHz licenses and microwave relocation costs. Based on the requirements of ASC 350 (Topic 350, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other”), we test investments in our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. We perform our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test as of each September 30th. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value with the carrying value. An impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related indefinite-lived intangible assets and charged to results of operations.We used an income approach, the Greenfield Methodology, to provide an indication of fair value for our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Such methodology is based on the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up operation and assumes that the only assets upon formation are the underlying FCC licenses, and that the business enterprise does not have any other assets including goodwill or going concern value at the date of inception. The start-up assumptions include utilization of the asset in its highest and best use and incorporate market participant assumptions for key factors, such as current and future technology, costs of telecommunications equipment, and workforce costs, considering the opportunities and constraints of the underlying spectrum as of the valuation date. Cash flow projections involve assumptions that include a degree of uncertainty, include future cash flows, long-term growth rates, appropriate discount rates and other inputs. We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use to estimate fair value. For the purpose of performing the annual impairment test as of September 30, 2012, our indefinite-lived intangible assets were aggregated and combined into a single unit of accounting, consistent with the management of the business on a national scope. No impairment was recognized as the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was in excess of their carrying value as of September 30, 2012. Historically, we have not experienced significant negative variations between our assumptions and estimates when compared to actual results. However, if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge associated with indefinite-lived intangible assets. Although we do not expect our estimates or assumptions to change significantly in the future, the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets or using a methodology other than a discounted cash flow model could result in different values for our indefinite-lived intangible assets and may affect any related impairment charge. The most significant assumptions within our discounted cash flow model are the discount rate, our projected growth rate and projected cash flows. A one percent decline in annual revenue, a one percent decline in annual net cash flows or a one percent increase in discount rate would not have resulted in impairment as of September 30, 2012.Indefinite-lived intangible assets must be tested between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in an entity's market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors. We reviewed changes in the business climate, changes in market capitalization, legal factors, operating performance indicators and competition, among other factors and their potential impact on our fair value determination. There have been no significant changes in any of these factors that have adversely affected any of the key assumptions used in our determination of fair value. Furthermore, if any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets are subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, we would test such assets for 87Table of Contentsimpairment in accordance with ASC 360, and the intangible assets would then be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life.For the license impairment test performed as of September 30, 2012, the aggregate fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets was in excess of the aggregate carrying values. There also have been no subsequent indicators of impairment, including those indicated in ASC 360, and accordingly no subsequent interim impairment tests were performed.Share-Based PaymentsWe account for share-based awards exchanged for employee services in accordance with ASC 718 (Topic 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation”). Under ASC 718, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period.We have granted restricted stock awards that entitle the holder to receive shares of common stock which become fully tradable upon vesting. The restricted stock awards granted generally vest on a four-year vesting schedule with 25% vesting on the first anniversary date of the award and the remainder pro-rata on a monthly or quarterly basis thereafter, subject to a service condition that relates only to vesting. The estimated compensation expense, which is equal to the fair value of the awards on the date of grant, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.We have also granted nonqualified stock options. Most of our stock option awards include a service condition that relates only to vesting. The stock option awards generally vest in three to four years from the grant date with 25% vesting on the first anniversary date of the award. Compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award.The determination of the fair value of stock options using an option-pricing model is affected by our common stock valuation as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. The Board of Directors uses the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant as the fair market value for our common stock. The volatility assumption is based on a combination of the historical volatility of our common stock and the volatilities of similar companies over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock options. The volatilities of similar companies are used in conjunction with our historical volatility because of the lack of sufficient relevant history equal to the expected term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. The expected term assumption is estimated based primarily on the stock options' vesting terms and remaining contractual life and employees' expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on the grant date appropriate for the term of the employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the expectation of no future dividend payouts by us.The value of the options is determined by using a Black-Scholes pricing model that includes the following variables: 1) exercise price of the instrument, 2) fair market value of the underlying stock on date of grant, 3) expected life, 4) estimated volatility and 5) the risk-free interest rate. We utilized the following weighted-average assumptions in estimating the fair value of the options grants for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011Expected dividends —% —%Expected volatility 60.00% 49.88%Risk-free interest rate 0.81% 2.06%Expected lives in years 5.00 5.00Weighted-average fair value of options: Granted at fair value $4.84 $6.49Weighted-average exercise price of options: Granted at fair value $9.52 $14.37The Black-Scholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions including expectations of future dividends and stock price volatility. Such assumptions are only used for making the required fair value estimate and should not be considered as indicators of future dividend policy or stock price appreciation. Because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, and because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of 88Table of Contentstraded options, the use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model may not provide a reliable estimate of the fair value of employee stock options.Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award.As share-based compensation expense under ASC 718 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it is reduced for estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We recognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $38.0 million, $41.8 million and $46.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Customer Recognition and Disconnect PoliciesUntil January 2010, when a new customer subscribed to our service, the first month of service was included with the handset purchase. Since January 2010, the first month of service is no longer included in the handset purchase. Under GAAP, we are required to allocate the purchase price to the handset and to the wireless service revenue. Generally, the amount allocated to the handset will be less than our cost, and this difference is included in cost per gross addition, or CPGA. We recognize new customers as gross customer additions upon activation of service. Prior to January 2010, we offered our customers the Metro Promise, which allowed a customer to return a newly purchased handset for a full refund prior to the earlier of 30 days or 60 minutes of use. In January 2010, we revised our Metro Promise policy to allow a customer to return a newly purchased handset for a full refund within 7 days of purchase and less than 60 minutes of use. Customers who returned their phones under the Metro Promise are reflected as a reduction to gross customer additions. Customers' monthly service payments are due in advance every month. Our customers must pay their monthly service amount by the payment date or their service will be suspended, or hotlined, and the customer will not be able to make or receive calls on our network. However, a hotlined customer is still able to make E-911 calls in the event of an emergency. There is no service grace period. Any call attempted by a hotlined customer is routed directly to our interactive voice response system and customer service center in order to arrange payment. If the customer pays the amount due within 30 days of the original payment date then the customer's service is restored. If a hotlined customer does not pay the amount due within 30 days of the payment date the account is disconnected and counted as churn. Once an account is disconnected we may charge a reconnect fee upon reactivation to reestablish service and the revenue associated with this fee is deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the customer. RevenuesWe derive our revenues from the following sources:Service. We sell wireless broadband mobile services. The various types of service revenues associated with wireless broadband mobile for our customers include monthly recurring charges for airtime, one-time or monthly recurring charges for optional features (including nationwide long distance, unlimited international long distance, unlimited text messaging, international text messaging, voicemail, downloads, ringtones, games and content applications, unlimited directory assistance, enhanced directory assistance, ring back tones, mobile Internet browsing, location based services, mobile instant messaging, navigation, video streaming, video on demand, push e-mail and nationwide roaming) and charges for long distance service. Service revenues also include intercarrier compensation and nonrecurring service charges to customers. Equipment. We sell wireless broadband mobile handsets and accessories that are used by our customers in connection with our wireless broadband mobile services. This equipment is also sold to our independent retailers to facilitate distribution to our customers.Costs and ExpensesOur costs and expenses include:Cost of Service. The major components of our cost of service are: •Cell Site Costs. We incur expenses for the rent of cell sites, network facilities, engineering operations, field technicians and related utility and maintenance charges.•Interconnection Costs. We pay other communications companies and third-party providers for leased facilities and usage-based charges for transporting and terminating network traffic from our cell sites and switching centers. We have pre-negotiated rates for transport and termination of calls originated by our customers, including negotiated interconnection agreements with relevant exchange carriers in each of our service areas.89Table of Contents•Variable Long Distance. We pay charges to other communications companies for long distance service provided to our customers. These variable charges are based on our customers’ usage, applied at pre-negotiated rates with the long distance carriers.•Roaming Costs. We pay charges to other wireless broadband mobile carriers for roaming services so our customers can receive wireless broadband mobile service when they travel outside our own network service area. •Customer Support. We pay charges to nationally recognized third-party providers for customer care, billing and payment processing services.Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment primarily includes the cost of handsets and accessories purchased from third-party vendors to resell to our customers and independent retailers in connection with our services. We do not manufacture any of this equipment.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling expenses include advertising and promotional costs associated with marketing and selling to new customers and fixed charges such as retail store rent and retail associates’ salaries. General and administrative expenses include support functions including technical operations, finance, accounting, human resources, information technology and legal services. We record stock-based compensation expense in cost of service and in selling, general and administrative expenses for expense associated with employee stock options and restricted stock awards, which is measured at the date of grant, based on the estimated fair value of the award.Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service, which are five to ten years for network infrastructure assets, three to ten years for capitalized interest, up to fifteen years for capital leases, approximately one to eight years for office equipment, which includes software and computer equipment, approximately three to seven years for furniture and fixtures and five years for vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease and any renewal periods reasonably assured or the estimated useful life of the improvement.Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense includes interest incurred on our borrowings and capital lease obligations, amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of discounts and premiums on long-term debt. Interest income is earned primarily on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.Income Taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 we paid no federal income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 we paid $6.5 million, $4.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of state income tax. SeasonalityOur customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. Based on historical results, we generally expect the net customer additions to be strongest in the first and fourth quarters. Softening of sales and increased customer turnover, or churn, in the second and third calendar quarters of the year usually combine to result in fewer net customer additions or in net customer losses. However, sales activity and churn can be strongly affected by the launch of new metropolitan areas, introduction of new price plans, competition, delays in tax refunds and other government benefits, general economic conditions and by promotional activity, which could reduce, accentuate, increase or outweigh certain seasonal effects. 90Table of ContentsMetroPCS Customer Statistics Net Additions (Losses) Customers (In 000s)2010 Q1 691 7,331Q2 303 7,634Q3 223 7,857Q4 298 8,1552011 Q1 726 8,881Q2 199 9,080Q3 69 9,149Q4 198 9,3472012 Q1 131 9,478Q2 (186) 9,292Q3 (312) 8,980Q4 (93) 8,887Results of OperationsYear Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 Operating ItemsSet forth below is a summary of certain financial information for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Change (in thousands) REVENUES: Service revenues $4,539,777 $4,428,208 3%Equipment revenues 561,501 419,174 34%Total revenues 5,101,278 4,847,382 5%OPERATING EXPENSES: Cost of service (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below)(1) 1,490,227 1,473,836 1%Cost of equipment 1,439,824 1,439,595 —%Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below)(1) 696,789 643,959 8%Depreciation and amortization 641,425 538,835 19%Loss on disposal of assets 9,044 3,619 150%Total operating expenses 4,277,309 4,099,844 4%Income from operations $823,969 $747,538 10% ————————————(1)Cost of service and selling, general and administrative expenses include stock-based compensation expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, cost of service includes $3.5 million and selling, general and administrative expenses includes $38.3 million of stock-based compensation expense.Service Revenues. Service revenues increased $111.6 million, or 3%, to approximately $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 from approximately $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in service revenues is primarily attributable to higher average subscribers as well as a $0.06 increase in average revenue per customer during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.Equipment Revenues. Equipment revenues increased $142.3 million, or 34%, to $561.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 from $419.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is primarily attributable to a $122.2 million increase in equipment revenues associated with a decrease in commissions paid to independent retailers due to a 91Table of Contentslower volume of handsets sold as well as higher average price of handsets sold, accounting for a $177.9 million increase. These items were partially offset by a 37% decrease in gross customer additions which led to a $132.2 million decrease, as well as a decrease in upgrade handset sales to existing customers, which led to a $24.7 million decrease.Cost of Service. Cost of service increased $16.4 million, or 1%, to approximately $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 from approximately $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in cost of service is primarily attributable to expenses associated with the deployment of additional network infrastructure, including network infrastructure for 4G LTE, as well as additional roaming expenses associated with Metro USA. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in long distance cost, as well as a decrease in taxes and regulatory fees during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment increased $0.2 million to approximately $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 from approximately $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is primarily attributable to a higher average cost of handsets accounting for a $309.6 million increase. This item was partially offset by a 37% decrease in gross customer additions which accounted for a $268.2 million decrease as well as a decrease in handset upgrades by existing customers which led to a $43.7 million decrease.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $52.8 million, or 8%, to $696.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 from $644.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Selling expenses increased by $5.8 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is primarily attributable to a $7.0 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $50.4 million, or 19%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to an increase in commissions paid to independent retailers for customer reactivations, coupled with an increase in legal and professional service fees which includes approximately $17.6 million in expenses incurred related to the T-Mobile Transaction.Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $102.6 million, or 19%, to $641.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 from $538.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase related primarily to network infrastructure assets placed into service during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 to support the continued growth and expansion of our network.Loss on Disposal of Assets. Loss on disposal of assets increased $5.4 million, or 150%, to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 from $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The loss on disposal of assets during the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was due primarily to the disposal of assets related to certain network technology that was retired and replaced with newer technology.Non-Operating Items Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Change (in thousands) Interest expense $275,494 $261,073 6%Gain on settlement 52,500 — 100%Loss on extinguishment of debt — 9,536 (100%)Provision for income taxes 213,286 178,346 20%Net income 394,172 301,310 31%Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $14.4 million, or 6%, to $275.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 from $261.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to a $4.1 million increase in interest expense on our senior secured credit facility, as amended, or Senior Secured Credit Facility, as a result of financing transactions that resulted in an increase in average debt outstanding to $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $4.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2011. In addition, capitalized interest expense decreased $7.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 when compared to the same period in 2011. Our weighted average interest rate decreased to 5.84% for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 6.09% for the year ended December 31, 2011. Gain on Settlement. In September 2012, we settled arbitration and litigation proceedings related to certain securities. Pursuant to the terms of the confidential settlement agreement, we received $52.5 million in cash in exchange for the release of all current and future claims that we may have relating to the sale of such securities to us, and we retain the rights to sell our investment in such securities at a later date.92Table of ContentsLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 was due to the repayment of $535.8 million in outstanding principal under the existing tranche B-1 term loans, or Tranche B-1 Term Loans, in May 2011. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense increased $35.0 million, or 20%, to $213.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 from $178.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The effective tax rate was 35.1% and 37.2% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal rate of 35.0% primarily due to net state and local taxes, non-deductible expenses, federal and state income tax credits, a release of a valuation allowance and a net change in uncertain tax positions. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal rate of 35.0% due to net state and local taxes, tax credits and state legislative changes. Provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 include a benefit of $1.2 million and $4.8 million, respectively, related to income tax credits.Net Income. Net income increased $92.9 million, or 31%, to $394.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $301.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to a 10% increase in income from operations as well as the $52.5 million gain on settlement, partially offset by a 20% increase in provision for income taxes.Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Operating ItemsSet forth below is a summary of certain financial information for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Change (in thousands) REVENUES: Service revenues $4,428,208 $3,689,695 20%Equipment revenues 419,174 379,658 10%Total revenues 4,847,382 4,069,353 19%OPERATING EXPENSES: Cost of service (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below)(1) 1,473,836 1,223,931 20%Cost of equipment 1,439,595 1,093,944 32%Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below)(1) 643,959 621,660 4%Depreciation and amortization 538,835 449,732 20%Loss (gain) on disposal of assets 3,619 (38,812) (109%)Total operating expenses 4,099,844 3,350,455 22%Income from operations $747,538 $718,898 4% ————————————(1)Cost of service and selling, general and administrative expenses include stock-based compensation expense. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cost of service includes $3.5 million and selling, general and administrative expenses includes $38.3 million of stock-based compensation expense. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cost of service includes $3.5 million and selling, general and administrative expenses includes $43.0 million of stock-based compensation expense.Service Revenues. Service revenues increased $738.5 million, or 20%, to approximately $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 from approximately $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in service revenues is primarily attributable to net customer additions of approximately 1.2 million customers for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 as well as a $0.78 increase in average revenue per customer compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.Equipment Revenues. Equipment revenues increased $39.5 million, or 10%, to $419.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $379.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in upgrade handset sales to existing customers as well as an increase in gross customer additions which led to a $90.2 million increase. This increase was partially offset by a lower average price of handsets sold accounting for $50.5 million. Cost of Service. Cost of service increased $249.9 million, or 20%, to approximately $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 from approximately $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in cost of service is 93Table of Contentsprimarily attributable to a 15% growth in our customer base and the deployment of additional network infrastructure, including network infrastructure for 4G LTE, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 as well as additional roaming expenses associated with Metro USA.Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment increased $345.7 million, or 32%, to approximately $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 from approximately $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in handset upgrades by existing customers and an increase in gross customer additions which led to a $192.0 million increase, as well as a higher average cost of handsets accounting for a $151.6 million increase. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $22.3 million, or 4%, to $644.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $621.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Selling expenses increased by $11.4 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in selling expenses is primarily attributable to a $6.9 million increase in employee related costs and a $5.2 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $15.5 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to the growth in our business.Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $89.1 million, or 20%, to $538.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $449.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase related primarily to network infrastructure assets placed into service during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 to support the continued growth and expansion of our network.Loss (gain) on Disposal of Assets. Loss on disposal of assets was $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to a gain on disposal of assets of $38.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The loss on disposal of assets during the year ended December 31, 2011 was due primarily to the disposal of assets related to certain network technology that were retired and replaced with newer technology. The gain on disposal of assets during the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to spectrum exchange agreements that were consummated during the period. Non-Operating Items Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Change (in thousands) Interest expense $261,073 $263,125 (1%)Loss on extinguishment of debt 9,536 143,626 (93%)Provision for income taxes 178,346 118,879 50%Net income 301,310 193,415 56%Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $2.0 million, or 1%, to $261.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $263.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a $36.7 million decrease in interest expense on our senior notes as a result of the redemption of our 9¼% senior notes due 2014, or 9¼% Senior Notes, in late 2010 and the issuance of new senior notes at a lower rate of interest. This decrease was partially offset by a $37.8 million increase in interest expense on the Senior Secured Credit Facility as a result of the issuance of a new tranche of term loans in the amount of $500.0 million, or Tranche B-3 Term Loans, in March 2011 as well as the issuance of an additional $1.0 billion of Tranche B-3 Term Loans, or the Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans, in May 2011. This increase in interest expense was partially offset by lower interest expense due to the repayment of $535.8 million of the Tranche B-1 Term Loans in May 2011. Our weighted average interest rate decreased to 6.09% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 compared to 7.29% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. Average debt outstanding for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was approximately $4.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 was due to the repayment of $535.8 million in outstanding principal under the Tranche B-1 Term Loans in May 2011. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $143.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was due to the redemption of $1.95 billion of outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 9¼% Senior Notes during the year ended December 31, 2010.Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense was $178.3 million and $118.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The effective tax rate was 37.2% and 38.1% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal rate of 35.0% primarily due to net state and local taxes, tax credits and state legislative changes. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal rate of 35.0% due to net state and local taxes, tax credits and non-94Table of Contentsdeductible expenses. Provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 include a benefit of $4.8 million and $6.9 million, respectively, related to income tax credits. Net Income. Net income increased $107.9 million, or 56%, to $301.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $193.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to a 93% decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt and an increase in income from operations, partially offset by a 50% increase in provision for income taxes.Performance MeasuresIn managing our business and assessing our financial performance, we supplement the information provided by financial statement measures with several customer-focused performance metrics that we believe are widely used in the wireless industry. These metrics include average revenue per user per month, or ARPU, which measures service revenue per customer; cost per gross customer addition, or CPGA, which measures the average cost of acquiring a new customer; cost per user per month, or CPU, which measures the non-selling cash cost of operating our business on a per customer basis; churn, which measures turnover in our customer base; and Adjusted EBITDA, which measures the financial performance of our operations. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures and a further discussion of the measures, please read “— Reconciliation of non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.The following table shows metric information for the year ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010Customers: End of period 8,886,723 9,346,659 8,155,110Net (losses) additions (459,936) 1,191,549 1,515,586Churn: Average monthly rate 3.4% 3.8% 3.6%ARPU $40.63 $40.57 $39.79CPGA $216.15 $173.11 $157.26CPU $20.38 $19.56 $18.49Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands) $1,512,412 $1,331,783 $1,176,355Customers. Net customer losses were 459,936 for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to net customer additions of 1,191,549 for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease in customer additions, we believe, is primarily attributable to our focus on generating Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow versus customer growth, competitive pressures, continued economic pressures and lack of economic recovery and customer expectations for high speed 4G data service. Total customers were 8,886,723 as of December 31, 2012, a decrease of 5% over the customer total as of December 31, 2011. Net customer additions were 1,191,549 for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 1,515,586 for the year ended December 31, 2010. Total customers were 9,346,659 as of December 31, 2011, an increase of 15% over the customer total as of December 31, 2010. The increase in total customers in 2011 was primarily attributable to the continued demand for our service offerings. Churn. As we do not require a long-term service contract, we expect our churn percentage to be higher than traditional wireless carriers that require customers to sign a one- to two-year contract with significant early termination fees. Average monthly churn represents (a) the number of customers who have been disconnected from our system during the measurement period less the number of customers who have reactivated service, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. We classify delinquent customers as churn after they have been delinquent for 30 days. In addition, when an existing customer establishes a new account in connection with the purchase of an upgraded or replacement phone and does not identify themselves as an existing customer, we count the phone leaving service as a churn and the new phone entering service as a gross customer addition (“false churn”). Churn for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 3.4%, compared to 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease in churn was primarily driven by continued investments in our network and lower subscriber growth during the year ended December 31, 2012. Churn for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 3.8%, compared to 3.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in churn was primarily driven by an increase in gross additions, adjusted for false churn, in the first nine months of 2011 over the first nine months of 2010, and we believe continued economic pressures on our subscribers as well as increased data demands on our CDMA network driven by Android penetration. Our customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. Based on historical results, we generally expect the 95Table of Contentsnet customer additions to be strongest in the first and fourth quarters. Softening of sales and increased customer turnover, or churn, in the second and third calendar quarters of the year usually combine to result in fewer net customer additions or in net customer losses. See – “Seasonality.”Average Revenue Per User. ARPU represents (a) service revenues plus impact to service revenues of promotional activity less pass through charges for the measurement period, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. ARPU was $40.63 and $40.57 for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, an increase of $0.06. The $0.06 increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to continued demand for our 4G LTE service plans partially offset by promotional service plans. ARPU was $39.79 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The $0.78 increase in ARPU for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily attributable to the continued demand for our Wireless for All and 4G LTE service plans offset by an increase in family plan penetration from 32% of our customer base in 2010 to 45% of our customer base in 2011. Cost Per Gross Addition. CPGA is determined by dividing (a) selling expenses plus the total cost of equipment associated with transactions with new customers less equipment revenues associated with transactions with new customers during the measurement period adjusted for impact to service revenues of promotional activity by (b) gross customer additions during such period. Retail customer service expenses and equipment margin on handsets sold to existing customers when they are identified, including handset upgrade transactions, are excluded, as these costs are incurred specifically for existing customers. CPGA costs increased to $216.15 for the year ended December 31, 2012 from $173.11 for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in CPGA for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily driven by a 37% decrease in gross additions as well as increased promotional activities when compared to the same period in 2011. CPGA costs increased to $173.11 for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $157.26 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in CPGA for the year ended December 31, 2011, when compared to the same period in 2010, was primarily driven by increased promotional activities. Cost Per User. CPU is determined by dividing (a) cost of service and general and administrative costs (excluding applicable stock-based compensation expense included in cost of service and general and administrative expense) plus net loss on handset equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. CPU for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $20.38 and $19.56, respectively. The $0.82 increase in CPU for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily driven by the increase in retention expense for existing customers, an increase in costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade, an increase in commissions paid to independent retailers for customer reactivations and an increase in legal and professional service fees. These items were partially offset a decrease in long distance cost and taxes and regulatory fees. During the year we experienced $4.57 in CPU directly related to handset upgrades compared to $4.13 in the prior year. CPU for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $18.49. The $1.07 increase in CPU for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily driven by the increase in retention expense related to existing customers, costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and roaming expenses associated with Metro USA, offset by the continued scaling of our business. Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus depreciation and amortization; gain (loss) on disposal of assets; less stock-based compensation expense; gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt; provision for income taxes; interest expense; minus interest and other income and non-cash items increasing consolidated net income. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased to approximately $1.5 billion from approximately $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 and approximately $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010.The following table shows consolidated quarterly metric information for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012. Three Months Ended March 31, 2011 June 30, 2011 September 30, 2011 December 31, 2011 March 31, 2012 June 30, 2012 September 30, 2012 December 31, 2012Customers: End of period 8,881,055 9,079,865 9,149,249 9,346,659 9,478,313 9,292,251 8,979,960 8,886,723Net additions (losses) 725,945 198,810 69,384 197,410 131,654 (186,062) (312,291) (93,237)Churn: Average monthly rate 3.1% 3.9% 4.5% 3.7% 3.1% 3.4% 3.7% 3.6%ARPU $40.42 $40.49 $40.80 $40.55 $40.56 $40.62 $40.50 $40.86CPGA $157.28 $177.88 $193.95 $165.79 $235.45 $190.53 $202.24 $228.04CPU $19.79 $18.94 $19.52 $20.00 $22.87 $18.40 $18.38 $21.91Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands) $285,211 $357,293 $327,321 $361,958 $262,362 $476,689 $466,035 $307,32696Table of ContentsReconciliation of non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented.ARPU, CPGA, CPU and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to judge our ability to meet our liquidity requirements and to evaluate our operating performance. We believe these measures are important in understanding the performance of our operations from period to period, and although every company in the wireless industry does not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures (which are common in the wireless industry) facilitate key liquidity and operating performance comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry. The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures with our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP.ARPU — We utilize ARPU to evaluate our per-customer service revenue realization and to assist in forecasting our future service revenues. ARPU is calculated exclusive of pass through charges that we collect from our customers and remit to the appropriate government agencies.Average number of customers for any measurement period is determined by dividing (a) the sum of the average monthly number of customers for the measurement period by (b) the number of months in such period. Average monthly number of customers for any month represents the sum of the number of customers on the first day of the month and the last day of the month divided by two. ARPU for the year ended December 31, 2010 includes approximately $0.8 million that would have been recognized as service revenues but were classified as equipment revenues because the consideration received from customers was less than the fair value of promotionally priced handsets. We believe investors use ARPU primarily as a tool to track changes in our average revenue per customer and to compare our per customer service revenues to those of other wireless broadband mobile providers, although other providers may calculate this measure differently. The following table reconciles total revenues used in the calculation of ARPU to service revenues, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to ARPU.

This measure also allows us to compare our average acquisition costs per new customer to those of other wireless broadband mobile providers, although other providers may calculate this measure differently. Equipment revenues related to new customers are deducted from selling expenses in this calculation as they represent amounts paid by customers at the time their service is activated that reduce our acquisition cost of those customers. Additionally, equipment costs associated with existing customers, net of related revenues, are excluded as this measure is intended to reflect only the acquisition costs related to new customers. We believe investors use CPGA primarily as a tool to track changes in our average cost of acquiring new customers and to compare our per customer acquisition costs to those of other wireless broadband mobile providers, although other providers may calculate this measure differently. The following table reconciles total costs used in the calculation of CPGA to selling expenses, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to CPGA.

In addition, CPU provides management with a useful measure to compare our non-selling cash costs per customer with those of other wireless broadband mobile providers. We believe investors use CPU primarily as a tool to track changes in our non-selling cash costs over time and to compare our non-selling cash costs to those of other wireless broadband mobile providers, although other providers may calculate this measure differently. The following table reconciles total costs used in the calculation of CPU to cost of service, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to CPU.

This measurement, together with GAAP measures such as revenue and income from operations, assists management in its decision-making process related to the operation of our business. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income, or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other providers may calculate this measure differently.We believe that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate our overall operating performance and that this metric facilitates comparisons with other wireless communications companies. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a metric to evaluate and compensate our employees for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure, from period-to-period, our ability to provide cash flows to meet future debt services, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and fund future growth. The following tables illustrate the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to net income and cash flows from operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to Adjusted EBITDA.100Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (in thousands)Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $394,172 $301,310

sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and cash generated from operations. At December 31, 2012, we had a total of approximately $2.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe that, based on our current level of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and our anticipated cash flows from operations, we have adequate liquidity, cash flow and financial flexibility to fund our operations in the near-term.In July 2010, Wireless entered into an Amendment and Restatement and Resignation and Appointment Agreement, or the Amendment, which amended and restated the senior secured credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity of $1.0 billion of existing term loans, or Tranche B-2 Term Loans, under the senior secured credit facility to November 2016 as well as increase the interest rate to LIBOR plus 3.50% on the extended portion only and reduce the revolving credit facility from $100.0 million to $67.5 million. In September 2010, Wireless completed the sale of $1.0 billion of principal amount of 7 7/8% Senior Notes due 2018, or the 7 7/8% Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the sale of the 7 7/8% Senior Notes were $974.0 million. Net proceeds from the sale of the 7 7/8% Senior Notes were used to redeem a portion of the outstanding 9 1/4% Senior Notes.In November 2010, Wireless completed the sale of $1.0 billion of principal amount of 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2020, or the 6 5/8% Senior Notes. The net proceeds of the sale of the 6 5/8% Senior Notes were $988.1 million.In November 2010, Wireless completed the redemption of the remaining outstanding 9 1/4% Senior Notes.In March 2011, Wireless entered into the New Amendment which amended and restated the Senior Secured Credit Facility to, among other things, provide for the Tranche B-3 Term Loans, which will mature in March 2018 and have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75%. The New Amendment also increased the interest rate on the existing Tranche B-1 Term Loans and Tranche B-2 Term Loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility to LIBOR plus 3.821%. In addition, the aggregate amount of the revolving credit facility was increased from $67.5 million to $100.0 million and the maturity of the revolving credit facility was extended to March 2016. Net proceeds from the Tranche B-3 Term Loans were $490.2 million after underwriter fees, discounts and other debt issuance costs of approximately $9.8 million. The New Amendment modified certain limitations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility including limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, make certain restricted payments, sell assets, make certain investments or acquisitions, grant liens and pay dividends. In addition, Wireless is no longer subject to certain financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum senior secured consolidated leverage ratio. However, 103Table of Contentsunder certain circumstances, we could be subject to certain financial covenants that contain ratios based on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as defined by the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Under the New Amendment, the definition of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA has changed and no longer excludes interest and other income.In May 2011, Wireless entered into the Incremental Agreement which supplemented the Senior Secured Credit Facility to provide for the Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans which amount was borrowed on May 10, 2011. The Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% and will mature in March 2018. The Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans are repayable in quarterly installments of $2.5 million. A portion of the proceeds from the Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans was used to prepay the $535.8 million in outstanding principal under the Tranche B-1 Term Loans, with the remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes, including opportunistic spectrum acquisitions. The net proceeds from the Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans were $455.5 million after prepayment of the Tranche B-1 Term Loans, underwriter fees, other debt issuance costs of $7.9 million. The Incremental Agreement did not modify the interest rate, maturity date or any of the other terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facility applicable to the Tranche B-2 Term Loans or the existing Tranche B-3 Term Loans. Our strategy has been to offer our services in major metropolitan areas and their surrounding areas, which we refer to as operating segments. We are seeking opportunities to enhance our current operating segments and to provide service in new geographic areas generally adjacent to existing coverage areas. From time to time, we may purchase spectrum and related assets from third parties or the FCC. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fully fund planned capital investments including geographical expansion.The construction of our network and the marketing and distribution of our wireless communications products and services have required, and will continue to require, substantial capital investment. Capital outlays have included license acquisition costs, capital expenditures for construction or increasing the capacity of or upgrading our network infrastructure, including network infrastructure for 4G LTE, costs associated with clearing and relocating non-governmental incumbent licenses, funding of operating cash flow losses incurred as we launch services in new metropolitan areas and other working capital costs, debt service and financing fees and expenses. Our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $845.9 million, $889.8 million and $790.4 million, respectively. The expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were primarily associated with our efforts to increase the service area and capacity of our existing network and the continued upgrade of our network to 4G LTE. We believe the increased service area and capacity in existing markets will improve our service offerings, helping us to attract additional customers and retain existing customers resulting in increased revenues.As of December 31, 2012, we owed an aggregate of approximately $4.4 billion under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, 7 7/8% Senior Notes and 6 5/8% Senior Notes, as well as $321.7 million under our capital lease obligations.Gain on SettlementIn September 2012, we settled arbitration and litigation proceedings related to certain securities. Pursuant to the terms of the confidential settlement agreement, we received $52.5 million in cash in exchange for the release of all current and future claims that we may have relating to the sale of such securities to us, and we retain the rights to sell our investment in such securities at a later date.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities increased $119.6 million to approximately $1.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2012 from approximately $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is primarily attributable to a 31% increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, partially offset by a $54.9 million increase in cash flows used for changes in working capital during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.Cash provided by operating activities increased $67.3 million to approximately $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2011 from $994.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to a 56% increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, partially offset by an decrease in cash flows provided by changes in working capital during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010.104Table of ContentsInvesting ActivitiesCash used in investing activities decreased $163.5 million to $723.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 from $886.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was due primarily to a $134.4 million decrease in net cash outflows for purchases of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, coupled with a $52.5 million in cash received for the settlement related to certain securities that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2012. These items were partially offset by a $18.7 million increase in acquisitions of FCC licenses and microwave clearing costs as well as cash flows from net purchases of short-term investments decreasing $11.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.Cash used in investing activities was $886.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $950.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. Cash flows provided by net purchases of short-term investments increased $224.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, partially offset by a $99.4 million increase in purchases of property and equipment and a $90.0 million increase in cash outflows from changes in prepaid purchases of property and equipment.Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities was $33.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $971.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease is primarily attributable to $961.7 million in net proceeds from debt issuance during the year ended December 31, 2011 that did not recur during the same period in 2012, as well as a $53.0 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.Cash provided by financing activities was $971.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to cash used in financing activities of $176.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was due primarily to $961.7 million in net proceeds from debt issuance during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $47.4 million in net retirement of long-term debt during the same period in 2010 as well as a $86.2 million increase in cash provided by changes in book overdraft and a $49.0 million increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options.Senior Secured Credit FacilityWireless, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MetroPCS Communications, Inc., entered into a senior secured credit facility on November 3, 2006, or senior secured credit facility. The senior secured credit facility consisted of a $1.6 billion term loan facility and a $100 million revolving credit facility. The term loan facility was repayable in quarterly installments in annual aggregate amounts equal to 1% of the initial aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion. In July 2010, Wireless entered into the Amendment which amended and restated the senior secured credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity of the Tranche B-2 Term Loans under the senior secured credit facility to November 2016 as well as increase the interest rate to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 3.50% on the extended portion only and reduce the revolving credit facility from $100.0 million to $67.5 million. In March 2011, Wireless entered into the New Amendment which further amended and restated the Senior Secured Credit Facility, to, among other things, provide for the Tranche B-3 Term Loans, which will mature in March 2018 and have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75%. The New Amendment also increases the interest rate on the existing Tranche B-2 Term Loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility to LIBOR plus 3.821%. In addition, the aggregate amount of the revolving credit facility was increased from $67.5 million to $100.0 million and the maturity of the revolving credit facility was extended to March 2016. The New Amendment modified certain limitations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility including limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, make certain restricted payments, sell assets, make certain investments or acquisitions, grant liens and pay dividends. In addition, Wireless is no longer subject to certain financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum senior secured consolidated leverage ratio. However, under certain circumstances, we could be subject to certain financial covenants that contain ratios based on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as defined by the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Under the New Amendment, the definition of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA has changed and no longer excludes interest and other income.In May 2011, Wireless entered into the Incremental Agreement which supplements the Senior Secured Credit Facility to provide for the Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans which amount was borrowed on May 10, 2011. The Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% and will mature in March 2018. The Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans are repayable in quarterly installments of $2.5 million. A portion of the proceeds from the Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans were used to prepay the $535.8 million in outstanding principal under the Tranche B-1 Term Loans, with the remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes, including opportunistic spectrum acquisitions. The net proceeds 105Table of Contentsfrom the Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans were $455.5 million after prepayment of the Tranche B-1 Term Loans, underwriter fees, other debt issuance costs of approximately $7.9 million. The Incremental Agreement did not modify the interest rate, maturity date or any of the other terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facility applicable to the Tranche B-2 Term Loans or the existing Tranche B-3 Term Loans.The facilities under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are guaranteed by MetroPCS Communications, Inc., MetroPCS, Inc. and each of Wireless' direct and indirect present and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including cross defaults. The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are also secured by the capital stock of Wireless as well as substantially all of the present and future assets of Wireless and each of its direct and indirect present and future wholly-owned subsidiaries (except as prohibited by law and certain permitted exceptions).In March 2009, Wireless entered into three separate two-year interest rate protection agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. These agreements were effective on February 1, 2010 and covered a notional amount of $1.0 billion and effectively converted this portion of Wireless' variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at a weighted average annual rate of 5.927%. These agreements expired on February 1, 2012.In October 2010, Wireless entered into three separate two-year interest rate protection agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. These agreements were effective on February 1, 2012 and cover a notional amount of $950.0 million and effectively convert this portion of Wireless' variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at a weighted average annual rate of 4.908%. The monthly interest settlement periods began on February 1, 2012. These agreements expire on February 1, 2014.In April 2011, Wireless entered into three separate three-year interest rate protection agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. These agreements were effective on April 15, 2011 and cover a notional amount of $450.0 million and effectively convert this portion of Wireless’ variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at a weighted average annual rate of 5.242%. The monthly interest settlement periods began on April 15, 2011. These agreements expire on April 15, 2014.9¼% Senior Notes Due 2014In November 2006, Wireless consummated the sale of $1.0 billion principal amount of its 9¼% senior notes due 2014, or initial notes. On June 6, 2007, Wireless consummated the sale of an additional $400.0 million of 9¼% Senior Notes due 2014, or the additional notes. The initial notes and the additional notes are referred to together as the existing 9¼% senior notes. On January 20, 2009, Wireless consummated the sale of additional 9¼% Senior Notes, or New 9¼% Senior Notes, resulting in net proceeds of $480.3 million. The existing 9¼% senior notes together with the New 9¼% Senior Notes are referred to herein as the 9¼% Senior Notes. In September 2010, Wireless completed a cash tender offer to redeem $313.1 million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of the existing 9¼% Senior Notes at a price equal to 104.625% for total cash consideration of $327.5 million.

The net proceeds of the sale of the 7 7/8% Senior Notes were $974.0 million after underwriter fees, discounts and other debt issuance costs of $26.0 million.6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2020In November 2010, Wireless consummated the sale of $1.0 billion of principal amount of 6 5/8% Senior Notes. The terms of the 6 5/8% Senior Notes are governed by the indenture, the second supplemental indenture, dated November 17, 2010, the fourth supplemental indenture, dated December 23, 2010, and the sixth supplemental indenture, dated December 14, 2012, among Wireless, the guarantor's party thereto and the trustee. The net proceeds of the sale of the 6 5/8% Senior Notes were $988.1 million after underwriter fees, discounts and other debt issuance costs of approximately $11.9 million.106Table of ContentsConsent Solicitation In December 2012, Wireless commenced a consent solicitation, seeking to amend the indentures governing its 7 7/8% Senior Notes and 6 5/8% Senior Notes, or collectively, the Notes. Following the receipt of the requisite consents in the consent solicitation, Wireless, the guarantors named therein and the trustee entered into a Fifth Supplemental Indenture which will govern the 7 7/8% Senior Notes and a Sixth Supplemental Indenture which will govern the 6 5/8% Senior Notes, or Supplemental Indentures. Among other things, the Supplemental Indentures modified the definition of “Change in Control” in such indentures so that the consummation of the Proposed Transaction will not be considered a change in control under the indentures governing the Notes. The Supplemental Indentures, upon consummation of the Proposed Transaction, also conformed the covenants, events of default and other non-economic terms previously applicable to the Notes to certain covenants, events of default and other non-economic terms that are anticipated to apply to certain notes to be sold by T-Mobile to Deutsche Telekom. Further, the Supplemental Indentures also made certain other changes to the covenants, events of default and other non-economic terms of the Notes that will apply only until such time, if any, as the Notes are assumed by T-Mobile upon the consummation of the Proposed Transaction, but that will be permanent if the Proposed Transaction is not consummated. In connection with the consent solicitation, Wireless incurred $10.0 million in fees that were treated as deferred debt issuance costs and a cash outflow from financing activities in the statement of cash flows.Capital Lease ObligationsWe have entered into various non-cancelable capital lease agreements, with expirations through 2027. Assets and future obligations related to capital leases are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in property and equipment and long-term debt, respectively. Depreciation of assets held under capital lease obligations is included in depreciation and amortization expense. As of December 31, 2012, we had $11.3 million and $310.5 million of capital lease obligations recorded in current maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt, respectively.Capital Expenditures and Other Asset Acquisitions and DispositionsCapital Expenditures. We currently expect to incur capital expenditures in the range of $800.0 million to $900.0 million on a consolidated basis for the year ending December 31, 2013.During the year ended December 31, 2012, we incurred $845.9 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily associated with our efforts to increase the service area and capacity of our existing network and the continued upgrade of our network to 4G LTE. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred $889.8 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily associated with our efforts to increase the service area and capacity of our existing CDMA network and the upgrade of our network to 4G LTE.During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred $790.4 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were primarily associated with our efforts to increase the service area and capacity of our existing CDMA network and the upgrade of our network to 4G LTE in select metropolitan areas. Other Acquisitions and Dispositions. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we closed on various agreements for the exchange of spectrum including a net aggregate amount of $3.0 million in cash consideration paid. The spectrum exchanges resulted in a gain on disposal of assets in the amount of $45.8 million.In October 2010, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire 10 MHz of AWS spectrum and certain related network assets adjacent to the Northeast metropolitan areas and surrounding areas for a total purchase price of $49.2 million. In November 2010, we closed on the acquisition of the network assets and paid a total of $41.1 million in cash. In February 2011, we closed on the acquisition of the 10 MHz of AWS spectrum and paid $8.0 million in cash. In June 2011, we completed a final settlement of costs and received $0.5 million in cash as reimbursement for pre-acquisition payments made on behalf of the seller.During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company closed on the acquisition of microwave spectrum including a net aggregate amount of $22.0 million in cash consideration paid.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.107Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and Commercial CommitmentsThe following table provides aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility bears interest at a floating rate tied to a fixed spread to LIBOR. The interest expense for the Senior Secured Credit Facility presented in this table is based on rates at December 31, 2012 and includes the impact of our interest rate protection agreements.(2)Includes expected commitments for future capital lease obligations and purchases of network equipment.(3)Represents the liability reported in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740 (Topic 740, “Income Taxes”). For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 15, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.(4)Includes various broadband services, sponsorship and managed service agreements with various vendors.InflationWe believe that inflation has not materially affected our operations.Effect of New Accounting StandardsIn May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, ""Fair Value Measurement - Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs,"" addressing how to measure fair value and what disclosures to provide about fair value measurements. This amendment is largely consistent with the existing GAAP guidance, but aligned the international guidance and eliminated unnecessary wording differences between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS""). The amendment was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, and should be applied prospectively. The implementation of this standard did not affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05 ""Statement of Comprehensive Income,"" which revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements, requiring entities to report components of comprehensive income in either (1) a continuous statement of comprehensive income or (2) two separate but consecutive statements. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2011 and should be applied retrospectively. The implementation of this standard did not affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.In July 2012, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2012-02, ""Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment,"" allowing entities to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether the quantitative test is required, as opposed to required annual quantitative impairment testing. The amendment was effective for interim and annual impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. We did not elect to utilize a qualitative assessment and have performed the annual quantitative impairment test as of September 30, consistent with prior years. The implementation of this standard did not affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.108Table of ContentsFair Value MeasurementsWe do not expect changes in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets and liabilities to have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 10 to the financial statements included in this report.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, including interest rates. We do not routinely enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading, speculative or hedging purposes, unless it is hedging our interest rate risk exposure under, or is required by, our Senior Secured Credit Facility. We do not currently conduct business internationally, so we are generally not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk.As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $2.5 billion in outstanding indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facility that bears interest at floating rates based on LIBOR plus 3.821% for the Tranche B-2 Term Loans and LIBOR plus 3.75% for the Tranche B-3 Term Loans and Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans. The interest rate on the outstanding debt under our Senior Secured Credit Facility as of December 31, 2012 was 4.624%, which includes the impact of our interest rate protection agreements. In October 2010, Wireless entered into three separate two-year interest rate protection agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure. These agreements were effective on February 1, 2012, cover a notional amount of $950.0 million and effectively converted this portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at a weighted average annual rate of 4.908%. These agreements expire on February 1, 2014. In April 2011, Wireless entered into three separate three-year interest rate protection agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. These agreements were effective on April 15, 2011, cover a notional amount of $450.0 million and effectively convert this portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at a weighted average annual rate of 5.242%. These agreements expire on April 15, 2014. If market LIBOR rates increase 100 basis points over the rates in effect at December 31, 2012, annual interest expense on the approximately $1.0 billion in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate protection agreements would increase $10.5 million.",2023-12-30 17:44:19.688691

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsExcept as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. OverviewThe MD&A is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the three years ended December 31, 2013 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Unless expressly stated otherwise, the comparisons presented in this MD&A refer to the same period in the prior year. T-Mobile’s MD&A is presented in the following sections: •Financial Highlights•Other Highlights•Results of Operations•Performance Measures•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Contractual Obligations•Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements•Related Party Transactions•Restructuring Costs•Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates•Recently Issued Accounting Standards22Table of ContentsFinancial Highlights•Total revenues increased 24% to $24.4 billion in 2013 compared to $19.7 billion in 2012.•Service revenues increased 11% to $19.1 billion in 2013 compared to $17.2 billion in 2012.•Total net customer additions were 4,377,000 for year ended December 31, 2013, a significant improvement compared to 203,000 net customer additions in 2012.•Branded postpaid churn of 1.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013, a 70 basis point improvement compared to 2.4% in 2012.•Adjusted EBITDA of $4.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 consistent with 2012.•Cash capital expenditures for property and equipment were $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $2.9 billion in 2012.Other HighlightsUn-carrier value proposition – In March 2013, we launched phase 1.0 of our Un-carrier value proposition by introducing the unlimited Simple Choice plans, which do not require an annual service contract. Qualified customers are eligible for device financing with EIP, which provides customers with low out-of-pocket costs on popular devices. In July 2013, we unveiled phase 2.0 of our Un-carrier value proposition, JUMP!, a groundbreaking approach to provide more frequent phone upgrades. At the same time we launched Simple Choice No Credit, which provides families an affordable multi-line service option without credit checks. In October 2013, we unveiled phase 3.0 of our Un-carrier value proposition, which provides customers reduced calling rates from the United States to international destinations and reduced roaming fees, including 2G data while traveling abroad in over 100 countries at no extra cost. In November 2013, we began to offer the Apple iPad Air and iPad mini. In addition, every T-Mobile tablet user can receive up to 200 MB of free 4G LTE data every month for as long as they own their tablet and use it on our network, even if they are not yet a T-Mobile mobile internet customer. In January 2014, we launched phase 4.0 of our Un-carrier value proposition, which reimburses customers’ early termination fees when they switch from other carriers and trade in their eligible device. The reimbursement of early termination fees will be recorded as a reduction of equipment sales revenues, and will accordingly have a negative impact on both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.Business combination with MetroPCS – On April 30, 2013, the business combination of T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS was completed. See Note 2 – Business Combinations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The business combination united two wireless innovators with one common vision: to bring wireless consumers exciting new choices while delivering an exceptional experience. On May 1, 2013, the combined company, T-Mobile US, Inc., began trading on the NYSE under the ticker “TMUS.” Since the business combination, T-Mobile has achieved significant milestones in the integration of the MetroPCS business. In addition, we have extended the geographic presence of the MetroPCS brand to 30 additional markets and have launched more than 1,700 distribution points in these new markets as of December 31, 2013.New product offerings – In addition to the new products introduced through Un-carrier initiatives 1.0 through 4.0, we began selling the iPhone at all company-owned stores in combination with the new Simple Choice plans in April 2013. Additionally, in November 2013, we began to offer the Apple iPad Air and iPad mini, both with Wi-Fi + Cellular enabled network technology. In addition, we began to offer qualifying tablet owners up to 200 MB of free 4G LTE data every month for as long as they own their tablet and use it on our network.Debt and equity issuances – In connection with the business combination with MetroPCS, Deutsche Telekom recapitalized T-Mobile USA by retiring T-Mobile USA’s long-term debt to affiliates with an aggregate principal amount of $14.5 billion and all related derivative instruments in exchange for new senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $11.2 billion and additional paid-in capital. In August 2013 and November 2013, we completed offerings of new senior unsecured notes in aggregate principal amounts of $500 million and $2.0 billion, respectively. Also in November 2013, we completed a public offering of 72,765,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $25 per share. Spectrum purchases – In October 2013, we closed the purchase of 10 MHz of AWS spectrum from U.S. Cellular for $308 million in cash. The spectrum covers a total of 32 million people in 29 markets. In January 2014, we entered into agreements with Verizon for the acquisition of 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses in exchange for approximately $2.4 billion in cash and the transfer of certain AWS spectrum and PCS spectrum. The spectrum licenses to be acquired from Verizon cover more than 150 million people, including approximately 50% of the U.S. population and 70% of our existing customer base, in 23 markets. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, is expected to occur in mid-2014. These transactions are expected to further enhance our portfolio of U.S. nationwide broadband spectrum and enable the expansion of LTE coverage to new markets.23Table of ContentsResults of OperationsSet forth below is a summary of consolidated results: Year Ended December 31, PercentageChange 2013Versus 2012 PercentageChange 2012Versus 2011(in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Revenues Branded postpaid revenues $13,166 $14,521 $16,230 (9)% (11)%Branded prepaid revenues 4,945 1,715 1,307 NM 31 %Wholesale revenues 613 544 443 13 % 23 %Roaming and other service revenues 344 433 501 (21)% (14)%Total service revenues 19,068 17,213 18,481 11 % (7)%Equipment sales 5,033 2,242 1,901 124 % 18 %Other revenues 319 264 236 21 % 12 %Total revenues 24,420 19,719 20,618 24 % (4)%Operating expenses Cost of services, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below 5,279 4,661 4,952 13 % (6)%Cost of equipment sales 6,976 3,437 3,646 103 % (6)%Selling, general and administrative 7,382 6,796 6,728 9 % 1 %Depreciation and amortization 3,627 3,187 2,982 14 % 7 %MetroPCS transaction and integration costs 108 7 — NM NMImpairment charges — 8,134 6,420 NM 27 %Restructuring costs 54 85 — (36)% NMOther, net (2) (191) 169 (99)% NMTotal operating expenses 23,424 26,116 24,897 (10)% 5 %Operating income (loss) 996 (6,397) (4,279) NM 49 %Other income (expense) Interest expense to affiliates (678) (661) (670) 3 % (1)%Interest expense (545) — — NM NMInterest income 189 77 25 145 % NMOther income (expense), net 89 (5) (10) NM (50)%Total other expense, net (945) (589) (655) 60 % (10)%Income (loss) before income taxes 51 (6,986) (4,934) NM 42 %Income tax expense (benefit) 16 350 (216) (95)% NMNet income (loss) $35 $(7,336) $(4,718) NM 55 %NM – Not MeaningfulYear Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012RevenuesBranded postpaid revenues decreased $1.4 billion, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower average revenue per user (“ARPU”). See “Performance Measures” for a description of ARPU. Branded postpaid ARPU was negatively impacted by the growth of our Value and Simple Choice plans which have lower priced rate plans than other branded postpaid rate plans. Compared to other traditional bundled postpaid price plans, Value and Simple Choice plans result in lower service revenues but higher equipment sales at the time of the purchase as the plans do not include a bundled sale of a discounted handset. Branded postpaid customers on Value and Simple Choice plans more than doubled over the past twelve months to 69% of the branded postpaid customer base at December 31, 2013, compared to 30% at December 31, 2012. Branded prepaid revenues increased $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. Of the increase, approximately $2.9 billion was due to the inclusion of the operating results of MetroPCS since May 1, 2013. Excluding MetroPCS operating results, the increase for the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted primarily from an increase in average branded prepaid customers driven by the success of T-Mobile’s monthly prepaid service plans, including data services that also have higher ARPU. 24Table of ContentsWholesale revenues increased $69 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to growth of the average number of MVNO customers for the period. The increase in MVNO customers was due in part to growth of government subsidized Lifeline programs offered by our MVNO partners along with MVNO partnerships launched in the fourth quarter of 2012. However, a significant portion of our MVNO partners’ recent customer growth has been in lower ARPU products that result in revenues that do not increase in proportion with customer growth. Roaming and other service revenues decreased $89 million, or 21%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower early termination fees of $58 million due to the no annual service contract features of Simple Choice plans launched in March 2013. Additionally, international voice and domestic data revenues decreased due to rate reductions negotiated with certain roaming partners. Equipment sales increased $2.8 billion, or 124%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the number of handsets sold and an increase in the rate of customers upgrading their handset. Additionally, equipment sales increased due to growth in the sales of smartphones, which have a higher average revenue per unit sold as compared to other handsets. This was driven by our introduction of both the Apple iPhone 5 and the Samsung Galaxy S®4 in the second quarter of 2013, and the Apple iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c in the third quarter of 2013. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS’s operating results since May 1, 2013 contributed approximately $450 million to the increase in equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2013. We financed $3.3 billion of equipment sales revenues through equipment installment plans during the year ended December 31, 2013, a significant increase from $946 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 resulting from growth in Value and Simple Choice Plans. Additionally, customers had associated equipment installment plan billings of $1.5 billion in the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $450 million in the year ended December 31, 2012.Other revenues increased $55 million, or 21%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012 due primarily to an increase in imputed rental income on wireless communication tower sites. Operating ExpensesCost of services increased $618 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. Of the increase, approximately $800 million was due to the inclusion of the operating results of MetroPCS since May 1, 2013. Cost of services, excluding MetroPCS, decreased due to lower roaming expenses of $126 million related to reduced roaming rates negotiated with certain roaming partners. Additionally, due to the network transition to enhanced telecommunication lines with higher capacity, we were able to accommodate higher data volumes at a lower cost. Cost of equipment sales increased $3.5 billion, or 103%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. The increase in cost of equipment sales was primarily attributable to a 67% increase in the volume of handsets sold during the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was partially attributable to higher average cost per unit of each handset sold due in part to a 90% increase in the sale of smartphones units for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS’s operating results since May 1, 2013 contributed approximately $950 million to the increase in cost of equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2013. Selling, general and administrative increased $586 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. Of the increase, approximately $650 million was attributable to the inclusion of operating results of MetroPCS since May 1, 2013. Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding MetroPCS, decreased $61 million, or 1%, primarily driven by $241 million in lower bad debt expense, net of recoveries, as a result of improved credit quality of our customer portfolio. This decrease was partially offset by higher commission expenses driven by increased gross customer additions during the year ended December 31, 2013.Depreciation and amortization increased $440 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. Depreciation and amortization attributable to MetroPCS since May 1, 2013 was approximately $550 million. Depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding MetroPCS, decreased in 2013, as 2012 included increased depreciation expense due to the shortening of useful lives of certain network equipment to be replaced in connection with network modernization efforts. MetroPCS transaction and integration costs increased $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012 due primarily to personnel related costs associated with the change in control, professional services costs and network integration expenses associated with the business combination between T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS. See also 25Table of ContentsNote 2 – Business Combinations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Restructuring costs of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 were related to our 2013 cost restructuring program to align our operations to our new strategy and position the company for future growth. Costs associated with the 2013 restructuring program primarily consist of severance and other personnel-related costs. Restructuring costs of $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 related primarily to the consolidation of our call center operations in 2012. Other, net for the year ended December 31, 2013 reflects a $2 million gain on a spectrum license transaction. Other, net for the year ended December 31, 2012, respectively, reflects a $191 million gain due primarily to an AWS spectrum license exchange, partially offset by costs associated with the terminated AT&T acquisition of T-Mobile USA. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense to affiliates increased $17 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. Prior to the closing of the business combination with MetroPCS, Deutsche Telekom recapitalized T-Mobile USA by retiring its long-term debt to affiliates of $14.5 billion and all related derivative instruments, in exchange for new senior unsecured notes of $11.2 billion. Later in 2013, Deutsche Telekom sold the senior non-reset notes resulting in an aggregate principal reduction of $5.6 billion in long-term debt to affiliates. The increase in interest expense to affiliates was primarily due to losses related to the retirement of derivative instruments associated with the extinguishment of the long-term debt to affiliates prior to the business combination, and higher average interest rates on the new senior unsecured notes. See also Note 7 – Debt and Note 13 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Interest expense increased $545 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. The increase in interest expense is primarily the result of MetroPCS long-term debt assumed during the second quarter of 2013 in connection with the business combination, as well as new senior notes issued during 2013. Additionally, interest expense of approximately $200 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to the long-term financial obligation resulting from the Tower Transaction that closed on November 30, 2012. The Tower Transaction and related impacts are further described in Note 8 – Tower Transaction and Related Long-Term Financial Obligation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Interest income increased $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. The increase in interest income is primarily the result of the significant growth in handsets financed through our equipment installment plans for the year ended December 31, 2013. Deferred interest associated with our EIP receivables is imputed at the time of sale and then recognized over the financed installment term.Other income (expense), net increased $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. The increase in other income (expense), net was primarily due to the recognition of gains related to the retirement of derivative instruments associated with the pre-business combination long-term debt to affiliates. See also Note 7 – Debt and Note 13 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Income TaxesIncome tax expense decreased $334 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to lower pre-tax income, exclusive of impairment charges. The effective tax rate was 31.4% and (5.0)% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to the impact of the goodwill impairment recorded in 2012. Guarantor SubsidiariesPursuant to the indenture and the supplemental indentures, the long-term debt, excluding capital leases, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile US, Inc. (“Parent”) and certain of T-Mobile USA’s (“Issuer”) 100% owned subsidiaries (“Guarantor Subsidiaries”). In 2013, T-Mobile entered into an agreement with Cook Inlet Voice and Data Services, Inc. (“Cook Inlet”) to acquire all of Cook Inlet's interest in Cook Inlet/VoiceStream GSM VII PCS Holdings LLC, (“CIVS VII”), a fully consolidated Non-Guarantor Subsidiary. The transaction was completed in July 2013 and resulted in CIVS VII becoming an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of T-Mobile USA. CIVS VII was subsequently combined with, and the net assets transferred to, T-Mobile License LLC, a wholly-owned Restricted Subsidiary of 26Table of ContentsT-Mobile USA. As a result, the net assets of CIVS VII were included in the Guarantor Subsidiaries condensed consolidating balance sheet information. The guarantees of the long-term debt were unchanged by the transaction. See Note 14 – Guarantor Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information regarding the transaction.The financial condition of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries is substantially similar to the Company’s consolidated financial condition. Similarly, the results of operations of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries are substantially similar to the Company’s consolidated results of operations. The change in the financial condition of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries was primarily due to the transfer of the net assets of CIVS VII into the Guarantor Subsidiaries consolidating balance sheet information as described above. As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the most significant components of the financial condition of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries were property and equipment of $595 million and $678 million, respectively, spectrum licenses of none and $220 million, respectively, long-term financial obligations of $2.1 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, and stockholders’ equity of $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. The most significant components of the results of operations of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2013 were services revenues of $823 million, offset by costs of equipment sales of $552 million resulting in a net comprehensive loss of $52 million. Similarly, for the year ended December 31, 2012, services revenues of $712 million were offset by costs of equipment sales of $449 million, resulting in a net comprehensive income of $72 million. Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2011RevenuesBranded postpaid revenues decreased by $1.7 billion, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 9% year-over-year decline in the number of average branded postpaid customers. Branded postpaid revenues were also negatively impacted by the growth of our Value plans which have lower ARPU than our other branded postpaid rate plans. Compared to other traditional bundled price plans, Value plans result in lower service revenues over the service contract period, but higher equipment sales at the time of the sale, as Value plans do not include a bundled sale of a heavily discounted handset. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in data revenues from customer adoption of smartphones with accompanying data plans. Smartphone customers accounted for 61% of total branded postpaid customers at December 31, 2012, up from 49% at December 31, 2011. Branded prepaid revenues increased by $408 million or 31% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to the 21% growth of branded prepaid customers in 2012 driven by the success of our Monthly4G plans, which were introduced in the second quarter of 2011. In addition, branded prepaid ARPU increased by 11% during 2012.Wholesale revenues increased by $101 million, or 23% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to the 15% growth of average MVNO customers during 2012. Roaming and other service revenues decreased by $68 million, or 14% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower data roaming revenues due to rate reductions with certain roaming partners. Equipment sales increased by $341 million, or 18% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. Equipment sales increased in 2012 from higher revenue per unit sold on lower unit sales volumes. The higher revenue per unit sold was primarily attributable to equipment sales changes in connection with our Value plans. For each handset sold on a Value plan, we benefit from increased equipment revenue, compared to traditional bundled price plans that typically offer a discounted handset combined with higher service charges. Additionally, smartphone sales growth contributed to the year-over-year increase in equipment sales as smartphones have higher revenue per unit sold compared to other phones. Other revenues increased by $28 million, or 12% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase is primarily due to higher co-location rental income from leasing out space at our owned wireless communication towers to third parties.Operating ExpensesCost of services decreased by $291 million, or 6% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. The decrease was attributable to lower roaming expenses related to a decline in customer base and associated usage compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Additionally, due to the network transition to enhanced telecommunication 27Table of Contentslines in 2012, we were able to accommodate higher data volumes at a lower cost year-over-year resulting in lower cost of services.Cost of equipment sales decreased by $209 million, or 6% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to the 10% decline in handset unit sales volumes, partially offset by higher costs per handset sold from an increased share of smartphones sold in 2012. Selling, general and administrative increased by $68 million, or 1% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. The slight decrease was primarily attributable to lower employee-related expenses in 2012 as a result of restructuring initiatives implemented in the first half of 2012 and lower commissions costs from fewer branded postpaid customer gross customer additions in 2012. This increase was partially offset by higher advertising expenses associated with new promotional campaigns launched in 2012. Depreciation and amortization increased by $205 million, or 7% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase was due to additional depreciation of approximately $268 million recorded as a result of adjustments to useful lives on equipment to be replaced in connection with the network modernization efforts (See “Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates”). Impairment charges of $8.1 billion were recorded on goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to impairment charges of $6.4 billion recorded on goodwill and spectrum licenses for the year ended December 31, 2011. We determined that the business combination with MetroPCS announced in October 2012 was a triggering event for a goodwill impairment assessment. The fair value of T-Mobile USA implied by using the market value of MetroPCS and the exchange terms contemplated in the business combination agreement was less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, of T-Mobile's single reporting unit as of September 30, 2012. We used the fair value implied by the transaction to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit in step one of our goodwill impairment test. Because the first step in the impairment process indicated that the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the reporting unit as of September 30, 2012, we performed the second step in the goodwill impairment test. As a result of the second step of the impairment analysis, we concluded that the implied goodwill as of September 30, 2012 was $0, and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $8.1 billion. We attribute this impairment to the business impacts from the highly competitive environment in the U.S. wireless telecommunications industry and the ongoing challenges in attracting and retaining branded postpaid customers. Restructuring costs of $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 relate to consolidating our call center operations from 24 to 17 facilities, as well as restructuring and optimizing operations in other parts of the business in an effort to reduce operating costs. No restructuring costs were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2011. Other, net in the operating expenses section reflects the net effect of transaction-related gains and losses. The net gain of $191 million in 2012 primarily relates to a gain recorded on an AWS spectrum license exchange, partially offset by expenses associated with the terminated AT&T acquisition of T-Mobile USA. The net expense of $169 million in 2011 primarily related to employee-related costs associated with the terminated AT&T acquisition of T-Mobile USA. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense to affiliates was relatively consistent at $661 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $670 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Income TaxesIncome tax expense was $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to an income tax benefit of $216 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the tax benefit recorded in 2011 related to impairment charges on spectrum licenses. The effective tax rate was (5.0)% and 4.4% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the impact of the goodwill impairment recorded in 2012. Guarantor SubsidiariesThe financial condition of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries is substantially similar to the Company’s consolidated financial condition. Similarly, the results of operations of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries are substantially similar to the Company’s consolidated results of operations. As of December 31, 2012, the most significant components of the financial condition of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries were property and equipment of $678 million, spectrum licenses of $220 28Table of Contentsmillion, long-term financial obligations of $2.1 billion and stockholders’ equity of $1.0 billion. The most significant components of the results of operations of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2012 were services revenues of $712 million, offset by costs of equipment sales of $449 million resulting in a net comprehensive income of $72 million. Similarly, for the year ended December 31, 2011, services revenues of $635 million were offset by costs of equipment sales of $389 million, resulting in a net comprehensive income of $47 million. Performance MeasuresIn managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by the financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures. These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate key operating performance comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry.Total CustomersA customer is generally defined as a SIM card with a unique T-Mobile identity number which generates revenue. Branded customers include customers that are qualified either for postpaid service, where they generally pay after incurring service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance. Wholesale customers include M2M and MVNO customers that operate on our network, but are managed by wholesale partners. The following table sets forth the number of ending customers:(in thousands)December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011Customers, end of period Branded postpaid customers22,299 20,293 22,367Branded prepaid customers15,072 5,826 4,819Total branded customers37,371 26,119 27,186M2M customers3,602 3,090 2,429MVNO customers5,711 4,180 3,569Total wholesale customers9,313 7,270 5,999Total customers, end of period46,684 33,389 33,185Note: Certain customer numbers may not add due to rounding.The following table sets forth the number of net customer additions (losses): Year Ended December 31,(in thousands)2013 2012 2011Net customer additions (losses) Branded postpaid customers2,006 (2,074) (2,206)Branded prepaid customers328 1,007 321Total branded customers2,334 (1,067) (1,885)M2M customers512 660 556MVNO customers1,531 610 780Total wholesale customers2,043 1,270 1,336Total net customer additions (losses)4,377 203 (549)Acquired customers 8,918 — —Net customer additions, excluding customers of MetroPCS acquired as a result of the business combination, were 4,377,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to net customer additions of 203,000 in the same period in 2012. At December 31, 2013, we had approximately 46.7 million customers, a 40% increase from the customer total as of December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of MetroPCS’s customer base due to the completion of the business combination during the second quarter of 2013, which increased the branded prepaid customer base by 8,918,000. Additionally, the increase was the result of growth in all customer categories, as described below.Net customer additions were 203,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 549,000 net customer losses in the same period in 2011. At December 31, 2012, we had 33.4 million customers, an approximate 1% increase from the customer 29Table of Contentstotal as of December 31, 2011. The increase in total customers was primarily driven by lower branded customer churn and higher branded prepaid customer additions.Branded CustomersBranded postpaid net customer additions were 2,006,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013, an improvement compared to branded postpaid net customer losses of 2,074,000 for the same period in 2012. The significant improvement in customer development was attributable to improved branded postpaid churn, increased new customer activations and qualified upgrades of branded prepaid customers to branded postpaid plans. Branded postpaid net customer additions benefited from the launch of the Simple Choice plans as a component of the Un-carrier strategy as well as the introduction of the JUMP! program and launch of popular devices in 2013. These factors drove incremental gross additions for branded postpaid customers and improved churn as further described below. Branded postpaid net customer losses slightly improved to 2,074,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 2,206,000 for the same period in 2011. The decrease in branded postpaid net customer losses is primarily attributable to improved branded postpaid churn partially offset by fewer branded postpaid customer gross additions. The decline in customer gross additions was primarily a result of competitive pressure, including our competitors' advertising campaigns and promotional offerings such as handset discounts and the launch of the iPhone 5, which we did not carry until 2013. Branded prepaid net customer additions, excluding customers of MetroPCS acquired as a result of the business combination, were 328,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to branded prepaid net customer additions of 1,007,000 for the same period in 2012. The decrease was partly a result of qualified upgrades of branded prepaid customers to branded postpaid plans as the Un-carrier strategy eliminates annual service contracts to credit worthy customers that have historically been utilizing prepaid products. In addition, the robust competitive environment in the prepaid market resulted in higher branded prepaid customer deactivations, partially offset by higher branded prepaid gross customer additions due in part to the expansion of the MetroPCS brand, including the launch in 30 additional markets since the completion of the business combination.Branded prepaid net customer additions were 1,007,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 321,000 branded prepaid net customer additions for the same period in 2011. This significant improvement was due to the continued success of T-Mobile's Monthly4G plans that were launched in the second quarter of 2011. The Monthly 4G plans are a branded prepaid service offering that provides customers with a variety of plan choices including unlimited talk, text and web service on the T-Mobile nationwide 4G network at flat monthly rates without the requirement of an annual contract.WholesaleWholesale net customer additions were 2,043,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to wholesale net customer additions 1,270,000 for the same period in 2012. The growth in MVNO customers was due in part to government subsidized Lifeline programs offered by our MVNO partners along with ongoing growth from MVNO partnerships launched in the fourth quarter of 2012. MVNO partners often have relationships with multiple carriers and through steering their business towards carriers offering promotions can impact specific carriers’ results. Wholesale net customer additions were 1,270,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to net customer additions of 1,336,000 for the same period in 2011. The moderate decline in wholesale net customer additions was primarily due to fewer MVNO gross customer additions and higher M2M customer churn. MVNO customers grew, although at a slightly slower rate, in 2012 versus 2011. Increased M2M customer churn resulted primarily from M2M partners adjusting their lines of service to align with their customer demand. ChurnChurn is defined as the number of customers whose service was discontinued, expressed as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period. The number of customers whose service was discontinued is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored. We believe that churn, which is a measure of customer retention and loyalty, provides relevant and useful information and is used by management to evaluate the operating performance of our business. 30Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 20132013 2012 2011Branded postpaid churn1.7% 2.4% 2.7%Branded prepaid churn5.4% 6.4% 6.7%Branded postpaid churn was 1.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 2.4% for the year ended December 31, 2012. The significant improvements were due in part to the continued focus on churn reduction initiatives, such as improving network quality and the customer sales experience. Additionally, our no annual service contract Un-carrier strategy announced in the first quarter of 2013 gained positive traction with customers. We also began offering new handsets in 2013, such as Apple iPhone products and the Samsung Galaxy S4, which improved customer retention compared to the same periods in 2012. Branded postpaid churn was 2.4% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011. The year over year decrease in branded postpaid churn in 2012 was the result of the strategic phase-out of certain products that historically had higher churn and the continued focus on churn reduction initiatives. Additionally, in 2011 we experienced customer losses which were believed to have been related to uncertainty caused by the proposed, but ultimately terminated, acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&T.Branded prepaid churn was 5.4% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 6.4% for the same period in 2012. The decreases were primarily a result of the completion of the business combination with MetroPCS during the second quarter of 2013. MetroPCS customers are now the largest portion of the branded prepaid customer base and have historically had lower rates of churn than the historical T-Mobile branded prepaid business. Consequently, branded prepaid churn was impacted positively by the inclusion of MetroPCS customers. Branded prepaid churn was 6.4% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 6.7% for the same period in 2011. The improvement in branded prepaid churn in 2012 was primarily attributable to the success of our Monthly4G plans and the strategic phase-out of certain products, which historically had higher churn. Average Revenue Per User (“ARPU”)ARPU represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. We utilize ARPU to evaluate our per-customer service revenue realization and to assist in forecasting our future service revenues. We believe ARPU provides management with useful information to evaluate the service revenues generated from our customer base. The following tables illustrate the calculation of ARPU and reconciles these measures to the related service revenues, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to ARPU: Year Ended December 31,(in millions, except average number of customers and ARPU)2013 2012 2011Calculation of Branded Postpaid ARPU: Branded postpaid service revenues$13,166 $14,521 $16,230Divided by: Average number of branded postpaid customers (in thousands) and number of months in period 20,858 21,306 23,496Branded postpaid ARPU$52.60 $56.79 $57.56 Calculation of Branded Prepaid ARPU: Branded prepaid service revenues$4,945 $1,715 $1,307Divided by: Average number of branded prepaid customers (in thousands) and number of months in period 11,913 5,325 4,488Branded prepaid ARPU$34.59 $26.85 $24.27Branded postpaid ARPU decreased $4.19 for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to the continued adoption of Value and Simple Choice plans, which have lower ARPU than customers under traditional bundled plans. This was offset in part by increased data revenues from continued growth in smartphone penetration. Branded postpaid customers on Value and Simple Choice plans increased over the past twelve months, and at December 31, 2013, represented 69% of branded postpaid customers compared to 30% of branded postpaid customers at December 31, 2012.31Table of ContentsBranded postpaid ARPU decreased $0.77 for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. The decrease in branded postpaid ARPU was primarily due to the branded postpaid customer base migration to Value plans introduced in the third quarter of 2011, which have lower ARPU, partially offset by higher data revenues from the adoption of data plans and smartphone penetration. Branded prepaid ARPU increased $7.74 for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of MetroPCS customers which generate higher ARPU than T-Mobile’s other branded prepaid customers, as well as the growth of monthly prepaid service plans, which include data services and have higher ARPU than other pay-as-you-go prepaid plans. Branded prepaid ARPU increased $2.58 for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase in branded prepaid ARPU was primarily due to the growth of the Monthly4G plans, which include data services. T-Mobile's Monthly4G plans were introduced in the second quarter of 2011.Branded Cost Per Gross Addition (“CPGA”)Branded CPGA is determined by dividing the costs of acquiring new customers, consisting of selling expenses plus the loss on equipment sales related to acquiring new customers for the specified period, by gross branded customer additions during the period. The loss on equipment sales related to acquiring new customers consists primarily of the excess of handset and accessory costs over related revenues incurred to acquire new customers. Additionally, the loss on equipment sales associated with retaining existing customers is excluded from this measure as Branded CPGA is intended to reflect only the acquisition costs to acquire new customers. Branded CPGA is a non-GAAP measure utilized by our management to assess the financial investment in new customers and determine the number of months to recover customer selling costs. This measure also allows us to compare average acquisition costs per new customer to those of other wireless telecommunications providers. The following table reconciles total costs used in the calculation of Branded CPGA to customer selling expenses, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Branded CPGA: Year Ended December 31,(in millions, except gross customer additions and Branded CPGA)2013 2012 2011Selling, general and administrative$7,382 $6,796 $6,728Less: General and administrative expenses(3,425) (3,510) (3,543)Total selling expenses3,957 3,286 3,185Add: Loss on equipment sales Equipment sales(5,033) (2,242) (1,901)Cost of equipment sales6,976 3,437 3,646Total loss on equipment sales1,943 1,195 1,745Less: Loss on equipment sales related to customer retention(1,300) (903) (1,014)Loss on equipment sales related to customer acquisition643 292 731Cost of acquiring new branded customers$4,600 $3,578 $3,916Divided by: Gross branded customer additions (in thousands)14,355 9,083 9,234Branded CPGA$320 $394 $424Branded CPGA decreased $74 for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. The decrease was due primarily to the significant growth in branded customer gross additions which resulted in fixed selling costs, such as employee salaries and lease expense, being applied over a greater number of gross customer additions. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the loss on equipment sales related to customer acquisition, due to the increased volume of handset sales and higher per unit costs due to an increasing mix of higher cost smartphones being sold. Branded CPGA decreased $30 for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. Branded CPGA decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to decreases in the equipment subsidy loss related to customer acquisition as customers adopted Value plans. For each handset sold on the Value plan, T-Mobile benefited from increased equipment revenue, compared to traditional bundled price plans that typically offered a discounted handset combined with higher service charges. This decrease in Branded CPGA was partially offset by increases in advertising associated with new promotional campaigns launched in 2012. 32Table of ContentsBranded Cost Per User (“CPU”)Branded CPU is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management to evaluate the non-acquisition related cash expenses associated with ongoing business operations on a per customer basis, to track changes in these non-acquisition related costs over time, and to help evaluate how changes in business operations affect non-acquisition related costs per customer. The following table reconciles total costs used in the calculation of Branded CPU to cost of services costs, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Branded CPU: Year Ended December 31,(in millions, except average number of customers and Branded CPU)2013 2012 2011Cost of services$5,279 $4,661 $4,952Add: General and administrative expenses3,425 3,510 3,543Add: Loss on equipment sales related to customer retention1,300 903 1,014Total cost of serving customers$10,004 $9,074 $9,509Divided by: Average number of branded customers (in thousands) and number of months in period32,771 26,631 27,984Branded CPU$25 $28 $28 Branded CPU decreased $3 for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to operating costs being applied over greater average branded customers due to organic growth and the acquisition of MetroPCS customers in the second quarter of 2013 in connection with the completion of the business combination. Operating costs increased in 2013 but at a lesser rate than the increase in average branded customers. Cost of services increased primarily due to the inclusion of the operating results of MetroPCS since May 1, 2013 and a higher loss on equipment sales related to customer retention due to higher volumes of smartphone sales in 2013 that have higher per unit costs. For the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period of the prior year, general and administrative expenses decreased due to improvements in bad debt expense as described in “Result of Operations” and lower employee related costs as a result of restructuring initiatives implemented in the first half of 2012. Branded CPU was $28 for both the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Branded CPU was consistent year-over-year, however the cost of serving customers decreased by $435 million or 5% in 2012. The decrease in costs was primarily attributable to lower cost of service in 2012, described in “Results of Operations.” This decrease in costs was fully offset by the impact of a 1.4 million decline in the average branded customer base during 2012. Adjusted EBITDAWe define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense (net of interest income), tax, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and expenses that are not reflective of T-Mobile’s ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin, expressed as a percentage, is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. This measurement, together with GAAP measures such as revenue and operating income, assists management in its decision-making process related to the operation of our business. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a metric to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure, from period-to-period, our ability to provide cash flows to meet future debt services, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and fund future growth. We believe that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and that this metric facilitates comparisons with other wireless communications companies. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income, or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other wireless carriers may calculate this measure differently. 33Table of ContentsThe following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA: Year Ended December 31,(in millions)2013 2012 2011Net income (loss)$35 $(7,336) $(4,718)Adjustments: Interest expense to affiliates678 661 670Interest expense 545 — —Interest income(189) (77) (25)Other (income) expense, net(89) 5 10Income tax expense (benefit)16 350 (216)Operating income (loss)996 (6,397) (4,279)Depreciation and amortization3,627 3,187 2,982Impairment charges— 8,134 6,420MetroPCS transaction and integration costs108 7 —Restructuring costs54 85 —Stock-based compensation100 — —Other, net (1)— (130) 187Adjusted EBITDA$4,885 $4,886 $5,310Adjusted EBITDA margin26% 28% 29%(1)Other, net for the year ended December 31, 2012 represents a net gain on an AWS spectrum license purchase and exchange and transaction-related costs incurred for the terminated AT&T acquisition of T-Mobile USA. Other, net for the year ended December 31, 2011 represents AT&T transaction-related costs incurred from the terminated AT&T acquisition of T-Mobile USA. Other, net transactions may not agree in total to the other, net classification in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) due to certain routine operating activities, such as insignificant routine spectrum license exchanges that would be expected to reoccur, and are therefore not excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was consistent for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. The inclusion of MetroPCS’s operating results since May 1, 2013, contributed approximately $1.0 billion in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2013. Excluding the Adjusted EBITDA contributed by MetroPCS’s operating results, Adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by the reduction in service revenues, which declined primarily due to impacts from customers migrating to Value and Simple Choice plans, which result in lower ARPU. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by increases in cost of equipment sales from higher sales volumes, partially offset by increases in equipment sales. Increases in costs of equipment sales and equipment sales were driven by higher gross customer additions and the launch of new handsets in 2013. In addition, equipment sales increased in 2013 due to a higher proportion of customers choosing Value and Simple Choice plans for which we do not include a bundled sale of a discounted handset.Adjusted EBITDA decreased 8% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in service revenues, offset partially by equipment sales growth and operating expense reductions. The decline in services revenues was primarily the result of losses of branded postpaid customers and impacts from customers adopting Value plans. Equipment sales improved in 2012 due to a higher proportion of customers choosing Value plans for which we do not offer subsidies (discounts) on devices. Additionally, operating expenses decreased slightly in 2012 primarily due to lower cost of equipment sales driven by lower handset unit sales volumes, lower employee-related expenses and the effects of ongoing cost management programs. These combined operating expense reductions were partially offset by higher advertising and marketing expenses associated with new promotional campaigns and T-Mobile's rebranding initiatives.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, as well as proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and issuance of common stock in connection with public offerings. As of December 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents were $5.9 billion. In addition, we have entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom that allows for up to $500 million in borrowings. We expect our current sources of funding to be sufficient to meet the anticipated liquidity requirements of the Company in the next 12 months and intend to use our current sources of funding for general corporate purposes, including capital investments, enhancing our financial flexibility and opportunistically acquiring additional spectrum in private party transactions and government auctions. We determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating 34Table of Contentsresults, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment. We may seek to raise additional debt or equity capital to the extent our projections regarding our liquidity requirements change or on an opportunistic basis when there are favorable market conditions. Further, we may consider entering into factoring arrangements to sell certain service receivables as an additional source of liquidity.Prior to the completion of the business combination with MetroPCS on April 30, 2013, our sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with Deutsche Telekom included in accounts receivable from affiliates, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2012, our cash and cash equivalents were $394 million and short-term investments with Deutsche Telekom were $650 million. As of December 31, 2013, our total capital consisted of $20.2 billion in total debt, excluding long-term financial obligation related to the tower transaction, and stockholders’ equity of $14.2 billion. Prior to the closing of the business combination with MetroPCS, Deutsche Telekom effected a recapitalization of T-Mobile USA. T-Mobile USA’s long-term debt to affiliates, with a total principal balance of $14.5 billion, were extinguished and interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps related to the extinguished notes were settled, in exchange for $11.2 billion of new unsecured senior notes. In October 2013, Deutsche Telekom sold the senior non-reset notes in an aggregate principal amount of $5.6 billion to third parties. In addition, we issued $500 million of unsecured senior notes in August 2013 and $2.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in November 2013. See Note 7 – Debt and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Stockholders’ equity increased $8.1 billion from December 31, 2012 due to the effects of the recapitalization, the deemed issuance of stock to MetroPCS stockholders, issuance of common stock in connection with a public offering, exercise of stock options and issuance of stock units, and net income for the year ended December 31, 2013. As part of the recapitalization, Deutsche Telekom contributed to T-Mobile approximately $3.1 billion in additional paid-in capital. In connection with the business combination with MetroPCS, common stock representing approximately 74% of the outstanding shares of the combined company were issued to Deutsche Telekom. However, as the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition, stockholders’ equity reflects a $3.0 billion increase for shares deemed issued to MetroPCS stockholders in consideration for their minority share of the combined company. Additionally, as part of the business combination, we acquired $2.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and assumed long-term debt of MetroPCS with an aggregate fair value amount of $6.3 billion. In November 2013, we completed a public offering of 72,765,000 shares of common stock, including 6,615,000 common shares pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, for net proceeds of $1.8 billion.In January 2014, we entered into agreements with Verizon for the acquisition of 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses for approximately $2.4 billion in cash and the transfer of certain AWS spectrum and PCS spectrum. We intend to finance the cash consideration payable to Verizon, which is expected to close in mid-2014, with cash on hand as of December 31, 2013, including a portion of the net proceeds from our recent equity and debt offerings. The indentures governing the long-term debt, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the indentures and the supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt restrict the ability of the Issuer to loan funds or make payments to the Parent. However, the Issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the Parent under the terms of each of the indentures and the supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt. As of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants.Capital ExpendituresThe construction of our network and the marketing and distribution of our wireless communications products and services have required, and will continue to require, substantial amounts of liquidity. Our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure.The property and equipment capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relate to T-Mobile’s network modernization and deployment of 4G LTE in 2013. The capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2012 were primarily associated with the continued expansion of our network coverage. During 2012, we were developing plans to deploy 4G LTE in 2013 after the terminated AT&T transaction. As such, capital spending was lower in 2012 than in subsequent periods.35Table of ContentsWe expect cash capital expenditures for property and equipment to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.6 billion for the year ending December 31, 2014. This does not include purchases of spectrum, including the acquisition of 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses from Verizon for approximately $2.4 billion in cash and the transfer of certain AWS spectrum and PCS spectrum, which is expected to close in mid-2014.Cash FlowsThe following table shows cash flow information for the year ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: Year Ended December 31,(in millions)2013 2012 2011Net cash provided by operating activities$3,545 $3,862 $4,980Net cash used in investing activities(2,092) (3,915) (4,699)Net cash provided by financing activities4,044 57 —The historical cash flows of T-Mobile USA should not be considered representative of the anticipated cash flows of T-Mobile US, Inc., the combined company resulting from the business combination.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $3.9 billion for the same period in 2012. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities was driven by several factors. Our operating income, exclusive of non-cash items such as impairment charges and depreciation and amortization, declined compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of decreases in branded postpaid revenues. Net changes in working capital decreased slightly due to increases in EIP receivables, offset in part by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due in part to timing of vendor payments. Cash provided by operating activities was $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $5.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities in 2012 was driven by several factors. Our operating income, exclusive of non-cash items such as impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, and other non-cash charges, declined compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of decreases in branded postpaid revenues. In addition, we made payments of $193 million primarily for employee-related expenses as a result of the terminated AT&T transaction and paid $53 million for restructuring charges during 2012. Also contributing to the decrease was the significant increase in our customers choosing to finance their wireless handset purchases through our EIP during 2012 compared to 2011. Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities was $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $3.9 billion used in the same period in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to the $2.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents we acquired in connection with the business combination with MetroPCS. The decrease was partially offset by $1.1 billion higher purchases of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the same period in 2012, as a result of T-Mobile’s network modernization and deployment of 4G LTE in 2013 described above.Cash used in investing activities was $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $4.7 billion during the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to $1.4 billion less invested with Deutsche Telekom on a net basis (short term affiliate loan receivable, net) during 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease in funds invested with Deutsche Telekom in 2012 was the result of utilizing $1.2 billion accounts receivable from affiliates in exchange for rights to spectrum licenses from Deutsche Telekom. The rights to the spectrum licenses were received from AT&T as part of the break-up consideration of the terminated AT&T transaction for the sale of T-Mobile USA. The decrease in funds invested with Deutsche Telekom was offset by higher capital expenditures and expenditures for spectrum licenses in 2012 as a result of our network modernization plan launched in 2012 described above.Financing ActivitiesCash provided by financing activities was $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $57 million for the same period in 2012. The increase was primarily due to net proceeds of $2.5 billion from the issuance of long-term debt, $1.8 billion from the issuance of common stock in connection with a public offering, and proceeds of $137 million from the 36Table of Contentsexercises of stock options issued. The increase was offset by repayments of short-term debt for purchases of property and equipment of $244 million, $80 million relating to the purchase of Cook Inlet's interest in CIVS VII, and a distribution to Deutsche Telekom of $41 million in connection with the recapitalization of T-Mobile USA effected immediately prior to the completion of the business combination with MetroPCS.Cash provided by financing activities was $57 million during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to no cash provided for the year ended December 31, 2011. During 2012, T-Mobile completed a transaction to sell the rights to operate its wireless communication towers resulting in net cash proceeds received of $2.5 billion, of which T-Mobile distributed $2.4 billion to Deutsche Telekom. Contractual ObligationsCurrent accounting standards require disclosure of material obligations and commitments to making future payments under contracts, such as debt, lease agreements, and purchase obligations. See Note 7 – Debt and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.The following table provides aggregate information about T-Mobile’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013:(in millions)Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More Than 5 Years TotalLong-term debt (1)$— $— $1,500 $17,700 $19,200Interest expense on long-term debt1,171 2,429 2,429 3,178 9,207Financial obligation (2)164 328 328 1,303 2,123Non-dedicated transportation lines606 1,150 630 311 2,697Operating leases, including dedicated transportation lines2,199 4,007 3,403 5,233 14,842Capital lease obligations, including interest40 84 87 297 508Vendor financing arrangements226 — — — 226Purchase obligations (3)1,168 410 2,078 — 3,656Total contractual obligations$5,574 $8,408 $10,455 $28,022 $52,459(1)Represents principal amounts of long-term debt at maturity, excluding unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment, capital lease obligations and vendor financing arrangements. (2)Future minimum payments, including principal and interest payments and imputed lease rental income, related to the long-term financial obligation recorded in connection with the Tower Transaction. See Note 8 – Tower Transaction and Related Long-Term Financial Obligation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.(3)T-Mobile calculated the minimum obligation for certain agreements to purchase goods or services based on termination fees that can be paid to exit the contract. Termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due in less than one year, as this is the earliest T-Mobile could exit these contracts. This table does not include open purchase orders as of December 31, 2013 under normal business purposes.Certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. Other non-current liabilities have been excluded from the tables due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor of such payments. The purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase handsets and accessories, equipment, software, programming and network services, and marketing activities, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent T-Mobile’s entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which T-Mobile is contractually committed. Where T-Mobile is committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether it takes delivery, T-Mobile has included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements T-Mobile does not participate in or secure financing for any unconsolidated entities.Related Party TransactionsSee Note 11 – Related Party Transactions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding related party transactions.37Table of ContentsDisclosure of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act. Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law. As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2013 that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with Deutsche Telekom. We have relied upon Deutsche Telekom for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.Deutsche Telekom AG, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: Gostaresh Ertebatat Taliya, Irancell Telecommunications Services Company (“MTN Irancell”), Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran. For the year ended December 31, 2013, gross revenues of all Deutsche Telekom affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic with Iran were less than $10 million and estimated net profits were less than $3 million. In addition, Deutsche Telekom, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, operating a fixed line network in their respective European home countries (in particular Germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the Embassy of Iran in those European countries. Gross revenues and net profits recorded from these for the year ended December 31, 2013 were less than $0.4 million. We understand that Deutsche Telekom AG intends to continue these activities. Restructuring CostsSee Note 13 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding restructuring costs.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesPreparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the T-Mobile consolidated financial statements.AllowancesWe maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of customers to make required payments. When determining the allowance T-Mobile considers the probability of recovery based on past experience taking into account current collection trends and general economic factors. Collection risks are assessed for each type of receivable, including EIP receivables, based upon historical and expected write-offs, net of recoveries, and an analysis of the aged accounts receivable balances with reserves generally increasing as the receivable ages. To the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends or assumptions, the required allowance amounts could differ from the estimate. Total deferred interest and allowances as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 was approximately 8.6% and 9.6%, respectively, of the total amount of gross accounts receivable, including long-term EIP receivables.DepreciationDepreciation commences once assets have been placed in service and is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate that an asset’s useful life is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book values are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted 38Table of Contentsremaining estimated useful life. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 4 – Property and Equipment and Note 5 – Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding depreciation of assets, including underlying management estimates of useful lives. Evaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for ImpairmentT-Mobile assesses the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (spectrum licenses) for potential impairment annually as of December 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. T-Mobile uses a two-step process to determine a possible impairment of goodwill. In the first step, T-Mobile compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market method, which is based on market capitalization. Market capitalization is calculated based on the price of our common stock and number of common stock outstanding. The Company recognizes that market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. In the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. We believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value. Historically, the Company estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach due to the absence of comparable observable market data for T-Mobile. The discounted cash flow method utilizes future cash flow assumptions are based on estimates of revenues, EBITDA margin and a long-term growth rate taking into consideration expected industry and market conditions. The cash flows are then discounted using a weighted average cost of capital reflecting the risks associated with the business and the projected cash flows. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the second step of the test is performed. In the second step, T-Mobile determines the fair values of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including those that currently may not be recorded. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the sum of the fair value of all of those assets and liabilities represents the implied goodwill amount. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than the carrying amount of goodwill, then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. T-Mobile tests its spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with the management of the overall business at a national level. T-Mobile estimates the fair value of the licenses using the Greenfield approach, which is an income approach that estimates the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The Greenfield approach values the licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, licenses). The value of the licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. T-Mobile bases the assumptions underlying the Greenfield approach on a combination of market participant data and T-Mobile’s historical results, trends and business plans. Future cash flows in the Greenfield approach are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, EBITDA margin, network build-out period, and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital. If the carrying amount of spectrum licenses exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. The valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the T-Mobile impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. If actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. The most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, EBITDA margins and the long-term growth rate. As a result of an impairment test performed in 2012, T-Mobile recorded an impairment charge on goodwill. As the result of the annual impairment test in 2011, T-Mobile recorded impairment charges on goodwill and spectrum licenses. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 – Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding annual impairment test and impairment charges.Guarantee Liabilities In July 2013, T-Mobile launched JUMP!, a handset upgrade program, that provides eligible customers a specific-price trade-in right to upgrade their handset. Participating customers must finance their handset using our EIP. Upon upgrading, the customer will receive a credit in the amount of their outstanding EIP balance provided they trade in their used handset in good working condition and purchase a new handset from T-Mobile. For customers who enroll in the trade-in program, T-Mobile defers a portion of equipment sales revenue which represents the estimated value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. The guarantee liabilities are valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which requires judgment, including primarily the customer's estimated remaining EIP balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used handset at trade-in, and probability and timing of trade-in. When the customer upgrades their handset, the difference between the trade-in credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned handset is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. All assumptions are reviewed periodically. Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsT-Mobile accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the Company uses a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: Level 1Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;Level 2Inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly, and;Level 3Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require T-Mobile to develop its own assumptions.Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair values. T-Mobile uses discounted cash flow techniques to determine the fair value, which incorporates market-based observable inputs such as interest rates, credit spreads, forward currency exchange rates and estimates and assumptions such as instrument’s term, notional amounts, discount rate and credit risk. T-Mobile’s derivative instruments comprised of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps entered into in connection with long-term debt to affiliates and were classified as Level 2 in the three-tier value hierarchy. Prior to the closing of the business combination with MetroPCS, Deutsche Telekom recapitalized T-Mobile by retiring the existing T-Mobile long-term debt to affiliates and all related derivative instruments, which included the interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps.Rent Expense Most of the leases on T-Mobile’s tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of rent payable over time. T-Mobile calculates straight-line rent expense for each of these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on T-Mobile in such amount that a renewal appears, at lease inception, to be reasonably assured. T-Mobile is therefore required at lease inception to make significant assumptions in determining and assessing the factors that constitute a “penalty”. In doing so, T-Mobile primarily considers costs incurred in acquiring and developing new sites, the useful life of site improvements and equipment costs, future economic conditions and the extent to which improvements in wireless technologies can be incorporated into a current assessment of whether an economic compulsion will exist in the future to renew a lease.Stock-based CompensationStock-based compensation cost for stock awards, which includes restricted stock units (“RSU”) and performance stock units (“PSU”) awards, is measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized as an expense, net of expected forfeitures, over the related service period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of T-Mobile common stock on the date of grant. RSUs are recognized as expense using the straight-line method. PSUs are recognized as expense following a graded vesting schedule. Judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock awards which are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from our expected forfeitures, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted. Income TaxesT-Mobile recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. A valuation allowance is maintained against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. T-Mobile uses judgment to determine the valuation allowance while considering many factors, including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.39Table of ContentsT-Mobile accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. T-Mobile uses judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjusts the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsIn February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2013-02, “Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” The standard requires entities to present information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in a single note or on the face of the financial statements. The standard also requires that entities present either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements, the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. If a component is not required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety, the entity should instead cross reference to the related footnote for additional information. The new guidance became effective for T-Mobile for the year ended December 31, 2013. The implementation of this standard affected our disclosures but did not affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskT-Mobile is exposed to economic risks in the normal course of business, primarily from changes in interest rates. These risks, along with other business risks, impact our cost of capital. Our policy is to manage exposure related to fluctuations in interest rates in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term. We have established interest rate risk limits that are closely monitored by measuring interest rate sensitivities of its debt and interest rate derivatives portfolios. We do not foresee significant changes in the strategies used to manage market risk in the near future. Interest Rate RiskWe are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our long-term debt to affiliates. As of December 31, 2013, we had $5.6 billion in long-term debt with Deutsche Telekom comprised of senior reset notes. Changes in interest rates can lead to significant fluctuations in the fair value of our variable-rate debt instruments. To perform the sensitivity analysis on the long-term debt to affiliates, we assessed the risk of a change in the fair value from the effect of a hypothetical interest rate change of 100 basis points. As of December 31, 2013, the change in the fair value of our long-term debt to affiliates, based on this hypothetical change, is shown in the table below: Fair Value Assuming(in millions)Fair Value +100 Basis Point Shift -100 Basis Point ShiftLong-term debt to affiliates$5,866 $5,791 $5,93740Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:43:54.955972
1283699,TMUS,"T-Mobile US, Inc.",2015,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsExcept as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. OverviewThe MD&A is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the three years ended December 31, 2014 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Business OverviewWe are the Un-carrier. Un-satisfied with the status quo. Un-afraid to innovate. T-Mobile is the fastest growing wireless company in the U.S., based on customer growth in 2014, currently providing wireless communications services, including voice, messaging and data, to over 55 million customers in the postpaid, prepaid, and wholesale markets. The Un-carrier proposition is an approach that seeks to listen to the customer, address their pain points, bring innovation to the industry, and 23Table of Contentsimprove the wireless experience for all. In practice, this means offering customers a great service on a nationwide LTE network, devices when and how they want them, and plans that are simple, affordable and without unnecessary restrictions. Going forward, we will continue to listen and respond to our customers, refine and improve the Un-carrier proposition, and deliver the best value experience in the industry.Our Un-carrier proposition is first and foremost about the customer. In 2014, we continued to aggressively address customer pain points with the launch of the following phases of our Un-carrier proposition:•Contract Freedom – In January 2014, we announced phase 4.0, which reimburses customers’ ETFs when they switch from other carriers and trade in their eligible device. •Test Drive – In June 2014, we released phase 5.0, which allows consumers to test our network and an Apple iPhone 5s with unlimited nationwide service for seven days at no charge. •Music Freedom – In June 2014, we introduced phase 6.0, which allows Simple Choice customers to stream music from popular music services without it counting against their high-speed data allotment. Additionally, we launched Rhapsody unRadio, which is available to our eligible Simple Choice customers at no additional cost or at a discounted price. •Wi-Fi Un-leashed – In September 2014, we launched phase 7.0, which provides Wi-Fi calling and texting for Simple Choice customers on capable smartphones. In addition, we unveiled the T-Mobile Personal CellSpot, a new device which provides customers with greater coverage in their home. Finally, through a new partnership with Gogo, customers with compatible devices can send and receive unlimited text, picture messages and receive visual voicemails on any Gogo-equipped U.S.-based flight for free. •Data Stash – In December 2014, we introduced phase 8.0, giving customers the ability to roll their unused high-speed data automatically each month into a personal Data Stash so they can use it when they need it for up to a year. Starting in January 2015, Data Stash will be automatically available at no extra charge to every T-Mobile customer with a postpaid Simple Choice plan who has purchased additional LTE data, 3GB or more for smartphones and 1 GB or more for tablets. In addition, beginning in January 2015, we will provide a one-time Free Data Stash to start with of 10 GB of LTE data to all qualifying customers, which will expire at the end of 2015.Financial HighlightsOur primary financial focus is on growing Adjusted EBITDA, which we expect to continue to improve in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $5.6 billion in 2014, compared to $4.9 billion in 2013 and 2012. Adjusted EBITDA is primarily driven by increasing revenues. We generate revenues by offering affordable wireless communication services to our postpaid, prepaid and wholesale customers, as well as through sale of a wide selection of wireless devices and accessories. Total revenues increased to $29.6 billion in 2014 compared to $24.4 billion in 2013 and $19.7 billion in 2012. We introduced our Un-carrier proposition in 2013 with the objective of eliminating customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry. We believe Un-carrier phases 1.0 through 8.0 have been successful as evidenced by our strong customer growth momentum since the launch of our Un-carrier proposition. Total net customer additions were 8,334,000 in 2014, a significant improvement compared to 4,377,000 in 2013 and 203,000 in 2012.We generate the majority of our service revenues by providing wireless communication services to branded postpaid customers. Our ability to acquire and retain branded postpaid customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues. Total branded postpaid net customer additions were 4,886,000 in 2014, a significant improvement compared to net customer additions of 2,006,000 in 2013 and net customer losses of 2,074,000 in 2012. In addition, we have continued to focus on retaining customers through churn reduction initiatives to improve customer experience. Branded postpaid phone churn improved to 1.58% in 2014, compared to 1.69% in 2013 and 2.33% in 2012. Improvements in branded postpaid net customer additions and churn were driven by the continued success of our Un-carrier proposition and strong customer response to promotions. We expect further growth in our branded postpaid net customer additions in 2015 as we continue to offer competitive pricing and improve our network and customer experience. We have also increased our service revenues from branded prepaid customers through the business combination with MetroPCS in 2013 and the expansion of the MetroPCS brand in 2014. In addition, we experienced increases in equipment sales from significant growth in the number of devices sold on higher gross customer additions and upgrade volumes, including redemptions through JUMP!. 24Table of ContentsOur most significant expenses are related to acquiring and retaining high-quality customers, compensating employees, and operating and expanding our network. We expect operating expenses will continue to increase to support our strong customer growth. Operating expenses were $28.1 billion in 2014, compared to $23.4 billion in 2013 and $26.1 billion in 2012. Improvements in gross customer additions caused significant growth in the number of devices sold, which resulted in higher cost of equipment sales, and employee-related costs, such as commissions. In addition, employee-related costs increased as a result of increases in the number of retail and customer support employees needed to support customer growth. We also increased promotional activities to attract new customers. We have incurred expenses as part of the network modernization due to increased depreciation expense related to the build out of the LTE network and costs related to decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant cell sites.Liquidity and Capital Resources HighlightsThe success of our Un-carrier proposition and continued modernization of our network has further repositioned T-Mobile to provide customers with an unrivaled customer experience, which requires substantial investment in our business. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and the issuance of common and preferred stock, the sale of certain service receivables related to a factoring arrangement, and financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms. In 2014, we completed an offering of new senior unsecured notes in aggregate principal amounts of $3.0 billion, using a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the notes to redeem senior unsecured notes of $1.0 billion with a higher interest rate, and completed a public offering of 20 million shares of preferred stock for net proceeds of $982 million. See Note 8 – Debt and Note 14 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In addition, in 2014, we entered into a two-year factoring arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis with a current maximum funding limit of $640 million. See Note 4 – Factoring Arrangement of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.We have substantially completed the process of upgrading our network to LTE, which provides our customers with the fastest nationwide LTE services. Our LTE network covered 265 million people as of December 31, 2014, compared to more than 200 million people as of December 31, 2013. This surpassed our year-end goal of covering 250 million people with the fastest nationwide LTE network. We are targeting 300 million people with LTE by the end of 2015. In addition, we are currently in the process of building out our network to utilize our recently acquired 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses. Cash capital expenditures for property and equipment, which are primarily related to our network modernization, were $4.3 billion in 2014 compared to $4.0 billion in 2013 and $2.9 billion in 2012. We expect cash capital expenditures for property and equipment to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion in 2015.We provide mobile communication services using spectrum licenses, consisting of 700 MHz A-Block, AWS and PCS licenses. In 2014, we completed transactions for the acquisition of 700 MHz A-Block, AWS and PCS spectrum licenses, primarily from Verizon, with an aggregate fair value of $4.8 billion, which covers approximately 150 million people, in exchange for cash and the transfer of certain AWS and PCS spectrum. In addition, in 2014, we entered into agreements, which are expected to close in 2015, for the acquisition of 700 MHz A-Block, AWS and PCS spectrum licenses with an estimated aggregate fair value of approximately $0.5 billion, which cover more than 40 million people, for cash and the exchange of certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses, which cover approximately 6 million people. The transactions are subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. Upon closing of these pending transactions, we will own 700 MHz A-Block covering 190 million people in total. In January 2015, the FCC announced T-Mobile was the winning bidder of AWS spectrum licenses covering approximately 97 million people for an aggregate bid price of $1.8 billion. T-Mobile expects to receive the AWS spectrum licenses, subject to regulatory approval, in the second quarter of 2015. These transactions are expected to further enhance our portfolio of U.S. nationwide broadband spectrum. See Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Intangible Assets and Note 16 – Subsequent Events of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In 2015, we will seek to opportunistically acquire additional spectrum in private party transactions to further enhance our portfolio of U.S. nationwide broadband spectrum and enable the expansion of LTE coverage to new markets.See “Results of Operations” below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and “Performance Measures” for a description of performance measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA and churn. The comparability of results in this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 is affected by the inclusion of MetroPCS results after the completion of the business combination on April 30, 2013.25Table of ContentsResults of OperationsSet forth below is a summary of consolidated results: Year Ended December 31, PercentageChange 2014Versus 2013 PercentageChange 2013Versus 2012(in millions)2014 2013 2012 Revenues Branded postpaid revenues$14,392 $13,166 $14,521 9 % (9)%Branded prepaid revenues6,986 4,945 1,715 41 % NMWholesale revenues731 613 544 19 % 13 %Roaming and other service revenues266 344 433 (23)% (21)%Total service revenues22,375 19,068 17,213 17 % 11 %Equipment sales6,789 5,033 2,242 35 % 124 %Other revenues400 319 264 25 % 21 %Total revenues29,564 24,420 19,719 21 % 24 %Operating expenses Cost of services, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below5,788 5,279 4,661 10 % 13 %Cost of equipment sales9,621 6,976 3,437 38 % 103 %Selling, general and administrative8,863 7,382 6,796 20 % 9 %Depreciation and amortization4,412 3,627 3,187 22 % 14 %Cost of MetroPCS business combination299 108 7 NM NMImpairment charges— — 8,134 NM NMGains on disposal of spectrum licenses(840) (2) (205) NM (99)%Other, net5 54 99 (91)% (45)%Total operating expenses28,148 23,424 26,116 20 % (10)%Operating income (loss)1,416 996 (6,397) 42 % NMOther income (expense) Interest expense to affiliates(278) (678) (661) (59)% 3 %Interest expense(1,073) (545) — 97 % NMInterest income359 189 77 90 % NMOther income (expense), net(11) 89 (5) NM NMTotal other expense, net(1,003) (945) (589) 6 % 60 %Income (loss) before income taxes413 51 (6,986) NM NMIncome tax expense166 16 350 NM (95)%Net income (loss)$247 $35 $(7,336) NM NMNM – Not MeaningfulYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013RevenuesBranded postpaid revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 9%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of average branded postpaid customers driven by the continued success of our Un-carrier proposition and strong customer response to promotions for services and devices. Additional increases resulted from customer adoption of upgrade and insurance programs and changes in requalification requirements for corporate discount programs. The increase was partially offset by lower branded postpaid average revenue per account (“ARPA”). See “Performance Measures” for a description of ARPA. Branded postpaid ARPA was negatively impacted by continued growth of our Simple Choice plans, which have lower monthly service charges compared to traditional bundled plans. Branded postpaid customers on Simple Choice plans increased over the past twelve months to 89% of the branded postpaid customer base as of December 31, 2014, compared to 69% as of December 31, 2013. Branded prepaid revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 41% in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily driven by growth of the customer base from the expansion of the MetroPCS brand and an increase in promotional activities. In addition, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period following the business combination in April 2013 contributed to the increase. 26Table of ContentsWholesale revenues increased $118 million, or 19%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in customer programs and monthly plans, including data, offered by our MVNO partners and changes to our MVNO contractual arrangements. Roaming and other service revenues decreased $78 million, or 23%, in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to a decline in ETFs following our introduction of the no annual service contract feature of the Simple Choice plan launched in March 2013. Equipment sales increased $1.8 billion, or 35%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the number of devices sold due to higher gross customer additions and higher device upgrade volumes, including JUMP! redemptions. The volume of device sales increased 48% in 2014, compared to 2013. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013 contributed to the increase. The increase was partially offset by reimbursements of other carriers’ ETFs and a lower average revenue per device sold.We financed $5.8 billion of equipment sales revenues through EIP during 2014, an increase from $3.3 billion in 2013, resulting from growth of our Simple Choice plans. Additionally, customers had associated EIP billings of $3.6 billion in 2014, compared to $1.5 billion in 2013. Other revenues increased $81 million, or 25%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher co-location rental income from leasing space on wireless communication towers to third parties and higher lease income associated with spectrum license lease agreements resulting from spectrum swap transactions.Operating ExpensesCost of services increased $509 million, or 10%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013. Additionally, higher lease expense primarily relating to spectrum license lease agreements resulting from spectrum swap transactions contributed to the increase. Cost of equipment sales increased $2.6 billion, or 38%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the number of devices sold due to higher gross customer additions and higher device upgrade volumes, including JUMP! redemptions. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013 contributed to the increase. The volume of device sales increased 48% in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was partially offset by a lower average cost per device sold. Selling, general and administrative increased $1.5 billion, or 20%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs as a result of increases in the number of retail and customer support employees, higher commissions driven by increased gross customer additions and higher promotional costs. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013 and higher stock-based compensation contributed to the increase. Depreciation and amortization increased $785 million, or 22%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily associated with the build-out of the T-Mobile LTE network, which increased the depreciable asset base. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013, including accelerated depreciation related to the decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network, contributed to the increase. Cost of MetroPCS business combination of $299 million in 2014 primarily reflects network decommissioning costs associated with the business combination. In 2014, we began decommissioning the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant network cell sites. Network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. We intend to decommission certain cell sites and incur additional network decommissioning costs in the range of $500 million to $600 million, a majority of which are expected to be recognized in 2015. See Note 2 – Business Combination with MetroPCS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information. Cost of MetroPCS business combination of $108 million in 2013 reflects personnel-related costs and professional services costs associated with the business combination.Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $840 million in 2014 primarily consisted of non-cash gains from spectrum license transactions with Verizon, and to a lesser extent, a non-cash gain from a spectrum license transaction with AT&T during the 27Table of Contentsfourth quarter of 2014. See Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.Other, net decreased $49 million, or 91%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to our 2013 restructuring program to align our operations to our new strategy and position the company for future growth. Costs associated with the 2013 restructuring program primarily consisted of severance and other personnel-related costs. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense to affiliates decreased $400 million, or 59%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower debt balances with Deutsche Telekom in 2014, resulting from the recapitalization of T-Mobile prior to the business combination in April 2013 and Deutsche Telekom’s sale of non-reset notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.6 billion in October 2013. To a lesser extent, additional decreases resulted from fair value adjustments related to embedded derivative instruments associated with the senior reset notes issued to Deutsche Telekom in the recapitalization. Interest expense increased $528 million, or 97% in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily the result of higher debt balances in 2014 compared to 2013, including senior notes issued in 2013, the assumption of MetroPCS long-term debt in connection with the business combination in April 2013, the reclassification of non-reset notes from long-term debt to affiliates to long-term debt following Deutsche Telekom’s sale of the non-reset notes in October 2013, and to a lesser extent, the issuance of new senior unsecured notes in September 2014. Interest income increased $170 million, or 90% in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was the result of significant growth in devices financed through EIP. Interest associated with EIP receivables is imputed at the time of sale and then recognized over the financed installment term. Other income (expense), net decreased $100 million in 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the recognition of foreign currency translation gains in 2013 related to the retirement of derivative instruments prior to the business combination in April 2013. This decrease was offset in part by a non-cash gain recognized in 2014 on the extinguishment of $1.0 billion of 7.875% senior notes due in 2018. Income TaxesIncome tax expense increased $150 million in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax income. The effective tax rate was 40.2% in 2014, compared to 31.4% in 2013. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance on certain state income tax attributes, which was partially offset by an increase in federal tax credits and a reduction in the effect of Puerto Rico taxes on the effective tax rate. Guarantor SubsidiariesPursuant to the indenture and the supplemental indentures, the long-term debt, excluding capital leases, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile US, Inc. (“Parent”) and certain of T-Mobile USA’s (“Issuer”) 100% owned subsidiaries (“Guarantor Subsidiaries”). In 2014, T-Mobile entered into a two-year factoring arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis. In connection with the factoring arrangement, the Company formed the Factoring SPE, which is included in the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries condensed consolidating financial information. The financial condition of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries is substantially similar to the Company’s consolidated financial condition. Similarly, the results of operations of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries are substantially similar to the Company’s consolidated results of operations. As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the most significant components of the financial condition of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries were property and equipment of $537 million and $595 million, respectively, long-term financial obligations of $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, and stockholders’ deficit of $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The most significant components of the results of operations of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries in 2014 were services revenues of $1.3 billion, offset by costs of equipment sales of $702 million resulting in a net comprehensive loss of $38 million. Similarly, for 2013, services revenues of $823 million were offset by costs of equipment sales of $552 million, resulting in a net comprehensive loss of $52 million. 28Table of ContentsYear Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012RevenuesBranded postpaid revenues decreased $1.4 billion, or 9%, in 2013, compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower ARPA. Branded postpaid ARPA was negatively impacted by the growth of our Simple Choice plans which have lower priced rate plans than other branded postpaid rate plans. Compared to other traditional bundled postpaid price plans, Simple Choice plans result in lower service revenues but higher equipment sales at the time of the purchase as the plans do not include a bundled sale of a discounted device. Branded postpaid customers on Simple Choice plans more than doubled over the past twelve months to 69% of the branded postpaid customer base at December 31, 2013, compared to 30% at December 31, 2012.Branded prepaid revenues increased $3.2 billion in 2013, compared to 2012. Of the increase, approximately $2.9 billion was due to the inclusion of MetroPCS’s operating results following the business combination in April 2013. Excluding MetroPCS operating results, the increase in 2013 resulted primarily from an increase in average branded prepaid customers driven by the success of T-Mobile’s monthly prepaid service plans, including data services that also have higher ARPU.Wholesale revenues increased $69 million, or 13%, in 2013, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to growth of the average number of MVNO customers for the period. The increase in MVNO customers was due in part to growth of government subsidized Lifeline programs offered by our MVNO partners along with MVNO partnerships launched in the fourth quarter of 2012. However, a significant portion of our MVNO partners’ recent customer growth has been in lower ARPU products that result in revenues that do not increase in proportion with customer growth.Roaming and other service revenues decreased $89 million, or 21%, in 2013, compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower early termination fees of $58 million due to the no annual service contract features of Simple Choice plans launched in March 2013. Additionally, international voice and domestic data revenues decreased due to rate reductions negotiated with certain roaming partners.Equipment sales increased $2.8 billion, or 124%, in 2013, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the number of devices sold and an increase in the rate of customers upgrading their device. Additionally, equipment sales increased due to growth in the sales of smartphones, which have higher average revenue per device sold as compared to other devices. This was driven by our introduction of both the Apple iPhone 5 and the Samsung Galaxy S®4 in the second quarter of 2013, and the Apple iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c in the third quarter of 2013. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS’s operating results following the business combination in April 2013 contributed approximately $450 million to the increase in equipment sales in 2013.We financed $3.3 billion of equipment sales revenues through equipment installment plans in 2013, a significant increase from $946 million in 2012 resulting from growth in Simple Choice plans. Additionally, customers had associated equipment installment plan billings of $1.5 billion in 2013, compared to $450 million in 2012.Other revenues increased $55 million, or 21%, in 2013, compared to 2012 due primarily to an increase in imputed rental income on wireless communication tower sites.Operating ExpensesCost of services increased $618 million, or 13%, in 2013, compared to 2012. Of the increase, approximately $800 million was due to the inclusion of the operating results of MetroPCS following the business combination in April 2013. Cost of services, excluding MetroPCS, decreased due to lower roaming expenses of $126 million related to reduced roaming rates negotiated with certain roaming partners. Additionally, due to the network transition to enhanced telecommunication lines with higher capacity, we were able to accommodate higher data volumes at a lower cost.Cost of equipment sales increased $3.5 billion, or 103%, in 2013, compared to 2012. The increase in cost of equipment sales was primarily attributable to a 67% increase in the volume of devices sold during 2013. The increase was partially attributable to higher average cost per device sold due in part to a 90% increase in the sale of smartphones units in 2013, compared to 2012. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS’s operating results following the business combination in April 2013 contributed approximately $950 million to the increase in cost of equipment sales in 2013.Selling, general and administrative increased $586 million, or 9%, in 2013, compared to 2012. Of the increase, approximately $650 million was attributable to the inclusion of operating results of MetroPCS following the business 29Table of Contentscombination in April 2013. Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding MetroPCS, decreased $61 million, or 1%, primarily driven by $241 million in lower bad debt expense, net of recoveries, as a result of improved credit quality of our customer portfolio. This decrease was partially offset by higher commission expenses driven by increased gross customer additions in 2013.Depreciation and amortization increased $440 million, or 14%, in 2013, compared to 2012. Depreciation and amortization attributable to MetroPCS following the business combination in April 2013 was approximately $550 million. Depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding MetroPCS, decreased in 2013 as 2012 included increased depreciation expense due to the shortening of useful lives of certain network equipment to be replaced in connection with network modernization efforts.Cost of MetroPCS business combination increased $101 million in 2013, compared to 2012 due primarily to personnel related costs associated with the change in control, professional services costs and network integration expenses associated with the business combination between T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS. See also Note 2 – Business Combination with MetroPCS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Gain on disposal of spectrum licenses of $205 million in 2012 primarily consisted of non-cash gains related to an AWS spectrum license exchange with Verizon. Other, net of $54 million in 2013 relates primarily to our 2013 cost restructuring program to align our operations to our new strategy and position the company for future growth. Costs associated with the 2013 restructuring program primarily consist of severance and other personnel-related costs. Other, net of $99 million in 2012 related primarily to the consolidation of our call center operations in 2012.Other Income (Expense) Interest expense to affiliates increased $17 million, or 3%, in 2013, compared to 2012. Prior to the closing of the business combination with MetroPCS, Deutsche Telekom recapitalized T-Mobile USA by retiring its long-term debt to affiliates of $14.5 billion and all related derivative instruments, in exchange for new senior unsecured notes of $11.2 billion. Later in 2013, Deutsche Telekom sold the senior non-reset notes resulting in an aggregate principal reduction of $5.6 billion in long-term debt to affiliates. The increase in interest expense to affiliates was primarily due to losses related to the retirement of derivative instruments associated with the extinguishment of the long-term debt to affiliates prior to the business combination, and higher average interest rates on the new senior unsecured notes. See also Note 8 – Debt and Note 14 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Interest expense increased $545 million in 2013, compared to 2012. The increase in interest expense is primarily the result of MetroPCS long-term debt assumed during the second quarter of 2013 in connection with the business combination, as well as new senior notes issued during 2013. Additionally, interest expense of approximately $200 million in 2013 related to the long-term financial obligation resulting from the Tower Transaction that closed on November 30, 2012. The Tower Transaction and related impacts are further described in Note 9 – Tower Transaction and Related Long-Term Financial Obligation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Interest income increased $112 million in 2013, compared to 2012. The increase in interest income is the result of the significant growth in handsets financed through our equipment installment plans in 2013. Imputed interest associated with our EIP receivables is imputed at the time of sale and then recognized over the financed installment term.Other income (expense), net increased $94 million in 2013, compared to 2012. The increase in other income (expense), net was primarily due to the recognition of gains related to the retirement of derivative instruments associated with the pre-business combination long-term debt to affiliates. See also Note 8 – Debt and Note 14 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Income TaxesIncome tax expense decreased $334 million in 2013, compared to 2012. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to lower pre-tax income, exclusive of impairment charges. The effective tax rate was 31.4% and (5.0)% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to the impact of the goodwill impairment recorded in 2012.30Table of ContentsGuarantor SubsidiariesIn 2013, T-Mobile entered into an agreement with Cook Inlet Voice and Data Services, Inc. (“Cook Inlet”) to acquire all of Cook Inlet's interest in Cook Inlet/VoiceStream GSM VII PCS Holdings LLC, (“CIVS VII”), a fully consolidated Non-Guarantor Subsidiary. The transaction was completed in July 2013 and resulted in CIVS VII becoming an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of T-Mobile USA. CIVS VII was subsequently combined with, and the net assets transferred to, T-Mobile License LLC, a wholly-owned Restricted Subsidiary of T-Mobile USA.The financial condition of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries is substantially similar to the Company’s consolidated financial condition. Similarly, the results of operations of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries are substantially similar to the Company’s consolidated results of operations. The change in the financial condition of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries was primarily due to the transfer of the net assets of CIVS VII into the Guarantor Subsidiaries consolidating balance sheet information as described above. As of December 31, 2013, the most significant components of the financial condition of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries were property and equipment of $595 million, long-term financial obligations of $2.1 billion, and stockholders’ deficit of $1.3 billion. The most significant components of the results of operations of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries in 2012, were services revenues of $712 million were offset by costs of equipment sales of $449 million, resulting in a net comprehensive income of $72 million. Performance MeasuresIn managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by the financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures. These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate key operating performance comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry.Total CustomersA customer is generally defined as a SIM card with a unique T-Mobile identity number which is associated with an account that generates revenue. Branded customers generally include customers that are qualified either for postpaid service, where they generally pay after incurring service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance. Wholesale customers include M2M and MVNO customers that operate on our network, but are managed by wholesale partners.

At December 31, 2014, we had 55.0 million customers, an 18% increase from the customer total as of December 31, 2013, as a result of growth in all customer categories, as described below.Net customer additions, excluding customers acquired as a result of the MetroPCS business combination were 4,377,000 in 2013, compared to 203,000 net customer additions in 2012. At December 31, 2013, we had 46.7 million customers, a 40% increase from the customer total as of December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of MetroPCS’s customer base due to the completion of the business combination during the second quarter of 2013, which increased the branded prepaid customer base by 8,918,000. Branded CustomersBranded postpaid phone net customer additions were 4,047,000 in 2014, compared to branded postpaid phone net customer additions of 1,938,000 in 2013. The increase in customer development was attributable to increased new customer activations and improved branded postpaid phone churn driven by the continued success of our Un-carrier proposition and strong customer response to promotions for services and devices. Additional increases in customer development resulted from the launch of new popular devices.Branded postpaid phone net customer additions were 1,938,000 in 2013, compared to branded postpaid phone net customer losses of 2,092,000 in 2012. The significant improvement in customer development was primarily attributable to improved branded postpaid phone churn, increased new customer activations and qualified upgrades of branded prepaid customers to branded postpaid plans. Branded postpaid phone net customer additions benefited from the launch of Simple Choice plans as a component of the Un-carrier proposition and launch of popular devices in 2013. These factors drove incremental gross additions for branded postpaid phone customers and improved churn as further described below. Branded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions were 839,000 in 2014, compared to branded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions of 68,000 in 2013. The significant increase was driven by strong customer response to promotions for mobile broadband services and devices. Branded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions were 68,000 in 2013, compared to branded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions of 18,000 in 2012. The increase was driven by the positive customer response to the “Tablets Un-leashed” promotion launched in October 2013.Branded prepaid net customer additions were 1,244,000 in 2014, compared to branded prepaid net customer additions of 328,000 in 2013. The increase in customer development was attributable to higher branded prepaid gross customer additions due to the growth and expansion of the MetroPCS brand, including the launch into additional markets following the MetroPCS business combination in April 2013. This increase was offset in part by higher deactivations from the competitive environment in the prepaid market.Branded prepaid net customer additions, excluding customers of MetroPCS acquired as a result of the business combination, were 328,000 in 2013, compared to 1,007,000 branded prepaid net customer additions in 2012. The decrease was partly a result of qualified upgrades of branded prepaid customers to branded postpaid plans as the Un-carrier proposition eliminates 32Table of Contentsannual service contracts to credit worthy customers that have historically been utilizing prepaid products. In addition, the robust competitive environment in the prepaid market resulted in higher branded prepaid customer deactivations, partially offset by higher branded prepaid gross customer additions due in part to the expansion of the MetroPCS brand, including the launch into 30 additional markets since the completion of the business combination.WholesaleWholesale net customer additions were 2,204,000 in 2014, compared to wholesale net customer additions of 2,043,000 in 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to higher M2M gross customer additions resulting from strong activation volume, partially offset by a decrease in MVNO net customer additions driven by higher churn. T-Mobile offers its M2M customers innovative products and solutions to assist them in embracing the Internet of Things (“IoT”). MVNO customers continued to grow, although at a slower rate in 2014 than 2013. MVNO partners often have relationships with multiple carriers and through steering their business towards carriers offering promotions, can impact specific carriers’ results.Wholesale net customer additions were 2,043,000 in 2013, compared to wholesale net customer additions of 1,270,000 in 2012. The growth in MVNO customers was due in part to government subsidized Lifeline programs offered by our MVNO partners along with ongoing growth from MVNO partnerships launched in the fourth quarter of 2012. Customers Per AccountCustomers per account is calculated by dividing the number of branded postpaid customers as of the end of the period by the number of branded postpaid accounts as of the end of the period. An account may include branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers. We believe branded postpaid customers per account provides management with useful information to evaluate our branded postpaid customer base on a per account basis. Year Ended December 31,2014 2013 2012Branded postpaid customers per account2.36 2.18 2.17Branded postpaid customers per account were 2.36 as of December 31, 2014, compared to 2.18 as of December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average number of branded postpaid phone customers per account resulting from promotions for services, including the “4 for $100” offer, and increased penetration of mobile broadband devices.Branded postpaid customers per account as of December 31, 2013 was consistent compared to December 31, 2012. ChurnChurn represents the number of customers whose service was discontinued as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period. The number of customers whose service was discontinued is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored. We believe that churn provides management with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.

The year over year improvement in branded postpaid phone churn was impacted by the continued success of our Un-carrier initiatives resulting in increased customer loyalty.Branded postpaid phone churn was 1.69% for the year ended December 31, 2013, a 64 basis point improvement compared to 2.33% in 2012. The significant improvements were due in part to the continued focus on churn reduction initiatives, such as improving network quality and the customer sales experience. Additionally, our no annual service contracts announced in the first quarter of 2013 gained positive traction with customers. We also began offering new handsets in 2013, such as Apple iPhone products and the Samsung Galaxy S4, which improved customer retention compared to the same periods in 2012. 33Table of ContentsBranded prepaid churn was 4.76% for the year ended December 31, 2014, a 61 basis point improvement compared to 5.37% in 2013. The improvement was primarily due to the inclusion and growth of MetroPCS customers, which represent the largest portion of the branded prepaid customer base and historically have lower rates of churn than T-Mobile branded prepaid customers. Branded prepaid churn was 5.37% for the year ended December 31, 2013, a 107 basis point improvement compared to 6.44% in 2012. The improvement was primarily a result of the completion of the business combination with MetroPCS during the second quarter of 2013. MetroPCS customers are now the largest portion of the branded prepaid customer base and have historically had lower rates of churn than the historical T-Mobile branded prepaid business. Consequently, branded prepaid churn was impacted positively by the inclusion of MetroPCS customers.Average Revenue Per Account, Average Billings Per Account, Average Revenue Per User, and Average Billings Per UserAverage Revenue Per Account (“ARPA”) represents the average monthly branded postpaid service revenue earned per account. An account may include branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers. We believe branded postpaid ARPA provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our branded postpaid service revenue realization and assist in forecasting our future branded postpaid service revenues on a per account basis. We consider branded postpaid ARPA to be indicative of our revenue growth potential given the increase in the average number of branded postpaid phone customers per account and increased penetration of mobile broadband devices.Average Billings Per Account (“ABPA”) represents the average monthly branded postpaid customer billings per account. We believe branded postpaid ABPA provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate average branded postpaid customer billings per account as it is indicative of estimated cash collections, including equipment installments payments, from our customers each month on a per account basis.Average Revenue Per User (“ARPU”) represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. Branded postpaid phone ARPU excludes mobile broadband customers and related revenues. We believe branded postpaid phone ARPU and branded postpaid ARPA are useful metrics when assessing the realization of branded postpaid service revenues.We believe branded prepaid ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our branded prepaid service revenue realization and assist in forecasting our future branded prepaid service revenues on a per customer basis.

Branded prepaid ARPU increased $7.74 or 29% for 2013, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of MetroPCS customer base, which generate higher ARPU than the rest of T-Mobile’s branded prepaid customers, as well as the growth of monthly prepaid service plans, which include data services and have higher ARPU than other pay-as-you-go prepaid plans. 35Table of ContentsAdjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest expense (net of interest income), tax, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and expenses not reflective of T-Mobile’s ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a metric to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure our ability to provide cash flows to meet future debt services, capital expenditures and working capital requirements, and fund future growth. We believe analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income, or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.The following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss)which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA: Year Ended December 31,(in millions)2014 2013 2012Net income (loss)$247 $35 $(7,336)Adjustments: Interest expense to affiliates278 678 661Interest expense 1,073 545 —Interest income(359) (189) (77)Other expense (income), net11 (89) 5Income tax expense166 16 350Operating income (loss)1,416 996 (6,397)Depreciation and amortization4,412 3,627 3,187Cost of MetroPCS business combination299 108 7Stock based compensation (1)211 100 —Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses (1)(720) — (156)Impairment charges— — 8,134Other, net (1)18 54 111Adjusted EBITDA$5,636 $4,885 $4,886Adjusted EBITDA margin25% 26% 28%(1)Stock-based compensation includes tax impacts and may not agree to stock based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements. Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses and Other, net transactions may not agree in total to the Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses and Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) primarily due to certain routine operating activities, such as insignificant or routine spectrum license exchanges that would be expected to reoccur, and are therefore included in Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased 15% for 2014, compared to 2013. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by increased branded postpaid revenues resulting from the continued success of our Un-carrier value proposition and strong customer response to promotional activities, as well as the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results since the business combination in 2013, including branded prepaid revenue growth from expansion of the MetroPCS brand. These increases were partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and losses on equipment sales.Adjusted EBITDA was consistent for 2013, compared to 2012. The inclusion of MetroPCS’s operating results since May 1, 2013, contributed approximately $1.0 billion in Adjusted EBITDA for 2013. Excluding the Adjusted EBITDA contributed by MetroPCS’s operating results, Adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by the reduction in service revenues, which declined primarily due to impacts from customers migrating to Simple Choice plans, which result in lower ARPU. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by increases in cost of equipment sales from higher sales volumes, partially offset by increases in equipment sales. Increases in costs of equipment sales and equipment sales were driven by higher gross customer additions and the launch of new handsets in 2013. In addition, equipment sales increased in 2013 due to a higher proportion of customers choosing Simple Choice plans for which we do not include a bundled sale of a discounted device. 36Table of ContentsAdjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2015 is expected to be significantly impacted by a large investment to front end customer growth in 2015, similar to what we did in 2014. In addition, the first quarter of 2015 will reflect the accounting treatment of Un-carrier 8.0 - Data Stash, which is expected to have a non-cash impact in the range of $100 million to $150 million. The accounting treatment of the initial 10 GB allotment, which is a revenue deferral, is expected to fully reverse itself during 2015.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and issuance of common and preferred stock, the sale of certain service receivables related to a factoring arrangement, and financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms. In addition, we have entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom that allows for up to $500 million in borrowings. As of December 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents were $5.3 billion. We expect our current sources of funding to be sufficient to meet the anticipated liquidity requirements of the Company in the next 12 months and intend to use our current sources of funding for general corporate purposes, including capital investments, enhancing our financial flexibility and opportunistically acquiring additional spectrum in private party transactions. We determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment. We may seek to raise additional debt or equity capital to the extent our projections regarding our liquidity requirements change or on an opportunistic basis when there are favorable market conditions. Further, we may consider entering into factoring arrangements to sell certain EIP receivables as an additional source of liquidity.Prior to the completion of the business combination with MetroPCS in April 2013, our sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with Deutsche Telekom included in accounts receivable from affiliates, and cash generated from operations.As of December 31, 2014, our total capital consisted of total debt of $22.0 billion, excluding our long-term financial obligation related to the tower transaction, and stockholders’ equity of $15.7 billion. In 2014, we completed an offering of new senior unsecured notes in aggregate principal amounts of $3.0 billion and used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the notes to redeem senior unsecured notes of $1.0 billion with a higher interest rate. In addition, in 2014, we completed a public offering of 20 million shares of preferred stock for net proceeds of $982 million. Unless converted earlier, each share of the preferred stock will automatically convert in 2017 into between 1.6119 and 1.9342 shares of common stock depending on the applicable market value of the common stock. See Note 8 – Debt and Note 14 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.In 2014, we completed transactions for the acquisition of 700 MHz A-Block, AWS and PCS spectrum licenses, primarily with Verizon, for cash and the transfer of certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. Upon closing of the transactions in 2014, we paid $2.5 billion with cash on hand and transferred certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. In addition, in 2014, the FCC began conducting an auction of AWS spectrum licenses and T-Mobile provided the FCC with a deposit of $417 million in connection with the auction. In January 2015, the FCC announced T-Mobile was the winning bidder of AWS spectrum licenses covering approximately 97 million people for an aggregate bid price of $1.8 billion. T-Mobile will pay the FCC the remaining $1.4 billion for the AWS spectrum licenses in March 2015 with cash on hand. T-Mobile expects to receive the AWS spectrum licenses, subject to regulatory approval, in the second quarter of 2015.In 2014, we entered into a two-year factoring arrangement to sell certain receivables on a revolving basis as an additional source of liquidity. The factoring arrangement has a current maximum funding limit of $640 million, subject to change upon notification to certain third parties. We sold receivables related to the factoring arrangement for net cash proceeds of $610 million in 2014. See Note 4 – Factoring Arrangement of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.The indentures governing the long-term debt, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the indentures and the supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt restrict the ability of the Issuer to loan funds or make payments to the Parent. However, the Issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the 37Table of ContentsParent under the terms of each of the indentures and the supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of December 31, 2014.Capital ExpendituresOur liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure.The property and equipment capital expenditures in 2014 and 2013 primarily relate to our network modernization and deployment of LTE. The capital expenditures in 2012 were primarily associated with the continued expansion of our network coverage. During 2012, we were developing plans to deploy LTE in 2013 after the terminated AT&T transaction. As such, capital spending was lower in 2012 than in subsequent periods.We expect cash capital expenditures for property and equipment to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion in 2015. This does not include purchases of spectrum licenses.Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes the consolidated statements of cash flows: Year Ended December 31,(in millions)2014 2013 2012Net cash provided by operating activities$4,146 $3,545 $3,862Net cash used in investing activities(7,246) (2,092) (3,915)Net cash provided by financing activities2,524 4,044 57The historical cash flows of T-Mobile USA should not be considered representative of the anticipated cash flows of T-Mobile US, Inc., the combined company resulting from the business combination.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion in 2014, compared to $3.5 billion in 2013. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities was driven by several factors. Our operating income, exclusive of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization and gains from spectrum license transactions, increased slightly compared to the prior year. This was primarily a result of increases in branded postpaid revenues due to our acceleration of customer growth partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs and losses on equipment sales. Net changes in working capital increased slightly. This was primarily a result of increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of vendor payments and proceeds from the sales of certain service receivables related to the factoring arrangement. The increases in working capital were mostly offset by increases in EIP receivables as the result of significant growth in devices financed through EIP and increases in inventories.Cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion in 2013, compared to $3.9 billion in 2012. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities was driven by several factors. Our operating income, exclusive of non-cash items such as impairment charges and depreciation and amortization, declined compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of decreases in branded postpaid revenues. Net changes in working capital decreased slightly due to increases in EIP receivables, offset in part by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due in part to timing of vendor payments. Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities was $7.2 billion in 2014, compared to $2.1 billion used in 2013. In 2014, cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of purchases of property and equipment of $4.3 billion as a result of our network modernization and purchases of intangible assets of $2.9 billion due primarily to the acquisition of 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses. In 2013, cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of purchases of property and equipment of $4.0 billion as a result of our network modernization. This was partially offset by cash and cash equivalents acquired in connection with the business combination with MetroPCS of $2.1 billion and the settlement of a short-term loan receivable, net with Deutsche Telekom of $300 million. 38Table of ContentsCash used in investing activities was $2.1 billion in 2013, compared to $3.9 billion used in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to the cash and cash equivalents acquired in connection with the business combination with MetroPCS of $2.1 billion. The decrease was partially offset by $1.1 billion higher purchases of property and equipment in 2013, as compared to 2012, as a result of T-Mobile’s network modernization in 2013 described above.Financing ActivitiesCash provided by financing activities was $2.5 billion in 2014, compared to $4.0 billion in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to higher repayments of long-term debt of $1.0 billion, lower net proceeds from the issuance of stock of $805 million, higher net repayments of short-term debt of $174 million and lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $110 million. The decrease was partially offset by higher net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $499 million.Cash provided by financing activities was $4.0 billion in 2013, compared to $57 million in 2012. The increase was primarily due to net proceeds of $2.5 billion from the issuance of long-term debt, net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $1.8 billion, and proceeds from the exercises of stock options issued of $137 million. The increase was offset by repayments of short-term debt for purchases of property and equipment of $244 million, the purchase of Cook Inlet's interest in CIVS VII of $80 million, and a distribution to Deutsche Telekom of $41 million in connection with the recapitalization of T-Mobile USA effected immediately prior to the completion of the business combination with MetroPCS.Contractual ObligationsCurrent accounting standards require disclosure of material obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as debt, lease agreements, and purchase obligations. See Note 8 – Debt and Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.The following table provides aggregate information about T-Mobile’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014:(in millions)Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years More Than 5 Years TotalLong-term debt (1)$— $— $3,000 $18,200 $21,200Interest on long-term debt1,320 2,644 2,563 3,000 9,527Capital lease obligations, including interest49 102 107 319 577Vendor financing arrangements64 — — — 64Financial obligation (2)166 332 332 1,316 2,146Operating leases, including dedicated transportation lines2,289 4,073 3,420 5,520 15,302Non-dedicated transportation lines715 1,389 945 935 3,984Purchase obligations (3)1,496 2,898 20 — 4,414Network decommissioning (4)80 85 57 63 285Total contractual obligations$6,099 $11,438 $10,387 $29,290 $57,214(1)Represents principal amounts of long-term debt at maturity, excluding unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment, capital lease obligations and vendor financing arrangements. (2)Future minimum payments, including principal and interest payments and imputed lease rental income, related to the long-term financial obligation recorded in connection with the Tower Transaction. See Note 9 – Tower Transaction and Related Long-Term Financial Obligation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.(3)T-Mobile calculated the minimum obligation for certain agreements to purchase goods or services based on termination fees that can be paid to exit the contract. Termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due in less than one year, as this is the earliest T-Mobile could exit these contracts. For certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. This table does not include open purchase orders as of December 31, 2014 under normal business purposes.(4)Represents future undiscounted cash flows related to decommissioned MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant cell sites as of December 31, 2014. See Note 2 – Business Combination with MetroPCS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. Other long-term liabilities, excluding network decommissioning, have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor of such payments. In addition, dividends on preferred stock have been excluded from the table above as no dividends were declared for the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 14 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.39Table of ContentsThe purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase handsets and accessories, equipment, software, programming and network services, and marketing activities, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent T-Mobile’s entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which T-Mobile is contractually committed. The Company also has purchase obligations that vary with the level of the Company’s sales of certain products. The future development of sales of those products could result in purchase obligations in excess of the amounts shown in the table above. Where T-Mobile is committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether it takes delivery, T-Mobile has included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. Additionally, included within purchase obligations are amounts for the acquisition of spectrum licenses, which are subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In 2014, T-Mobile entered into a two-year factoring arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as an additional source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2014, T-Mobile derecognized net receivables of $768 million upon 40Table of Contentssale through the factoring arrangement. See Note 4 – Factoring Arrangement of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Related Party TransactionsSee Note 14 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding related party transactions.Disclosure of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law. As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates in 2014 that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with Deutsche Telekom. We have relied upon Deutsche Telekom for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.Deutsche Telekom, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: Gostaresh Ertebatat Taliya, Irancell Telecommunications Services Company (“MTN Irancell”), Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran. In 2014, gross revenues of all Deutsche Telekom affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic with Iran were less than $2 million and estimated net profits were less than $2 million. In addition, Deutsche Telekom, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, operating a fixed line network in their respective European home countries (in particular Germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the Embassy of Iran in those European countries. Gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities in 2014 were less than $0.4 million. We understand that Deutsche Telekom intends to continue these activities. 41Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesPreparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results as they require the use of estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Critical accounting policies, which we discuss further below, are those which are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters which are inherently uncertain. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.AllowancesWe maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of customers to make required payments. When determining the allowance, we consider the probability of recovery based on past experience taking into account current collection trends and general economic factors. Collection risks are assessed for each type of receivable, including EIP receivables, based upon historical and expected write-offs, net of recoveries, and an analysis of the aged accounts receivable balances with reserves generally increasing as the receivable ages. To the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends or assumptions, the required allowance amounts could differ from the estimate. We write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and future collection is unlikely, based on customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date.We offer certain retail customers the option to pay for devices and other accessories in installments using an EIP. At the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest as there is no stated rate of interest on the EIP receivables and record the EIP receivables at their present value, which is determined by discounting all expected future payments at the imputed interest rate. The difference between the present value of the EIP receivables and their face amount results in a discount which is recorded as a direct reduction to the carrying value with a corresponding reduction to equipment sales. We determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rates and the amount of expected credit losses on the EIP receivables. As a result, we do not recognize a separate valuation allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable. The current portion of the EIP receivables is included in equipment installment plan receivables, net and the long-term portion of the EIP receivables is included in equipment installment plan receivables due after one year, net. The imputed discount on EIP receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the interest method and recognized as interest income in other income (expenses), net.Subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we assess the need for and, if necessary, recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the expected credit losses on the gross EIP receivables exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances. The allowance is based on a number of factors, including collection experience, aging of the accounts receivable portfolio, credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions. Total imputed discount and allowances as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was approximately 7.4% and 8.6%, respectively, of the total amount of gross accounts receivable, including EIP receivables.DepreciationDepreciation commences once assets have been placed in service and is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate that an asset’s useful life is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book values are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 – Property and Equipment of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management’s underlying estimates of useful lives. 42Table of ContentsEvaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for ImpairmentWe assess the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (spectrum licenses) for potential impairment annually as of December 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is tested for impairment based on a two-step test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market method, which is based on market capitalization. We recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. In the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. We believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value. Historically, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach due to the absence of comparable observable market data. The discounted cash flow method utilizes future cash flow assumptions based on estimates of revenues, EBITDA margin and a long-term growth rate taking into consideration expected industry and market conditions. The cash flows are then discounted using a weighted average cost of capital reflecting the risks associated with the business and the projected cash flows. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the second step of the test is performed. In the second step, we determine the fair values of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including those that currently may not be recorded. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the sum of the fair value of all of those assets and liabilities represents the implied goodwill amount. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than the carrying amount of goodwill, then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. We test spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with the management of the overall business at a national level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset group is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset group is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. If the carrying amount of spectrum licenses exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. We estimate the fair value of the spectrum licenses using the Greenfield approach, which is an income approach that estimates the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The Greenfield approach values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses). The value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. We base the assumptions underlying the Greenfield approach on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. Future cash flows in the Greenfield approach are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, EBITDA margin, network build-out period, and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.The valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. If actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. The most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, EBITDA margins and the long-term growth rate. As a result of an impairment test performed in 2012, we recorded an impairment charge on goodwill. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding our annual impairment test and impairment charges.Guarantee Liabilities In 2013, we introduced a handset upgrade program, JUMP!, which provides enrolled customers a specific-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. Participating customers must purchase a device from us, have a qualifying monthly wireless service plan with us, and finance their handset using our EIP, which is treated as a single multiple-element arrangement when entered into at 43Table of Contentsor near the same time. Upon qualifying JUMP! program upgrades, the customers’ remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new handset from us on a new EIP. For customers who enroll in the trade-in program, we defer a portion of equipment sales revenue which represents the estimated value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. The guarantee liabilities are valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which require judgment, including the customer's estimated remaining EIP balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used device at trade-in, and probability and timing of trade-in. When the customer upgrades their device, the difference between the trade-in credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned handset is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. All assumptions are reviewed periodically. Rent Expense Most of the leases on our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of rent payable over time. We calculate straight-line rent expense for each of these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such amount that a renewal appears, at lease inception, to be reasonably assured. We make significant assumptions at lease inception in determining and assessing the factors that constitute a “penalty”. In doing so, we primarily consider costs incurred in acquiring and developing new sites, the useful life of site improvements and equipment costs, future economic conditions and the extent to which improvements in wireless technologies can be incorporated into a current assessment of whether an economic compulsion will exist in the future to renew a lease.Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. A valuation allowance is maintained against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available. We consider many factors when determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to economic risks in the normal course of business, primarily from changes in interest rates. These risks, along with other business risks, impact our cost of capital. Our policy is to manage exposure related to fluctuations in interest rates in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term. We have established interest rate risk limits that are closely monitored by measuring interest rate sensitivities of our debt and embedded derivative instruments portfolios. We do not foresee significant changes in the strategies used to manage market risk in the near future. 44Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskWe are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our long-term debt to affiliates, which consist of the senior reset notes. As of December 31, 2014, we had $5.6 billion in long-term debt with Deutsche Telekom comprised of senior reset notes. Changes in interest rates can lead to significant fluctuations in the fair value of our long-term debt to affiliates. To perform the sensitivity analysis on the long-term debt to affiliates, we assessed the risk of a change in the fair value from the effect of a hypothetical interest rate change of 100 basis points. As of December 31, 2014, the change in the fair value of our long-term debt to affiliates, based on this hypothetical change, is shown in the table below: Fair Value Assuming(in millions)Fair Value +100 Basis Point Shift -100 Basis Point ShiftLong-term debt to affiliates$5,780 $5,744 $5,816To manage interest rate risk, the interest rates on the senior reset notes are adjusted at the reset dates to rates defined in the applicable supplemental indenture. We determined certain components of the reset feature are required to be bifurcated from the senior reset notes and separately accounted for as embedded derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2014, we had $5 million in embedded derivatives related to the senior reset notes. The fair value of the embedded derivatives was determined based on the fair value of the senior reset notes with and without the embedded derivatives included. The fair value of the senior reset notes with the embedded derivatives utilizes the contractual term of each senior reset note, reset rates calculated based on the spread between specified yield curves and the yield curve on certain T-Mobile long-term debt, and interest rate volatility. Interest rate volatility is derived based on weighted risk-free rate volatility and credit spread volatility. Changes in the spreads between the specified yield curves and the yield curve on certain T-Mobile long-term debt can lead to fluctuations in the fair value of our embedded derivatives.To perform sensitivity analysis on the embedded derivatives, we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of a hypothetical spread change between specified yield curves and the yield curve on certain T-Mobile long-term debt of 10 basis points on our portfolio of embedded derivatives. As of December 31, 2014, the change in the fair value of our embedded derivatives, based on this hypothetical change, is shown in the table below: Fair Value Assuming(in millions)Fair Value +10 Basis Point Shift -10 Basis Point ShiftEmbedded derivatives$5 $27 $(17)45Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:44:08.437271
1283699,TMUS,"T-Mobile US, Inc.",2016,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsExcept as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. OverviewThe MD&A is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the three years ended December 31, 2015 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.21Table of ContentsOperating HighlightsWe introduced our Un-carrier proposition in 2013 with the objective of eliminating customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry. We believe the Un-carrier proposition has been successful as evidenced by our strong customer growth momentum since the launch of our Un-carrier proposition. Total net customer additions were 8,264,000 in 2015, broadly consistent compared to 8,334,000 in 2014 and a significant improvement compared to 4,377,000 in 2013. Our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues and we have continued to focus on retaining customers through our Un-carrier initiatives and ongoing network improvements. These initiatives have continued to provide an improved customer experience as evidenced by our strong improvement in branded postpaid phone churn of 1.39% in 2015 compared to 1.58% in 2014 and 1.69% in 2013. In 2015, we introduced JUMP! On Demand which allows customers to lease a new wireless device and upgrade it for a new one up to three times in 12 months for no extra fee. At lease inception, devices are transferred from inventory to property and equipment. Devices are then depreciated to their estimated residual value over the lease term and revenues associated with the leased wireless devices are recognized over the term of the lease. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. As we do not re-lease handset devices, returned devices are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write down to market recognized as cost of equipment sales.Financial HighlightsWe generate revenues by offering affordable wireless communication services to our postpaid, prepaid and wholesale customers, as well as through sales and leasing of a wide selection of wireless devices and accessories. Total revenues increased to $32.1 billion in 2015 compared to $29.6 billion in 2014 and $24.4 billion in 2013. Our most significant expenses are related to acquiring and retaining high-quality customers, providing a full range of devices, compensating employees, and operating and expanding our network. Operating expenses were $30.0 billion in 2015, compared to $28.1 billion in 2014 and $23.4 billion in 2013. Net income increased to $733 million in 2015, compared to $247 million in 2014 and $35 million in 2013. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $7.4 billion in 2015, compared to $5.6 billion in 2014 and $4.9 billion in 2013.Liquidity and Capital Resources HighlightsThe ongoing success of our Un-carrier proposition and continued modernization of our network has further repositioned T-Mobile to provide customers with an exceptional customer experience, which requires substantial investment in our business. We have substantially completed the process of upgrading our network to LTE, which provides our customers with the fastest nationwide 4G LTE network in the United States. In addition, we are currently in the process of building out our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses. Cash capital expenditures for property and equipment, excluding payments for capitalized interest, were $4.5 billion in 2015, compared to $4.3 billion in 2014 and $4.0 billion in 2013. Payments for capitalized interest costs included in purchases of property and equipment were $246 million in 2015, $65 million in 2014 and were not significant in 2013.We provide mobile communication services using spectrum licenses, consisting of 700 MHz A-Block, AWS and PCS licenses. We intend to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future FCC spectrum license auctions, including the broadcast incentive auction in 2016, to further enhance our portfolio of U.S. nationwide broadband spectrum and enable the expansion of LTE coverage to new markets.See “Results of Operations” below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and “Performance Measures” for a description of performance measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA and churn. The comparability of results in this Form 10-K to the year ended 2013 is affected by the inclusion of MetroPCS results after the completion of the business combination on April 30, 2013.22Table of ContentsResults of OperationsSet forth below is a summary of consolidated results: Year Ended December 31, PercentageChange 2015Versus 2014 PercentageChange 2014Versus 2013(in millions)2015 2014 2013 Revenues Branded postpaid revenues$16,383 $14,392 $13,166 14 % 9 %Branded prepaid revenues7,553 6,986 4,945 8 % 41 %Wholesale revenues692 731 613 (5)% 19 %Roaming and other service revenues193 266 344 (27)% (23)%Total service revenues24,821 22,375 19,068 11 % 17 %Equipment revenues6,718 6,789 5,033 (1)% 35 %Other revenues514 400 319 29 % 25 %Total revenues32,053 29,564 24,420 8 % 21 %Operating expenses Cost of services, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below5,554 5,788 5,279 (4)% 10 %Cost of equipment sales9,344 9,621 6,976 (3)% 38 %Selling, general and administrative10,189 8,863 7,382 15 % 20 %Depreciation and amortization4,688 4,412 3,627 6 % 22 %Cost of MetroPCS business combination376 299 108 26 % NMGains on disposal of spectrum licenses(163) (840) (2) (81)% NMOther, net— 5 54 NM (91)%Total operating expenses29,988 28,148 23,424 7 % 20 %Operating income2,065 1,416 996 46 % 42 %Other income (expense) Interest expense(1,085) (1,073) (545) 1 % 97 %Interest expense to affiliates(411) (278) (678) 48 % (59)%Interest income420 359 189 17 % 90 %Other income (expense), net(11) (11) 89 NM NMTotal other expense, net(1,087) (1,003) (945) 8 % 6 %Income before income taxes978 413 51 NM NMIncome tax expense245 166 16 48 % NMNet income$733 $247 $35 NM NMNM – Not MeaningfulYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014RevenuesBranded postpaid revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 14%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of average branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices. Additional increases resulted from customer adoption of upgrade and insurance programs, and an increase in regulatory program revenues. The increase was partially offset by lower branded postpaid phone average revenue per user (“ARPU”). See “Performance Measures” for further information on branded postpaid phone ARPU.Branded prepaid revenues increased $567 million, or 8%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of average branded prepaid customers driven by the success of our MetroPCS brand promotional activities and continued growth in expansion markets. Wholesale revenues decreased $39 million, or 5%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to revised agreements with certain MVNO partners in 2015, partially offset by growth in customers of certain MVNO partners. 23Table of ContentsRoaming and other service revenues decreased $73 million, or 27%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower international roaming revenues driven by changes in contractual arrangements with certain roaming partners and a reduction in early termination fees. Equipment revenues decreased $71 million, or 1%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower average revenue per device sold, due in part to the impact of customers shifting to leasing higher-end devices with JUMP! On Demand, partially offset by growth in the number of devices and accessories sold. With JUMP! On Demand, revenues associated with leased wireless devices are recognized over the term of the lease rather than when the device is delivered to the customer. If customers continue to shift to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand, equipment revenues may continue to decrease in 2016. Despite the increase in the number of devices leased in 2015 following the launch of JUMP! On Demand, the unit volume of device sales increased 5% in 2015, compared to 2014. We financed $5.2 billion of devices through EIP during 2015, a decrease from $5.8 billion in 2014, primarily due to a decline in devices financed through EIP as customers increasingly shifted to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand. Other revenues increased $114 million, or 29%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher non-service revenues from revenue share agreements with third parties.Operating Expenses•Cost of services consists primarily of costs directly attributable to providing wireless service through the operation of our network, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, network access and transport costs, utilities, maintenance, associated labor costs, long distance costs, regulatory program costs, roaming fees paid to other carriers and data content costs.•Cost of equipment sales consists primarily of costs of devices and accessories sold to customers and dealers, device costs to fulfill insurance and warranty claims, write-downs of inventory related to shrinkage and obsolescence, and shipping and handling costs.•Selling, general and administrative consists of costs not directly attributable to providing wireless service for the operation of sales, customer care and corporate activities. These include commissions paid to dealers and retail employees for activations and upgrades, labor and facilities costs associated with retail sales force and administrative space, marketing and promotional costs, customer support and billing, bad debt expense, loss on sale of receivables and administrative support activities.Cost of services decreased $234 million, or 4%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to synergies realized from the decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network and lower lease expense associated with spectrum license lease agreements. Additionally, a reduction in certain regulatory program costs contributed to the decrease. The decrease was partially offset by increases related to our network expansion and build-out of our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum. Cost of equipment sales decreased $277 million, or 3%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower average cost per device sold, mainly due to the impact of customers shifting to leasing higher-end devices with JUMP! On Demand, partially offset by growth in the number of devices and accessories sold. With JUMP! On Demand, the cost of the leased wireless device is capitalized and recognized as depreciation expense over the term of the lease rather than recognized as cost of equipment sales when the device is delivered to the customer. If customers continue to shift to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand, cost of equipment sales may continue to decrease in 2016. Despite the increase in the number of devices leased in 2015 following the launch of JUMP! On Demand, the unit volume of device sales increased 5% in 2015, compared to 2014.Selling, general and administrative increased $1.3 billion, or 15%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily to support the growing customer base, which also increased 15% in 2015, and reflects increases in employee-related costs, promotional costs, commissions, bad debt expense and losses from sales of receivables primarily resulting from growth in the customer base and in the EIP program. Depreciation and amortization increased $276 million, or 6%, in 2015, compared to 2014 primarily driven by $312 million in depreciation expense as a result of the launch of our JUMP! On Demand program. With JUMP! On Demand, the cost of the leased wireless device is depreciated to its estimated residual value over the lease term rather than recognized as cost of 24Table of Contentsequipment sales when the device is delivered to the customer. If customers continue to shift to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand, we expect depreciation associated with leased wireless devices to continue to increase in 2016. Cost of MetroPCS business combination of $376 million in 2015 primarily reflects network decommissioning costs associated with the business combination. In 2014, we began decommissioning the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant network cell sites. On July 1, 2015, T-Mobile officially completed the shutdown of the MetroPCS CDMA network. Network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. Although we expect to incur additional network decommissioning costs in 2016 as cell site assets are removed, these costs are not expected to be significant. See Note 2 – Business Combination with MetroPCS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $163 million in 2015 primarily consisted of a non-cash gain of $139 million from spectrum license transactions with Verizon recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $840 million in 2014 primarily consisted of non-cash gains from spectrum license transactions with Verizon, and to a lesser extent, a non-cash gain from a spectrum license transaction with AT&T during the fourth quarter of 2014. See Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Other Income (Expense) Interest expense increased $12 million, or 1%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher debt balances with third parties in 2015 compared to 2014, partially offset by a decrease from interest costs that were capitalized associated with the build out of our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses. Interest expense to affiliates increased $133 million, or 48%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to changes in the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with the Senior Reset Notes issued to Deutsche Telekom, partially offset by a decrease from interest costs that were capitalized associated with the build out of our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses.Interest income increased $61 million, or 17%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher interest income from devices financed through EIP. Interest associated with EIP receivables is imputed at the time of sale and then recognized over the financed installment term. See Note 4 – Equipment Installment Plan Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Income TaxesIncome tax expense increased $79 million in 2015, compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was 25.1% in 2015, compared to 40.2% in 2014. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the impact of discrete income tax items recognized in 2015, including recent changes in state and local income tax laws and the recognition of foreign tax credits.Net IncomeNet income increased $486 million in 2015, compared to 2014, as a result of the factors described above.25Table of ContentsGuarantor SubsidiariesPursuant to the indenture and the supplemental indentures, the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties of T-Mobile USA, Inc. (“Issuer”), excluding Senior Secured Term Loans and capital leases, is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile US, Inc. (“Parent”) and certain of the Issuer’s 100% owned subsidiaries (“Guarantor Subsidiaries”). Additionally, T-Mobile USA incurred $2.0 billion of Senior Secured Term Loans in 2015, which are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of T-Mobile USA’s assets and the assets of T-Mobile USA’s Guarantor Subsidiaries. In addition, the Senior Secured Term Loans are subject to a first priority pledge of the equity interests held by T-Mobile USA and substantially all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. In the fourth quarter of 2015, T-Mobile entered into an arrangement to sell certain EIP accounts receivable on a revolving basis. In connection with the sales arrangement, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary to sell EIP accounts receivables (“EIP BRE”), which is included in the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries condensed consolidating financial information. See Note 3 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.The financial condition of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries is substantially similar to the Company’s consolidated financial condition. Similarly, the results of operations of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries are substantially similar to the Company’s consolidated results of operations. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the most significant components of the financial condition of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries were property and equipment of $454 million and $537 million, respectively, tower obligations of $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, and stockholders’ deficit of $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. The most significant components of the results of operations of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries in 2015 were service revenues of $1.7 billion, partially offset by costs of equipment sales of $720 million and selling, general and administrative expenses of $733 million resulting in a net comprehensive income of $60 million. In 2014, service revenues of $1.3 billion were offset by costs of equipment sales of $702 million, selling, general and administrative expenses of $518 million and other items resulting in a net comprehensive loss of $38 million. See Note 15 – Guarantor Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013RevenuesBranded postpaid revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 9%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of average branded postpaid customers driven by the continued success of our Un-carrier proposition and strong customer response to promotions for services and devices. Additional increases resulted from customer adoption of upgrade and insurance programs and changes in requalification requirements for corporate discount programs. The increase was partially offset by lower branded postpaid average revenue per account (“ARPA”). See “Performance Measures” for further information on ARPA. Branded postpaid ARPA was negatively impacted by continued growth of our Simple Choice plans, which have lower monthly service charges compared to traditional bundled plans. Branded postpaid customers on Simple Choice plans increased over the past twelve months to 89% of the branded postpaid customer base as of December 31, 2014, compared to 69% as of December 31, 2013.Branded prepaid revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 41%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily driven by growth of the customer base from the expansion of the MetroPCS brand and an increase in promotional activities. In addition, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period following the business combination in April 2013 contributed to the increase. Wholesale revenues increased $118 million, or 19%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in customer programs and monthly plans, including data, offered by our MVNO partners and changes to our MVNO contractual arrangements. Roaming and other service revenues decreased $78 million, or 23%, in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to a decline in early termination fees (“ETFs”) following our introduction of the no annual service contract feature of the Simple Choice plan launched in March 2013. Equipment sales increased $1.8 billion, or 35%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the number of devices sold due to higher gross customer additions and higher device upgrade volumes, including JUMP! redemptions. The volume of device sales increased 48% in 2014, compared to 2013. Additionally, the 26Table of Contentsinclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013 contributed to the increase. The increase was partially offset by reimbursements of other carriers’ ETFs and a lower average revenue per device sold.We financed $5.8 billion of equipment sales revenues through EIP during 2014, an increase from $3.3 billion in 2013, resulting from growth of our Simple Choice plans. Additionally, customers had associated EIP billings of $3.6 billion in 2014, compared to $1.5 billion in 2013. Other revenues increased $81 million, or 25%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher co-location rental income from leasing space on wireless communication towers to third parties and higher lease income associated with spectrum license lease agreements resulting from spectrum swap transactions.Operating ExpensesCost of services increased $509 million, or 10%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013. Additionally, higher lease expense primarily relating to spectrum license lease agreements resulting from spectrum swap transactions contributed to the increase. Cost of equipment sales increased $2.6 billion, or 38%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the number of devices sold due to higher gross customer additions and higher device upgrade volumes, including JUMP! redemptions. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013 contributed to the increase. The volume of device sales increased 48% in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was partially offset by a lower average cost per device sold.Selling, general and administrative increased $1.5 billion, or 20%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs as a result of increases in the number of retail and customer support employees, higher commissions driven by increased gross customer additions and higher promotional costs. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013 and higher stock-based compensation contributed to the increase. Depreciation and amortization increased $785 million, or 22%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily associated with the build-out of the T-Mobile LTE network, which increased the depreciable asset base. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013, including accelerated depreciation related to the decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network, contributed to the increase.Cost of MetroPCS business combination of $299 million in 2014 primarily reflects network decommissioning costs associated with the business combination. In 2014, we began decommissioning the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant network cell sites. Network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. See Note 2 – Business Combination with MetroPCS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information. Cost of MetroPCS business combination of $108 million in 2013 reflects personnel-related costs and professional services costs associated with the business combination.Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $840 million in 2014 primarily consisted of non-cash gains from spectrum license transactions with Verizon, and to a lesser extent, a non-cash gain from a spectrum license transaction with AT&T during the fourth quarter of 2014. See Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Other, net decreased $49 million, or 91%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to our 2013 restructuring program to align our operations to our new strategy and position the company for future growth. Costs associated with the 2013 restructuring program primarily consisted of severance and other personnel-related costs.Other Income (Expense) Interest expense increased $528 million, or 97%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily the result of higher debt balances in 2014 compared to 2013, including Senior Notes issued in 2013, the assumption of MetroPCS long-term debt in 27Table of Contentsconnection with the business combination in April 2013, the reclassification of non-reset notes from long-term debt to affiliates to long-term debt following Deutsche Telekom’s sale of the non-reset notes in October 2013, and to a lesser extent, the issuance of new senior unsecured notes in September 2014. Interest expense to affiliates decreased $400 million, or 59%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower debt balances with Deutsche Telekom in 2014, resulting from the recapitalization of T-Mobile prior to the business combination in April 2013 and Deutsche Telekom’s sale of non-reset notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.6 billion in October 2013. To a lesser extent, additional decreases resulted from fair value adjustments related to embedded derivative instruments associated with the Senior Reset Notes issued to Deutsche Telekom in the recapitalization. Interest income increased $170 million, or 90%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was the result of significant growth in devices financed through EIP. Interest associated with EIP receivables is imputed at the time of sale and then recognized over the financed installment term. Other income (expense), net decreased $100 million in 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the recognition of foreign currency translation gains in 2013 related to the retirement of derivative instruments prior to the business combination in April 2013. This decrease was offset in part by a non-cash gain recognized in 2014 on the extinguishment of $1.0 billion of 7.875% Senior Notes due in 2018. Income TaxesIncome tax expense increased $150 million in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax income. The effective tax rate was 40.2% in 2014, compared to 31.4% in 2013. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance on certain state income tax attributes, which was partially offset by an increase in federal tax credits and a reduction in the effect of Puerto Rico taxes on the effective tax rate.Net IncomeNet income increased $212 million in 2014, compared to 2013, as a result of the factors described above.Guarantor SubsidiariesPursuant to the indenture and the supplemental indentures, the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile US, Inc. (“Parent”) and certain of T-Mobile USA’s (“Issuer”) 100% owned subsidiaries (“Guarantor Subsidiaries”). In 2014, T-Mobile entered into a two-year arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis. In connection with the arrangement, the Company formed the Service BRE, which is included in the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries condensed consolidating financial information. See Note 3 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.The financial condition of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries is substantially similar to the Company’s consolidated financial condition.

The most significant components of the results of operations of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries in 2013, were service revenues of $823 million offset by costs of equipment sales of $552 million, resulting in a net comprehensive loss of $52 million.28Table of ContentsPerformance MeasuresIn managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by the financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures. These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate key operating performance comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry.Total CustomersA customer is generally defined as a SIM card with a unique T-Mobile identity number which is associated with an account that generates revenue. Branded customers generally include customers that are qualified either for postpaid service utilizing phones or mobile broadband devices (including tablets), where they generally pay after incurring service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance.

At December 31, 2014, we had 55.0 million customers, an 18% increase from the customer total as of December 31, 2013, as a result of growth in the customer categories described below. Branded CustomersBranded postpaid phone net customer additions were 3,511,000 in 2015, compared to 4,047,000 in 2014. Branded postpaid phone net customer additions remained strong in 2015 driven by positive customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives, ongoing network improvements and promotional activities. Branded postpaid phone gross customer additions in 2015 were lower compared to 2014, which included the introduction of Un-carrier 4.0 Contract Freedom and certain attractive family rate 29Table of Contentsplan promotions. Included in the branded postpaid phone net customer additions were approximately 765,000 qualified branded prepaid customers upgrading to branded postpaid plans in 2015, compared to approximately 420,000 in 2014.Branded postpaid phone net customer additions were 4,047,000 in 2014, compared to branded postpaid phone net customer additions of 1,938,000 in 2013. The increase in customer development was attributable to increased new customer activations and improved branded postpaid phone churn driven by the continued success of our Un-carrier proposition and strong customer response to promotions for services and devices. Additional increases in customer development resulted from the launch of new popular devices.Branded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions were 999,000 in 2015, compared to 839,000 in 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher gross customer additions driven by promotions for mobile broadband devices, partially offset by higher deactivations resulting from the discontinuation of certain promotional pricing for mobile broadband services and ongoing competitive activity in the marketplace. Branded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions were 839,000 in 2014, compared to branded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions of 68,000 in 2013. The significant increase was driven by strong customer response to promotions for mobile broadband services and devices. Branded prepaid net customer additions were 1,315,000 in 2015, compared to 1,244,000 in 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher gross customer additions driven by the success of our MetroPCS brand promotional activities and continued growth in expansion markets. Included in the branded prepaid net customer additions were approximately 765,000 qualified branded prepaid customers upgrading to branded postpaid plans in 2015, compared to approximately 420,000 in 2014.Branded prepaid net customer additions were 1,244,000 in 2014, compared to 328,000 branded prepaid net customer additions, excluding customers of MetroPCS acquired as a result of the business combination, in 2013. The increase in customer development was attributable to higher branded prepaid gross customer additions due to the growth and expansion of the MetroPCS brand, including the launch into additional markets following the MetroPCS business combination in April 2013. This increase was offset, in part, by higher deactivations from the competitive environment in the prepaid market.WholesaleWholesale net customer additions were 2,439,000 in 2015, compared to 2,204,000 in 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher MVNO gross customer additions, partially offset by higher MVNO deactivations.Wholesale net customer additions were 2,204,000 in 2014, compared to wholesale net customer additions of 2,043,000 in 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to higher M2M gross customer additions resulting from strong activation volume, partially offset by a decrease in MVNO net customer additions driven by higher churn. T-Mobile offers its M2M customers innovative products and solutions to assist them in embracing the Internet of Things (“IoT”). MVNO customers continued to grow, although at a slower rate in 2014 than 2013. MVNO partners often have relationships with multiple carriers and through steering their business towards carriers offering promotions, can impact specific carriers’ results. Customers Per AccountCustomers per account is calculated by dividing the number of branded postpaid customers as of the end of the period by the number of branded postpaid accounts as of the end of the period. An account may include branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers. We believe branded postpaid customers per account provides management with useful information to evaluate our branded postpaid customer base on a per account basis. Year Ended December 31,2015 2014 2013Branded postpaid customers per account2.54 2.36 2.18Branded postpaid customers per account were 2.54 as of December 31, 2015, compared to 2.36 as of December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by service promotions targeting families and increased penetration of mobile broadband devices. 30Table of ContentsBranded postpaid customers per account were 2.36 as of December 31, 2014, compared to 2.18 as of December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average number of branded postpaid phone customers per account resulting from promotions for services, including the “4 for $100” offer, and increased penetration of mobile broadband devices.ChurnChurn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period. The number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored. We believe that churn provides management with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty. Year Ended December 31,2015 2014 2013Branded postpaid phone churn1.39% 1.58% 1.69%Branded prepaid churn4.45% 4.76% 5.37%Branded postpaid phone churn was 1.39% in 2015, a 19 basis point improvement compared to 1.58% in 2014. The improvement in branded postpaid phone churn reflects ongoing improvements to network quality, customer service and the overall value of our offerings in the marketplace, resulting in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.Branded postpaid phone churn was 1.58% in 2014, an 11 basis point improvement compared to 1.69% in 2013. The improvement in branded postpaid phone churn was impacted by the continued success of our Un-carrier initiatives resulting in increased customer loyalty.Branded prepaid churn was 4.45% in 2015, compared to 4.76% in 2014. Branded prepaid churn for 2015 was impacted by a methodology change during 2015 that had no impact on our reported branded prepaid ending customers or net customer additions, but resulted in computationally lower gross customer additions and deactivations. Revision of prior periods was not practicable because certain historical data was no longer available. Branded prepaid churn was 4.76% in 2014, a 61 basis point improvement compared to 5.37% in 2013. The improvement was primarily due to the inclusion and growth of MetroPCS customers, which represent the largest portion of the branded prepaid customer base and historically have lower rates of churn than T-Mobile branded prepaid customers. Average Revenue Per User, Average Billings Per User, Average Revenue Per Account and Average Billings Per Account Average Revenue Per User (“ARPU”) represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue realization per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. Branded postpaid phone ARPU excludes mobile broadband customers and related revenues. Average Billings Per User (“ABPU”) represents the average monthly customer billings, including monthly lease revenues and EIP billings, per customer. We believe branded postpaid ABPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate average branded postpaid customer billings as it is indicative of estimated cash collections, including device financing payments, from our customers each month.Average Revenue Per Account (“ARPA”) represents the average monthly branded postpaid service revenue earned per account. An account may include branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers. Average Billings Per Account (“ABPA”) represents the average monthly branded postpaid customer billings, including monthly lease revenues and EIP billings, per account. To streamline the number of key performance metrics T-Mobile discloses, we will discontinue reporting branded postpaid ARPA and ABPA after the fourth quarter of 2015. Going forward, we will continue reporting branded postpaid customers per account which may be used, along with our branded postpaid service revenues, to assess performance on a per account basis.31Table of ContentsThe following tables illustrate the calculation of ARPU and ABPU and reconcile these measures to the related service revenues, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to ARPU and ABPU: Year Ended December 31,(in millions, except average number of customers, ARPU and ABPU)2015 2014 2013Calculation of Branded Postpaid Phone ARPU Branded postpaid service revenues$16,383 $14,392 $13,166Less: Branded postpaid mobile broadband revenues(588) (261) (169)Branded postpaid phone service revenues$15,795 $14,131 $12,997Divided by: Average number of branded postpaid phone customers (in thousands) and number of months in period 27,604 23,817 20,424Branded postpaid phone ARPU$47.68 $49.44 $53.03 Calculation of Branded Postpaid ABPU Branded postpaid service revenues$16,383 $14,392 $13,166EIP billings5,494 3,596 1,471Lease revenues224 — —Total billings for branded postpaid customers$22,101 $17,988 $14,637Divided by: Average number of branded postpaid customers (in thousands) and number of months in period29,341 24,683 20,858Branded postpaid ABPU$62.77 $60.73 $58.48 Calculation of Branded Prepaid ARPU Branded prepaid service revenues$7,553 $6,986 $4,945Divided by: Average number of branded prepaid customers (in thousands) and number of months in period 16,704 15,691 11,913Branded prepaid ARPU$37.68 $37.10 $34.59The following tables illustrate the calculation of ARPA and ABPA and reconcile these measures to the related service revenues, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to ARPA and ABPA: Year Ended December 31,(in millions, except average number of accounts, ARPA and ABPA)2015 2014 2013Calculation of Branded Postpaid ARPA Branded postpaid service revenues$16,383 $14,392 $13,166Divided by: Average number of branded postpaid accounts (in thousands) and number of months in period12,028 11,008 9,638Branded postpaid ARPA$113.50 $108.95 $113.84 Calculation of Branded Postpaid ABPA Branded postpaid service revenues$16,383 $14,392 $13,166EIP billings5,494 3,596 1,471Lease revenues224 — —Total billings for branded postpaid customers$22,101 $17,988 $14,637Divided by: Average number of branded postpaid accounts (in thousands) and number of months in period12,028 11,008 9,638Branded postpaid ABPA$153.12 $136.17 $126.55Branded Postpaid Phone ARPU and Branded Postpaid ABPU:Branded postpaid phone ARPU decreased $1.76, or 4%, for 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to dilution from the continued growth of customers on Simple Choice plans and promotions targeting families. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in regulatory program revenues. Branded postpaid phone ARPU decreased $3.59, or 7%, for 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the continued growth of customers on Simple Choice plans, which have lower monthly service charges compared to traditional bundled plans, and promotions for services, including the “4 for $100” offer. 32Table of ContentsBranded postpaid ABPU increased $2.04, or 3%, for 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in devices financed by customers through the EIP and JUMP! on Demand programs, partially offset by lower branded postpaid phone ARPU, as described above. Branded postpaid ABPU increased $2.25, or 4%, for 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to growth in devices financed through EIP, offset in part by lower branded postpaid phone ARPU. Branded Prepaid ARPU:Branded prepaid ARPU increased $0.58, or 2%, for 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the mix of branded prepaid customers choosing plans with more data, which generate a higher ARPU, partially offset by dilution from growth of customers on rate plan promotions.Branded prepaid ARPU increased $2.51, or 7%, for 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion and growth of the MetroPCS customer base, which generate higher ARPU than the rest of T-Mobile’s branded prepaid customers. Branded Postpaid ARPA and Branded Postpaid ABPA:Branded postpaid ARPA increased $4.55, or 4%, for 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to an increasing number of branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers per account and an increase in regulatory program revenues, partially offset by dilution from continued growth of customers on promotions targeting families. Branded postpaid ARPA decreased $4.89, or 4%, for 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the continued growth of customers on Simple Choice plans, which have lower monthly service charges compared to traditional bundled plans, and promotions for services, including the “4 for $100” offer. Branded postpaid ABPA increased $16.95, or 12%, for 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in devices financed by customers through the EIP and JUMP! on Demand programs and an increase in branded postpaid ARPA, as described above. Branded postpaid ABPA increased $9.62, or 8%, for 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to growth in devices financed through EIP, offset in part by lower branded postpaid ARPA, as described above. Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest expense (net of interest income), tax, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and expenses not reflective of T-Mobile’s operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a metric to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because it is more indicative of our ongoing performance and trends by excluding certain expenses which are either nonrecurring or may not be indicative of our directly controllable operating results. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. 33Table of ContentsThe following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure: Year Ended December 31,(in millions)2015 2014 2013Net income $733 $247 $35Adjustments: Interest expense 1,085 1,073 545Interest expense to affiliates411 278 678Interest income(420) (359) (189)Other expense (income), net11 11 (89)Income tax expense245 166 16Operating income 2,065 1,416 996Depreciation and amortization4,688 4,412 3,627Cost of MetroPCS business combination376 299 108Stock-based compensation (1)222 211 100Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses (1)— (720) —Other, net (1)42 18 54Adjusted EBITDA$7,393 $5,636 $4,885Adjusted EBITDA margin30% 25% 26%(1)Stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree to stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements. Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses and Other, net transactions may not agree to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) primarily due to certain routine operating activities, such as routine spectrum license exchanges that would be expected to reoccur, and are therefore included in Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased 31% for 2015, compared to 2014. Adjusted EBITDA benefited from increased branded postpaid and prepaid revenues driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and the ongoing success of our promotional activities. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by focused cost control and synergies realized from the MetroPCS business combination, especially in cost of services. Decreased losses on equipment also contributed to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the impact of customers shifting to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand as the related costs are capitalized and depreciated over the lease term and are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. In connection with JUMP! On Demand, we had lease revenues of $224 million and depreciation expense of $312 million related to leased wireless devices in 2015. These increases were partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA increased 15% for 2014, compared to 2013. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by increased branded postpaid revenues resulting from the continued success of our Un-carrier value proposition and strong customer response to promotional activities, as well as the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results since the business combination in 2013, including branded prepaid revenue growth from expansion of the MetroPCS brand. This increase was partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and losses on equipment sales.Free Cash FlowFree Cash Flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less payments for purchases of property and equipment. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management, investors and analysts of T-Mobile’s financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business. The following table illustrates the calculation of Free Cash Flow and reconciles Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure: Year Ended December 31,(in millions)2015 2014 2013Net cash provided by operating activities$5,414 $4,146 $3,545Cash purchases of property and equipment(4,724) (4,317) (4,025)Free Cash Flow$690 $(171) $(480)Free Cash Flow increased $861 million for 2015, compared to 2014, and $309 million for 2014, compared to 2013. The increases were primarily due to higher net cash provided by operating activities resulting from total revenue growth in excess 34Table of Contentsof total operating expense growth, partially offset by higher purchases of property and equipment. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt, common and preferred stock, the sale of certain receivables and financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms. In addition, we maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom that allows for up to $500 million in borrowings. As of December 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents were $4.6 billion and our short-term investments were $3.0 billion. We generated net cash provided by operating activities of $5.4 billion in 2015, compared to $4.1 billion in 2014 and $3.5 billion in 2013. As of December 31, 2015, our total debt was $26.3 billion, excluding our tower obligations as described Note 9 – Tower Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.The following were the primary changes in sources of liquidity in 2015:•We issued new Senior Notes to third parties in aggregate principal amounts of $2.0 billion and incurred $2.0 billion of Senior Secured Term Loans in the fourth quarter of 2015.•We entered into master lease agreements with certain partners, which provide us with the ability to enter into capital lease agreements for network equipment up to $750 million. In 2015, we entered into capital lease agreements of $470 million.•We introduced JUMP! On Demand, which allows eligible customers the option to lease their devices over a period of up to 18 months. If the mix of devices financed through EIP or leases continue to increase, device financing programs will continue to require a greater use of operating cash flows in the short term since cash collections are received over the EIP or lease term.•As an additional source of liquidity, we entered into an $800 million arrangement to sell certain EIP receivables on a revolving basis of which $150 million is scheduled to expire July 2016 and $650 million is scheduled to expire November 2017. See Note 3 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.We could seek additional sources of liquidity through the issuance of long-term debt in 2016 to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future FCC spectrum license auctions, including the broadcast incentive auction in 2016. In addition to the $4.0 billion in proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes to third parties and Senior Secured Term Loans in 2015, we believe we have the capacity to raise an additional $6.0 billion in debt to fund such spectrum acquisitions, subject to market and other conditions, without adversely impacting our credit ratings. Excluding any additional liquidity needed to acquire spectrum, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements in the next 12 months and intend to use our principal sources of funding for general corporate purposes, including capital investments other than spectrum licenses, and enhancing our financial flexibility. We determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment. The indentures and credit facilities governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the Issuer to loan funds or make payments to the Parent. However, the Issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the Parent under the terms of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of December 31, 2015.35Table of ContentsCapital ExpendituresOur liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure.The property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to our network modernization, including the build out of LTE 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses. We expect cash capital expenditures for property and equipment to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion in 2016. This does not include property and equipment obtained through capital lease agreements, leased wireless devices transferred from inventory or purchases of spectrum licenses.Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31,(in millions)2015 2014 2013Net cash provided by operating activities$5,414 $4,146 $3,545Net cash used in investing activities(9,560) (7,246) (2,092)Net cash provided by financing activities3,413 2,524 4,044Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $5.4 billion in 2015, compared to $4.1 billion in 2014. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2015 primarily as a result of increased operating income from growth of branded postpaid and branded prepaid revenues partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs. Additionally, proceeds from the sale of certain EIP receivables contributed to the increase. This increase was partially offset by the timing of working capital payments and device financing through EIP and the introduction of T-Mobile’s JUMP! On Demand wireless device leasing program.Cash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion in 2014, compared to $3.5 billion in 2013. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities was driven by several factors. Our operating income, exclusive of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization and gains from spectrum license transactions, increased slightly compared to the prior year. This was primarily a result of increases in branded postpaid revenues due to our acceleration of customer growth partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs and losses on equipment sales. Net changes in working capital increased slightly. This was primarily a result of increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of vendor payments and proceeds from the sales of certain service receivables related to the factoring arrangement. The increases in working capital were mostly offset by increases in EIP receivables as a result of significant growth in devices financed through EIP and increases in inventories.Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities was $9.6 billion in 2015, compared to $7.2 billion used in 2014. In 2015, cash used in investing activities consisted of purchases of property and equipment of $4.7 billion due primarily to the build out of our LTE network, purchases of short-term investments of $3.0 billion and purchases of intangible assets of $1.9 billion primarily due to $1.4 billion of AWS spectrum licenses acquired through the AWS auction conducted by the FCC.Cash used in investing activities was $7.2 billion in 2014, compared to $2.1 billion used in 2013. In 2014, cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of purchases of property and equipment of $4.3 billion as a result of our network modernization and purchases of intangible assets of $2.9 billion due primarily to the acquisition of 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses. In 2013, cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of purchases of property and equipment of $4.0 billion as a result of our network modernization. This was partially offset by cash and cash equivalents acquired in connection with the business combination with MetroPCS of $2.1 billion and the settlement of a short-term loan receivable, net with Deutsche Telekom of $300 million.36Table of ContentsFinancing ActivitiesCash provided by financing activities was $3.4 billion in 2015, compared to $2.5 billion in 2014. In 2015, cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $4.0 billion partially offset by net repayments of short-term debt of $564 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $2.5 billion in 2014, compared to $4.0 billion in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to higher repayments of long-term debt of $1.0 billion, lower net proceeds from the issuance of stock of $805 million, higher net repayments of short-term debt of $174 million and lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $110 million. The decrease was partially offset by higher net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $499 million.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of December 31, 2015 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods:(in millions)Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years More Than 5 Years TotalLong-term debt (1)$20 $540 $6,040 $18,600 $25,200Interest on long-term debt1,559 3,194 2,860 2,804 10,417Capital lease obligations, including interest199 347 184 267 997Tower obligations (2)179 360 361 1,315 2,215Operating leases2,379 4,281 3,579 5,583 15,822Purchase obligations (3)2,865 3,922 1,343 1,304 9,434Network decommissioning (4)129 175 109 82 495Total contractual obligations$7,330 $12,819 $14,476 $29,955 $64,580(1)Represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment, capital lease obligations and vendor financing arrangements. See Note 8 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.(2)Future minimum payments, including principal and interest payments and imputed lease rental income, related to the tower obligations. See Note 9 – Tower Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.(3)T-Mobile calculated the minimum obligation for certain agreements to purchase goods or services based on termination fees that can be paid to exit the contract. Termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due in less than one year, as this is the earliest T-Mobile could exit these contracts. For certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. This table does not include open purchase orders as of December 31, 2015 under normal business purposes. See Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.(4)Represents future undiscounted cash flows related to decommissioned MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant cell sites as of December 31, 2015. See Note 2 – Business Combination with MetroPCS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. Other long-term liabilities, excluding network decommissioning, have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor of such payments. In addition, because dividends on preferred stock are subject to approval by our Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred and the dividend has not been paid. See Note 14 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.The purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase handsets and accessories, equipment, software, programming and network services, and marketing activities, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent T-Mobile’s entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which T-Mobile is contractually committed. Where T-Mobile is committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether it takes delivery, T-Mobile has included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. Additionally, included within purchase obligations are amounts for the acquisition of spectrum licenses, which are subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.37Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain EIP accounts receivable on a revolving basis through November 2017 as an additional source of liquidity. In 2014, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis through March 2017 as an additional source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2015, T-Mobile derecognized net receivables of $1.9 billion upon sale through these arrangements. See Note 3 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Related Party TransactionsSee Note 14 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding related party transactions.Disclosure of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law. As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates in 2015 that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with Deutsche Telekom. We have relied upon Deutsche Telekom for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.Deutsche Telekom, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: Gostaresh Ertebatat Taliya, Irancell Telecommunications Services Company (“MTN Irancell”), Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran. In 2015, gross revenues of all Deutsche Telekom affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic with Iran were less than $1 million and estimated net profits were less than $1 million. In addition, Deutsche Telekom, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, operating a fixed line network in their respective European home countries (in particular Germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the Embassy of Iran in those European countries. Gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities in 2015 were less than $0.1 million. We understand that Deutsche Telekom intends to continue these activities. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results as they require the use of estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.These policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.AllowancesWe maintain an allowance for estimated losses inherent in the accounts receivable portfolio. When determining the allowance, we consider a number of factors, including historical experience and current collection trends, aging of the receivable portfolio, credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions. Credit collection risks are assessed for each type of receivable, such as EIP receivables, based upon historical and expected write-offs, net of recoveries, and an analysis of the aged accounts receivable balances with reserves generally increasing as the 38Table of Contentsreceivable ages. To the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends or assumptions, the required allowance amounts could differ from the estimate. We write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date.We offer certain retail customers the option to pay for devices and other accessories in installments using an EIP. At the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest as there is no stated rate of interest on the EIP receivables and record the EIP receivables at their present value, which is determined by discounting future payments at the imputed interest rate. The difference between the present value of the EIP receivables and their face amount results in a discount which is recorded as a direct reduction to the carrying value with a corresponding reduction to equipment revenues. We determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rates and the amount of expected credit losses on the EIP receivables. As a result, we do not recognize a separate valuation allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable. The imputed discount on EIP receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as interest income in Other income (expense), net.Subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we assess the need for and, if necessary, recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated probable losses on the gross EIP receivables exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances. Total imputed discount and allowances as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately 8.2% and 7.4%, respectively, of the total amount of gross accounts receivable, including EIP receivables.DepreciationDepreciation commences once assets have been placed in service and is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset. Leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to T-Mobile, which is generally the lease term. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history, assumptions about technology evolution and expected loss of leased wireless devices. When these factors indicate that an asset’s useful life is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book values are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 – Property and Equipment of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management’s underlying estimates of useful lives. Evaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for ImpairmentWe assess the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (spectrum licenses) for potential impairment annually as of December 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is tested for impairment based on a two-step test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. We recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. In the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. We believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value. Prior to the business combination, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach due to the absence of comparable observable market data. The discounted cash flow method utilizes future cash flow assumptions based on estimates of revenues, EBITDA margin and a long-term growth rate taking into consideration expected industry and market conditions. The cash flows are then discounted using a weighted average cost of capital reflecting the risks associated with the business and the projected cash flows. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the second step of the test is performed. 39Table of ContentsIn the second step, we determine the fair values of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including those that currently may not be recorded. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the sum of the fair value of all of those assets and liabilities represents the implied goodwill amount. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than the carrying amount of goodwill, then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. We test spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with the management of the overall business at a national level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset group is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset group is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. If the carrying amount of spectrum licenses exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. We estimate the fair value of the spectrum licenses using the Greenfield approach, which is an income approach that estimates the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The Greenfield approach values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses). The value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. We base the assumptions underlying the Greenfield approach on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. Future cash flows in the Greenfield approach are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, EBITDA margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.The valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. If actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. The most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, EBITDA margins and the long-term growth rate. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding our annual impairment test and impairment charges.Guarantee Liabilities In 2013, we introduced a handset upgrade program, JUMP!, which provides enrolled customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. Participating customers must purchase a device from us, have a qualifying monthly wireless service plan with us, and finance their handset using our EIP, which is treated as a single multiple-element arrangement when entered into at or near the same time. Upon qualifying JUMP! program upgrades, the customers’ remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new handset from us on a new EIP. For customers who enroll in the trade-in program, we defer a portion of revenue which represents the estimated value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. The guarantee liabilities are valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which require judgment, including the customer's estimated remaining EIP balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used device at trade-in, and probability and timing of trade-in. When the customer upgrades their device, the difference between the trade-in credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned handset is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. All assumptions are reviewed periodically. Rent Expense Most of the leases on our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of rent payable over time. We calculate straight-line rent expense for each of these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such amount that a renewal appears, at lease inception or significant modification, to be reasonably assured. We make significant assumptions at lease inception in determining and assessing the factors that constitute a “penalty.” In doing so, we primarily consider costs incurred in acquiring and developing new sites, the useful life of site improvements and equipment costs, future economic conditions and the extent to which improvements in wireless technologies can be incorporated into a current assessment of whether an economic compulsion will exist in the future to renew a lease.Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. A valuation allowance 40Table of Contentsis maintained against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available. We consider many factors when determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to economic risks in the normal course of business, primarily from changes in interest rates. These risks, along with other business risks, impact our cost of capital. Our policy is to manage exposure related to fluctuations in interest rates in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term. We have established interest rate risk limits that are closely monitored by measuring interest rate sensitivities of our debt portfolio. We do not foresee significant changes in the strategies used to manage market risk in the near future.We are exposed to changes in interest rates on our 5.950% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2023 and Senior Secured Term Loans. See Note 8 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information. Changes in interest rates can lead to significant fluctuations in fair value. To perform the sensitivity analysis, we assessed the risk of a change in the fair value from the effect of a hypothetical interest rate change of 100 basis points. As of December 31, 2015, the change in the fair value of our 5.950% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2023 and Senior Secured Term Loans, based on this hypothetical change, is shown in the table below: Carrying Amount Fair Value Fair Value Assuming(in millions) +100 Basis Point Shift -100 Basis Point Shift5.950% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2023 (reset date in April 2016)$600 $644 $637 $651Senior Secured Term Loans2,000 1,990 1,882 2,105To manage interest rate risk, the interest rates on the senior reset notes are adjusted at the reset dates to rates defined in the applicable supplemental indenture. We determined certain components of the reset feature are required to be bifurcated from the senior reset notes and separately accounted for as embedded derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2015, we had $143 million in embedded derivatives related to the senior reset notes, of which $44 million related to the 5.950% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2023 that are subject to the reset provisions. The fair value of the embedded derivatives was determined based on the fair value of the senior reset notes with and without the embedded derivatives included. The fair value of the senior reset notes with the embedded derivatives utilizes the contractual term of each senior reset note, reset rates calculated based on the spread between specified yield curves and the yield curve on certain T-Mobile long-term debt and interest rate volatility. Interest rate volatility is derived based on weighted risk-free rate volatility and credit spread volatility. Changes in the spreads between the specified yield curves and the yield curve on certain T-Mobile long-term debt can lead to fluctuations in the fair value of our embedded derivatives.To perform sensitivity analysis on the embedded derivatives, we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of a hypothetical spread change between specified yield curves and the yield curve on certain T-Mobile long-term debt of 10 basis points on our portfolio of embedded derivatives. As of December 31, 2015, the change in the fair value of our embedded 41Table of Contentsderivatives, based on this hypothetical change, is shown in the table below: Fair Value Assuming(in millions)Fair Value +10 Basis Point Shift -10 Basis Point ShiftEmbedded derivatives$143 $140 $14542Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:44:10.099592

Our branded postpaid net customer additions remained strong with 4.1 million in 2016, compared to 4.5 million in 2015 and 4.9 million in 2014, primarily driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives, ongoing improvements to network quality, and promotions for services and devices. In addition, we continue to buildout our Extended Range LTE, which operates on our low-band 700 MHz A-Block spectrum. These results reinforce our position as an organization with a strong focus and commitment to providing an outstanding customer experience.Aligned Cost StructureWe continue to pursue a low-cost business operating model to drive cost savings, which can then be reinvested in the business. These cost-reduction programs are on-going as we continue to simplify our business and drive operational efficiencies and cost savings in areas, such as network optimization, customer roaming and customer service. A portion of these savings have been, and will continue to be, reinvested into growth of our business.CustomersWe provide wireless communication services to three primary categories of customers: •Branded postpaid customers generally include customers that are qualified to pay after using wireless communication services;•Branded prepaid customers generally include customers who pay for wireless communication services in advance. Our branded prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and MetroPCS; and•Wholesale customers include Machine-to-Machine (“M2M”) and MVNO that operate on our network, but are managed by wholesale partners.We generate the majority of our service revenues by providing wireless communication services to branded postpaid and branded prepaid customers. Our ability to acquire and retain branded postpaid and prepaid customers is important to our business in the generation of service revenues, equipment revenues and other revenues. In 2016, our service revenues generated by providing wireless communication services by customer category were:•65% branded postpaid customers;•31% branded prepaid customers; and •4% wholesale customers, roaming and other services. Services and ProductsWe provide wireless communication services through a variety of service plan options. We also offer a wide selection of wireless devices, including smartphones, tablets and other mobile communication devices, which are manufactured by various suppliers. Services, devices and accessories are offered directly to consumers through our owned and operated retail stores, as 5Table of Contentswell as through our websites. In addition, we sell devices to dealers and other third party distributors for resale through independent third-party retail outlets and a variety of third-party websites.Our service plan offerings, which allow customers to subscribe for wireless services separately from the purchase of a device include: •Our T-Mobile ONE plan (T-Mobile ONE), which was launched in September 2016 as phase 12.0 of our Un-carrier initiatives. T-Mobile ONE gives our customers unlimited calls, unlimited text and unlimited high-speed 4G LTE data on their device. On T-Mobile ONE, video typically streams at DVD (480p) quality and tethering is at maximum 3G speeds. Customers can choose to add on additional features to T-Mobile ONE for an additional cost.

On T-Mobile ONE Plus International, customers receive the benefits of T-Mobile ONE Plus as well as free and reduced calling from the U.S. to foreign countries and unlimited high-speed 4G LTE mobile hotspot data in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. •In January 2017, we introduced the latest in our Un-carrier initiatives, Un-carrier Next, where monthly wireless service fees and taxes are included in the advertised monthly recurring charge for T-Mobile ONE. We also unveiled Kickback on T-Mobile ONE, where participating customers who use 2 GB or less of data in a month, will get an up to a $10 credit on their next month’s bill per qualifying line. In addition, we introduced the Un-contract for T-Mobile ONE with the first-ever price guarantee on an unlimited 4G LTE plan, which allows T-Mobile ONE customers to keep their price for service until they decide to change it.•Simple Choice plans, which were launched in 2013 as part of phase 1.0 of our Un-carrier initiatives, eliminated annual service contracts and simplified the lineup of consumer rate plans to one affordable plan for unlimited voice and messaging services with the option to add data services. On January 25, 2017, we streamlined our Simple Choice plan offerings to new customers into our T-Mobile ONE plan.Depending on their credit profile, customers are qualified either for postpaid or prepaid service. Our device options for customers on T-Mobile ONE, and previously on Simple Choice plans, include:•Depending on their credit profile, qualifying customers who purchase a device from us have the option of financing all or a portion of the purchase price at the time of sale over an installment period of up to 24 months using our Equipment Installment Plan (“EIP”). •In addition, qualifying customers who finance their initial device with an EIP can enroll in our JUMP!® program (“JUMP!”) to later upgrade their device. Upon a qualifying JUMP! upgrade, the customer’s remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade-in their used device at the time of upgrade in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new EIP.•In 2015, we introduced JUMP! On Demand. With JUMP! On Demand, a low monthly payment covers the cost of leasing a new device and gives qualified customers the freedom to exchange it for a new device up to three times in 12 months for no extra fee. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return their device in good working condition or purchase their device.Network Transformation UpdateWe continue to increase the depth, breadth and functionality of the nation’s densest LTE network by adding new spectrum to increase coverage, and re-farming existing spectrum and implementing new technology to augment capacity. Collectively, these network advancements help provide improved network performance and reliability for our customers.Spectrum GrowthWe provide mobile communication services utilizing mid-band spectrum licenses, such as Advanced Wireless Services (“AWS”) and Personal Communications Service (“PCS”), and low-band spectrum licenses utilizing our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum. •We owned or had agreements to own an average of 86 MHz of spectrum across the top 25 markets in the U.S. as of December 31, 2016, comprised of an average of 12 MHz in the 700 MHz band, 30 MHz in the 1900 MHz PCS band and 44 MHz in the AWS band. This is compared to an average of 85 MHz of spectrum across the top 25 markets in the U.S. as of December 31, 2015. 6Table of Contents•Over the last year, we have entered into and closed on various agreements for the acquisition and exchange of 700 MHz A-Block, AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. See Note 5 – Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In addition, we intend to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future Federal Communications Commissions (“FCC”) spectrum license auctions, including the broadcast incentive auction of low-band 600 MHz spectrum licenses that is currently in-progress.•We have continued to build out our network to concentrate our cell sites where our customers need data most. We had approximately 66,000 cell sites, including macro sites and distributed antenna system network nodes as of December 31, 2016, compared to approximately 64,000 cell sites as of December 31, 2015.•In 2015, we completed the shutdown of the MetroPCS Code Division Multiple Access (“CDMA”) network. The migration of customers from the MetroPCS CDMA network onto T-Mobile’s LTE and Evolved High Speed Packet Access Plus network provides faster network performance for MetroPCS customers with compatible handsets.Network Coverage Growth•We continue to expand our coverage breadth and currently provide 4G LTE coverage to 314 million people, up from zero 4G LTE coverage four years ago. We are targeting to provide 320 million people with 4G LTE coverage by year-end 2017.•We own 700 MHz A-Block spectrum covering 272 million people or approximately 84% of the U.S. population. The spectrum covers all of the top 10 market areas and 29 of the top 30 market areas in the U.S.•We have deployed our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum in over 500 market areas covering more than 252 million people under the name “Extended Range LTE.” We expect to continue to aggressively roll-out new 700 MHz market areas in 2017 including Chicago, Eastern Montana, and substantially all of the remaining population in 700 MHz licensed areas.Network Capacity GrowthWe continue to expand our capacity through the re-farming of existing spectrum and implementation of new technologies including Voice over LTE (""VoLTE""), Carrier Aggregation, 4x4 MIMO, and 256 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (""QAM"").•At the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, approximately 70% of spectrum was being used for 4G LTE compared to 52% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. We expect to continue to re-farm spectrum currently committed to 2G and 3G technologies.•Re-farmed spectrum enables us to continue expanding Wideband LTE, which currently covers 232 million people. Wideband LTE refers to markets that have bandwidth of at least 15+15 MHz dedicated to 4G LTE.•VoLTE currently comprises approximately 67% of total voice calls compared to 39% in December 2015. Moving voice traffic to VoLTE frees up spectrum and allows for the transition of spectrum currently used for 2G and 3G to 4G LTE. We are leading the U.S. wireless industry in terms of VoLTE migration.•Carrier aggregation is live for our customers in 674 cities. This advanced technology delivers superior speed and performance by bonding two or three discrete spectrum channels together. •4x4 MIMO is currently available in more than 300 cities. This technology effectively delivers twice the speed, and incremental network capacity, to customers by doubling the number of data paths between the cell site and a customer's device.•We have rolled out 256 QAM, which increases the number of bits delivered per transmission to enable faster speed.•Innovative programs like Binge On and T-Mobile ONE also create capacity by optimizing video for mobile viewing. These programs deliver material capacity benefits to both customers and our network. Since the launch of Binge On, our customers have watched more than 4 billion hours of optimized video.Network Speed LeadershipWe continue to have the fastest nationwide 4G LTE network in the U.S. based on both download and upload speeds from millions of user-generated tests. This is the twelfth consecutive quarter that we have led the industry in both download and upload speeds.7Table of ContentsDistributionWe had approximately 52,000 total points of distribution, including approximately 13,000 T-Mobile and MetroPCS branded locations and 39,000 third-party and national retailer locations, as well as distribution through our websites, as of December 31, 2016. Our distribution density in major metropolitan areas provides customers with the convenience of having retail and service locations close to where they live and work.CompetitionThe wireless telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We are the third largest provider of postpaid service plans and the largest provider of prepaid service plans in the U.S. as measured by customers. Our competitors include other national carriers, such as AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”), Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”) and Sprint Corporation. AT&T and Verizon are significantly larger than us and may enjoy greater resources and scale advantages as compared to us. In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller regional carriers, existing MVNOs, such as TracFone Wireless, Inc., and future MVNOs, such as Comcast Corporation and Charter Communications, Inc., many of which offer or plan to offer no-contract, prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice and messaging, using alternative technologies or services. Competitive factors within the wireless telecommunications industry include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies, availability of additional spectrum licenses and regulatory changes. Some competitors have shown a willingness to use aggressive pricing as a source of differentiation. Other competitors have sought to add ancillary services, like mobile video, to enhance their offerings. Taken together, the competitive factors we face continue to put pressure on margins as companies compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customers.EmployeesAs of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 50,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions.RegulationThe FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The FCC has a number of complex requirements and proceedings that affect our operations and that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection, and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly. Wireless communications providers must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10 years in the case of cellular, PCS and point-to-point microwave licenses. AWS licenses have an initial term of 15 years, with successive 10-year terms thereafter. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, Congress’ and the FCC’s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (“CMRS”), which includes cellular, PCS and specialized mobile radio, could significantly increase competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers’ spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers. 8Table of ContentsCongress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest albeit subject to review. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our company by Deutsche Telekom. This declaratory ruling, and our licenses, are conditioned on Deutsche Telekom’s and the Company’s compliance with a network security agreement with the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security. Failure to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation of our spectrum licenses.While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communication providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of devices while driving, zoning and land use. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other federal agencies have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are to some extent unknown and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.

Risk FactorsIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating T-Mobile. Our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results, as well as the price of our common stock and other securities, could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Risks Related to Our Business and the Wireless Industry The scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum, and regulations relating to spectrum use, may adversely affect our business strategy and financial performance. We will need to acquire additional spectrum in order to continue our customer growth, expand and deepen our coverage, maintain our quality of service, meet increasing customer demands and deploy new technologies. We will be at a competitive disadvantage and possibly experience erosion in the quality of service in certain markets if we fail to gain access to necessary spectrum before reaching capacity. As a result, we are actively seeking to make additional investment in spectrum, which could be significant. 9Table of ContentsThe continued interest in, and acquisition of, spectrum by existing carriers and others may reduce our ability to acquire and/or raise the cost of acquiring spectrum in the secondary market or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other means, including government auctions. We may need to enter into spectrum sharing or leasing arrangements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and may involve significant expenditures. Although the FCC is conducting an auction for low band spectrum, in which we are participating, gaining access to that spectrum may take up to three years or more. Any material delay could adversely impact our ability to implement our plans and efforts to improve our network. In addition, our return on investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customers and to provide additional services and usage to existing customers. As a result, the return on any investment in spectrum that we make may not be as much as we anticipate or take longer than expected. Additionally, we may be unable to secure the spectrum we need in any auction we may elect to participate in or in the secondary market, on favorable terms or at all. The FCC may impose conditions on the use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum, including new restrictions or rules governing the use or access to current or future spectrum. This could increase pressure on capacity. Additional conditions that may be imposed by the FCC include heightened build-out requirements, limited renewal rights, clearing obligations, or open access or net neutrality requirements that may make it less attractive or less economical to acquire spectrum. In addition, rules may be established for future government spectrum auctions that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas. If we cannot acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise, if competitors acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide services competitive with our services, or if we cannot deploy services over acquired spectrum on a timely basis without burdensome conditions, at reasonable cost, and while maintaining network quality levels, then our ability to attract and retain customers and our associated financial performance could be materially adversely affected. Competition, industry consolidation, and changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have multiple wireless competitors, some of which have greater resources than us and compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings; price; network coverage, speed and quality; and customer service. We expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry’s customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rates or possibly negative, leading to ongoing competition for customers. Customer churn may increase as the wireless industry shifts away from service contracts. We also expect that our customers’ appetite for data services will place increasing demands on our network capacity. This competition and our capacity will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers. Our ability to compete will depend on, among other things, continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality and customer services, effective marketing and selling of products and services, attractive pricing, and cost management, all of which will involve significant expenses. Joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances in the wireless sector have resulted in and are expected to result in larger competitors competing for a limited number of customers. The two largest national wireless communication providers currently serve a significant percentage of all wireless customers and hold significant spectrum and other resources. Our largest competitors may be able to enter into exclusive handset, device, or content arrangements, execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaigns, or otherwise improve their cost position relative to ours. In addition, refusal of our large competitors to provide critical access to resources and inputs, such as roaming services on reasonable terms, could improve their position within the wireless broadband mobile services industry. We are also facing competition from other service providers as industry sectors converge, such as telecom services and content; satellite, wireless, and fiber; and other service providers. Companies like Comcast and AT&T/DirecTV (and AT&T’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner) will have the scale and assets to aggressively compete in a converging industry. Verizon is also a significant competitor focusing on premium content offerings as well as acquisitions and proposed acquisitions like AOL and Yahoo to diversify outside of core wireless. Further, some of our competitors now provide content services in addition to voice and broadband services, and consumers are increasingly accessing video content from Internet-based providers and applications, all of which create increased competition in this area. These factors, together with the effects of the increasing aggregate penetration of wireless services in all metropolitan areas and the ability of our larger competitors to use resources to build out their networks and to quickly deploy advanced technologies, could make it more difficult for us to continue to attract and retain customers, and may adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 10Table of ContentsIf we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy. Significant technological changes continue to impact the communications industry. In general, these technological changes enhance communications and enable a broader array of companies to offer services competitive with ours. In order to grow and remain competitive with new and evolving technologies in our industry, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, continually invest in our network, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings to address our current and potential customers’ changing demands. Enhancing our network, such as deploying 5G, is subject to risk from equipment changes and migration of customers from existing spectrum bands and the potential inability to secure spectrum necessary to deploy advanced technologies. Adopting new and sophisticated technologies may result in implementation issues such as scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints, regulatory permitting issues, customer dissatisfaction, and other issues that could cause delays in launching new technological capabilities, which in turn could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the upgrades. In general, the development of new services in the wireless telecommunications industry will require us to anticipate and respond to the continuously changing demands of our customers, which we may not be able to do accurately or timely. We could experience a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and operating results if our new services fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with these services are higher than anticipated. We could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches, whether directly or by way of third parties. Our business, like that of most retailers and wireless companies, involves the receipt, storage, and transmission of confidential information, including sensitive personal information and payment card information, confidential information about our employees and suppliers, and other sensitive information about our company, such as our business plans, transactions and intellectual property (“confidential information”). Unauthorized access may be difficult to anticipate, detect, or prevent, particularly given that the methods of unauthorized access constantly change and evolve. We may experience unauthorized access or distribution of confidential information by third parties or employees, errors or breaches by third party suppliers, or other breaches of security that compromise the integrity of confidential information, and such breaches can have a materially adverse effect on our business or damage our reputation.In addition, cyber-attacks, such as denial of service and other malicious attacks, could disrupt our internal systems and applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers, and have other adverse effects on our business and that of others who depend on our services. As a telecommunications carrier, we are considered a critical infrastructure provider and therefore may be more likely to be the target of such attacks. Such attacks against companies may be perpetrated by a variety of groups or persons, including those in jurisdictions where U.S. law enforcement is or has been unable to effectively address such attacks. In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third-party service providers when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. We and our third-party service providers have been subject to unauthorized access to confidential information in the past, including a breach at one of our credit check providers in September 2015 in which a subset of records containing current and potential customer information was compromised by an external party. Although we regularly review our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and to defend against attacks seeking to disrupt our services, the ever-evolving threat landscape requires us to continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes. We cannot assure you that the preventive actions we take will be adequate to repel a significant attack or prevent information security breaches or the misuses of data, unauthorized access by third parties or employees, or exploits against third-party supplier environments. If we are subject to such attacks or compromise, we may incur significant costs, be subject to regulatory investigations, sanctions and private litigation, experience disruptions to our operations or suffer damage to our reputation. Although the cyber-attacks that we and our third-party service providers have been subjected to in the past have not caused significant harm to our company, future cyber-attacks may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. System failures and business disruptions may allow unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other systems which could be materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition. To be successful, we must provide our customers with reliable, trustworthy service and protect the communications, location, and personal information shared or generated by our customers. We rely upon both our systems and networks and the systems and networks of other providers and suppliers to provide and support our services and, in some cases, protect our customers’ and our information. Failure of our or others’ systems, networks, or infrastructure may prevent us from providing reliable service or may allow for the unauthorized use of or interference with our networks and other systems or for the compromise of 11Table of Contentscustomer information. Examples of these risks include:•human error such as responding to deceptive communications or unintentionally executing malicious code;•physical damage, power surges or outages, or equipment failure, including those as a result of severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and acts of war;•theft of customer and/or proprietary information offered for sale for competitive advantage or corporate extortion; •unauthorized access to our IT and business systems or to our network and critical infrastructure and those of our suppliers and other providers; •supplier failures or delays; and •system failures or outages of our business systems or communications network. Such events could cause us to lose customers, lose revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational and goodwill damages, and subject us to litigation or governmental investigation. Remediation costs could include liability for information loss, repairing infrastructure and systems, and/or costs of incentives offered to customers. Our insurance may not cover, or be adequate to fully reimburse us for, costs and losses associated with such events. We are in the process of implementing a new billing system, which will support a portion of our subscribers, while maintaining our legacy billing system. Any unanticipated difficulties, disruption, or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial, and reputational effects on our business. We are currently implementing a new customer billing system, which involves a new third-party supported platform and utilization of a phased deployment approach. Post implementation, we plan to operate both the existing and new billing systems in parallel to aid in the transition to the new system until all phases of the conversion are complete. The implementation may cause major system or business disruptions, or we may fail to implement the new billing system in a timely or effective manner. In addition, the third-party billing services supporting vendor may experience errors, cyber-attacks, or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact us and over which we may have limited control. Interruptions and/or failure of this new billing services system could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to provide or bill for our services, retain customers, attract new customers, or negatively impact overall customer experience. Any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and reputational damage.We rely on third parties to provide products or services for the operation of our business, and a failure or inability by such parties to provide these products or services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We depend heavily on suppliers, their subcontractors, and other third parties in order for us to efficiently operate our business. Our business is complex, and it is not unusual for multiple vendors located in multiple locations to help us to develop, maintain, and troubleshoot products and services, such as network components, software development services, and billing and customer service support. Our suppliers may provide services outside of the United States, which carries associated additional regulatory and legal obligations. We generally rely upon the suppliers to provide contractual assurances and accurate information regarding risks associated with their provision of products or services in accordance with our expectations and standards such as our supplier code of conduct and our third party-risk management standard, and they may fail to do so. Generally, there are multiple sources for the types of products and services we purchase or use. However, we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for billing services, voice and data communications transport services, network infrastructure, equipment, handsets, other devices, and payment processing services, among other products and services. Disruptions or failure of such suppliers to adequately perform could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial performance. In the past, our suppliers, contractors and third-party retailers may not have always performed at the levels we expected or at the levels required by their contracts. Our business could be severely disrupted if key suppliers, contractors, service providers, or third-party retailers fail to comply with their contracts or become unable to continue the supply due to patent or other intellectual property infringement actions or other disruptions. Our business could also be disrupted if we experience delays or service degradation during any transition to a new outsourcing provider or other supplier or we were required to replace the supplied products or services with those from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.12Table of ContentsEconomic, political, and market conditions may adversely affect our business and financial performance, as well as our access to financing on favorable terms or at all. Our business and financial performance are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, rates of inflation (or concerns about deflation), unemployment rates, economic growth, energy costs, and other macro-economic factors. Difficult, or worsening, general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Market volatility, political and economic uncertainty, and weak economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and financial performance in a number of ways. Our services are available to a broad customer base, a significant segment of which may be more vulnerable to weak economic conditions. We may have greater difficulty in gaining new customers within this segment, and existing customers may be more likely to terminate service due to an inability to pay. Weak economic conditions and credit conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers and dealers, some of which have filed for or may be considering bankruptcy, or may experience cash flow or liquidity problems, or are unable to obtain or refinance credit such that they may no longer be able to operate. Any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market, or sell our products and services. In addition, instability in the global financial markets could lead to periodic volatility in the credit, equity, and fixed income markets. This volatility could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financing arrangements include restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility. The agreements governing our indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions, and incurrence-based ratio tests, may limit our or our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in some transactions, including the following:•incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock;•paying dividends, redeeming capital stock, or making other restricted payments or investments;•selling or buying assets, properties, or licenses, including participating in future FCC auctions of spectrum or private sales of spectrum;•developing assets, properties, or licenses that we have or in the future may procure;•creating liens on assets;•engaging in mergers, acquisitions, business combinations, or other transactions;•entering into transactions with affiliates; and•placing restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments. These restrictions could limit our ability to react to changes in our operating environment or the economy. Any future indebtedness that we incur may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our debt agreements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these agreements and other agreements, giving our lenders the right to terminate any commitments they had made to provide us with further funds and to require us to repay all amounts then outstanding. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our ability to make payments on our debt, to repay our existing indebtedness when due, and to fund our capital intensive business and operations, and significant planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is in turn subject to the operational risks described elsewhere in this report. Our debt service obligations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and operating results, including by:•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the communications industry or pursuing growth opportunities;•reducing the amount of cash available for other operational or strategic needs; and13Table of Contents•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors who are less leveraged than we are. Some of our debt also has a floating rate of interest linked to various indices. If the resets or the change in indices result in interest rate increases, debt service requirements will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. While we have and may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates in the future, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk, and any portion not subject to such agreements would have full exposure to higher interest rates. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could result in a loss of investor confidence regarding our financial statements or may have a material adverse effect on our business. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we along with our independently registered public accounting firm are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We rely heavily on IT systems as an important part of our internal controls in order to operate, transact, and otherwise manage our business, as well as provide effective and timely reporting of our financial results. Failure to design and maintain effective internal controls, including those over our IT systems, could constitute a material weakness that could result in inaccurate financial statements, inaccurate disclosures, or failure to prevent fraud. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm were unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls, investor confidence regarding our financial statements and our business could be materially adversely affected. Our financial performance will be impaired if we experience high fraud rates related to device financing, credit cards, dealers, or subscriptions. Our operating costs could increase substantially as a result of fraud, including device financing, customer credit card, subscription, or dealer fraud. If our fraud detection strategies and processes are not successful in detecting and controlling fraud, whether directly or by way of the systems, processes, and operations of third parties such as national retailers, dealers, and others, the resulting loss of revenue or increased expenses could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. We rely on highly-skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly-skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, changes to U.S. immigration policy, competitors’ hiring practices, employee tolerance for the significant amount of change within and demands on our company and our industry, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain and motivate our existing employees and to attract new employees. If we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employees and attracting new key personnel, we may not be able to meet our business plan and, as a result, our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected. Any acquisition, investment, or merger may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business.We may pursue acquisitions of, investments in or mergers with businesses, technologies, services and/or products that complement or expand our business. Some of these potential transactions could be significant relative to the size of our business and operations. Any such transaction would involve a number of risks and could present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:•diversion of management attention from running our existing business;•increased costs to integrate the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the business involved in any such transaction with our business;•difficulties in effectively integrating the financial and operational reporting systems of the business involved in any such transaction into (or supplanting such systems with) our financial and operational reporting infrastructure and internal control framework in an effective and timely manner;•potential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process or as a result of any litigation arising in connection with any such transaction;•significant transaction expenses in connection with any such transaction, whether consummated or not;14Table of Contents•risks related to our ability to obtain any required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate any such transaction;•acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and any such financing could significantly increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings; and•any business, technology, service, or product involved in any such transaction may significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from our transaction, which could, among other things, also result in a write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with such transaction.For any or all of these reasons, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment, or merger may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Risks related to Legal and Regulatory Matters Changes in regulations or in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or operating results. The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale, and interconnection of wireless communications systems, as do some state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. Additionally, the FTC and other federal agencies have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection, and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of wireless products and services. We are subject to regulatory oversight by various federal, state and local agencies, as well as judicial review and actions, on issues related to the wireless industry that include, but are not limited to: roaming, spectrum allocation and licensing, facilities siting, pole attachments, intercarrier compensation, Universal Service Fund (“USF”), net neutrality, special access, 911 services, consumer protection, consumer privacy, and cybersecurity. We are also subject to regulations in connection with other aspects of our business, including handset financing and insurance activities. We cannot assure you that the FCC or any other federal, state or local agencies will not adopt regulations or take other enforcement or other actions that would adversely affect our business, impose new costs, or require changes in current or planned operations. For example, in June 2015, the FCC’s new net neutrality rules became effective, with the exception of enhanced transparency requirements, a portion of which became effective January 2017. In 2016, the FCC also adopted a new broadband privacy regime that applies to our operations. Both sets of rules potentially subject some of our initiatives and practices to more burdensome requirements and heightened scrutiny by federal and state regulators, the public, edge providers, and private litigants regarding whether such initiatives or practices are compliant. In addition, states are increasingly focused on the quality of service and support that wireless communication providers provide to their customers and several states have proposed or enacted new and potentially burdensome regulations in this area. We also face potential investigations by, and inquiries from or actions by state Public Utility Commissions. We also cannot assure you that Congress will not amend the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority and which serves to limit state authority, or enact other legislation in a manner that could be adverse to our business. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We could be subject to fines, forfeitures, and other penalties (including, in extreme cases, revocation of our spectrum licenses) for failure to comply with FCC or other governmental regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Unfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and financial condition. We are regularly involved in a number of legal proceedings before various state and federal courts, the FCC, the FTC, other federal agencies, and state and local regulatory agencies, including state attorneys general. Such legal proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel. The assessment of the outcome of legal proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or pursuant to final judgment, order or decree may differ materially from amounts accrued in our financial statements. In addition, litigation or similar proceedings could impose restraints on our current or future manner of doing business. Such potential outcomes including judgments, awards, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or ability to do business. 15Table of ContentsWe offer highly regulated financial services products. These products expose us to a wide variety of state and federal regulations. The financing of devices, including through our EIP and JUMP! On Demand programs, has expanded our regulatory compliance obligations. If we fail to remain compliant with any of these regulations, then we face the risk of:•increased consumer complaints and potential examinations or enforcement actions by federal and state regulatory agencies, including but not limited to the Consumer Financial Protection Board, the FCC and the FTC; •violation of financial services and consumer protections regulations may result in regulatory fines, penalties, enforcement actions, civil litigation, and/or class action lawsuits.Failure to comply with applicable regulations and the realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which offer only limited protection. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary rights. We may not have the ability in certain jurisdictions to adequately protect intellectual property rights. Moreover, others may independently develop processes and technologies that are competitive to ours. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. We cannot be sure that any legal actions against such infringers will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. We cannot assure you that our pending or future patent applications will be granted or enforceable, or that the rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide us with any competitive advantages. In addition, we cannot assure you that any trademark or service mark registrations will be issued with respect to pending or future applications or will provide adequate protection of our brands. We do not have insurance coverage for intellectual property losses, and as such, a charge for an anticipated settlement or an adverse ruling awarding damages represents unplanned loss events. Any of these factors could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. We are a defendant in numerous intellectual property lawsuits, including patent infringement lawsuits, which exposes us to the risk of adverse financial impact either by way of significant settlement amounts or damage awards. As we adopt new technologies and new business systems, and provide customers with new products and/or services, we may face additional infringement claims. These claims could require us to cease certain activities or to cease selling relevant products and services. These claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend, and divert management resources, and expose us to significant damages awards or settlements, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. In addition to litigation directly involving our company, our vendors and suppliers can be threatened with patent litigation and/or subjected to the threat of disruption or blockage of sale, use, or importation of products, posing the risk of supply chain interruption to particular products and associated services exposing us to material adverse operational and financial impacts. Our business may be impacted by new or changing tax laws or regulations and actions by federal, state, and/or local agencies, or how judicial authorities apply tax laws. In connection with the products and services we sell, we calculate, collect, and remit various federal, state, and local taxes, surcharges and regulatory fees (“tax” or “taxes”) to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including federal USF contributions and common carrier regulatory fees. In addition, we incur and pay state and local taxes and fees on purchases of goods and services used in our business. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In many cases, the application of tax laws are uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services, such as broadband internet access and cloud related services. Changes in tax laws could impact revenue on tax inclusive plans.In the event that we have incorrectly described, disclosed, calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts that were due to governmental authorities, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions, which could materially impact our operations or financial condition. In the event that federal, state, and/or local municipalities were to 16Table of Contentssignificantly increase taxes on our network, operations, or services, or seek to impose new taxes, it could have a material adverse effect on our margins and financial and operational results. Our wireless licenses are subject to renewal and may be revoked in the event that we violate applicable laws. Our existing wireless licenses are subject to renewal upon the expiration of the 10-year or 15-year period for which they are granted. Historically, the FCC has approved our license renewal applications. However, the Communications Act provides that licenses may be revoked for cause and license renewal applications denied if the FCC determines that a renewal would not serve the public interest. In addition, our licenses are subject to our compliance with the terms set forth in the agreement pertaining to national security among Deutsche Telekom, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and the Company. The failure of Deutsche Telekom or the Company to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation or non-renewal of our spectrum licenses. If we fail to timely file to renew any wireless license or fail to meet any regulatory requirements for renewal, including construction and substantial service requirements, we could be denied a license renewal. Many of our wireless licenses are subject to interim or final construction requirements and there is no guarantee that the FCC will find our construction, or the construction of prior licensees, sufficient to meet the build-out or renewal requirements. The FCC has pending a rulemaking proceeding to reevaluate, among other things, its wireless license renewal showings and standards and may in this or other proceedings promulgate changes or additional substantial requirements or conditions to its renewal rules, including revising license build out requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the FCC will renew our wireless licenses upon their expiration. If any of our wireless licenses were to be revoked or not renewed upon expiration, we would not be permitted to provide services under that license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our business could be adversely affected by findings of product liability for health/safety risks from wireless devices and transmission equipment, as well as by changes to regulations/radio frequency emission standards. We do not manufacture the devices or other equipment that we sell, and we depend on our suppliers to provide defect-free and safe equipment. Suppliers are required by applicable law to manufacture their devices to meet certain governmentally imposed safety criteria. However, even if the devices we sell meet the regulatory safety criteria, we could be held liable with the equipment manufacturers and suppliers for any harm caused by products we sell if such products are later found to have design or manufacturing defects. We generally seek to enter into indemnification agreements with the manufacturers who supply us with devices to protect us from losses associated with product liability, but we cannot guarantee that we will be fully protected against all losses associated with a product that is found to be defective. Allegations have been made that the use of wireless handsets and wireless transmission equipment, such as cell towers, may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer and brain tumors. Lawsuits have been filed against manufacturers and carriers in the industry claiming damages for alleged health problems arising from the use of wireless handsets. In addition, the FCC has from time to time gathered data regarding wireless handset emissions and its assessment of this issue may evolve based on its findings. The media has also reported incidents of handset battery malfunction, including reports of batteries that have overheated. These allegations may lead to changes in regulatory standards. There have also been other allegations regarding wireless technology, including allegations that wireless handset emissions may interfere with various electronic medical devices (including hearing aids and pacemakers), airbags and anti-lock brakes. Defects in the products of our suppliers, such the recent recalls by a handset Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) on one of its smartphone devices, could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Additionally, there are safety risks associated with the use of wireless devices while operating vehicles or equipment. Concerns over any of these risks and the effect of any legislation, rules or regulations that have been and may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to sell our wireless services. Related to Ownership of our Common Stock We are controlled by Deutsche Telekom, whose interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. Deutsche Telekom beneficially owns and possesses majority voting power of the fully diluted shares of our common stock. Through its control of the voting power of our common stock and the rights granted to Deutsche Telekom in our certificate of incorporation and the Stockholder’s Agreement, Deutsche Telekom controls the election of our directors and all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. By virtue of Deutsche Telekom’s voting control, we are a “controlled company,” as defined in the NASDAQ listing rules, and are not subject to NASDAQ requirements that would otherwise require us to have a 17Table of Contentsmajority of independent directors, a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors. Accordingly, our stockholders will not be afforded the same protections generally as stockholders of other NASDAQ-listed companies with respect to corporate governance for so long as we rely on these exemptions from the corporate governance requirements. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and the Stockholder’s Agreement restrict us from taking certain actions without Deutsche Telekom’s prior written consent as long as Deutsche Telekom beneficially owns 30% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including:•the incurrence of debt (excluding certain permitted debt) if our consolidated ratio of debt to cash flow for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available would exceed 5.25 to 1.0 on a pro forma basis; •the acquisition of any business, debt or equity interests, operations or assets of any person for consideration in excess of $1 billion; •the sale of any of our or our subsidiaries’ divisions, businesses, operations or equity interests for consideration in excess of $1 billion; •any change in the size of our board of directors; •the issuances of equity securities in excess of 10% of our outstanding shares or to repurchase debt held by Deutsche Telekom; •the repurchase or redemption of equity securities or the declaration of extraordinary or in-kind dividends or distributions other than on a pro rata basis; or•the termination or hiring of our chief executive officer. These restrictions could prevent us from taking actions that our board of directors may otherwise determine are in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders or that may be in the best interests of our other stockholders. Deutsche Telekom effectively has control over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, changes to our certificate of incorporation, a sale or merger of our company and other transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law. Deutsche Telekom’s controlling interest may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, the Company. Deutsche Telekom may have strategic, financial, or other interests different from our other stockholders, including as the holder of a substantial amount of our indebtedness and as the counter-party in a number of commercial arrangements, and may make decisions adverse to the interests of our other stakeholders. Future sales or issuances of our common stock, including sales by Deutsche Telekom, could have a negative impact on our stock price. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares or the availability of shares of our common stock will have on the prevailing trading price of our common stock from time to time. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline and could result in dilution of your shares. We and Deutsche Telekom are parties to the Stockholder’s Agreement pursuant to which Deutsche Telekom is free to transfer its shares in public sales without notice, as long as such transactions would not result in the transferee owning 30% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If a transfer would exceed the 30% threshold, it is prohibited unless the transferee makes a binding offer to purchase all of the other outstanding shares on the same price and terms. The Stockholder’s Agreement does not otherwise impose any other restrictions on the sales of common stock by Deutsche Telekom. Moreover, we have filed a shelf registration statement with respect to the common stock and certain debt securities held by Deutsche Telekom, which would facilitate the resale by Deutsche Telekom of all or any portion of the shares of our common stock it holds. The sale of shares of our common stock by Deutsche Telekom (other than in transactions involving the purchase of all of our outstanding shares) could significantly increase the number of shares available in the market, which could cause a decrease in our stock price. In addition, even if Deutsche Telekom does not sell a large number of its shares into the market, its right to transfer a large number of shares into the market may depress our stock price. In addition, we have reserved up to 38.684 million shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion of our preferred stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. The dividends on the preferred stock may also be paid in cash or, subject to certain limitations, shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock. The issuance of additional shares of common stock upon conversion of, or in connection with the payment of dividends upon, the mandatory 18Table of Contentsconvertible preferred stock may depress our stock price. Our stock price may be volatile, and may fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results. The trading prices of the securities of communications companies historically have been highly volatile, and the trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations. Our stock price may fluctuate in reaction to a number of events and factors that may include, among other things:•our or our competitors’ actual or anticipated operating and financial results; introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors or changes in service plans or pricing by us or our competitors; •analyst projections, predictions and forecasts, analyst target prices for our securities and changes in, or our failure to meet, securities analysts’ expectations; •transaction in our common stock by major investors;•Deutsche Telekom’s financial performance, results of operation, or actions implied or taken by Deutsche Telekom; •entry of new competitors into our markets or perceptions of increased price competition, including a price war; •our performance, including subscriber growth, and our financial and operational metric performance;•market perceptions relating to our services, network, handsets, and deployment of our LTE platform and our access to iconic handsets, services, applications, or content;•market perceptions of the wireless communications industry and valuation models for us and the industry;•conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry sectors we operate in;•changes in our credit rating or future prospects;•changes in interest rates;•changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;•the availability or perceived availability of additional capital in general and our access to such capital;•actual or anticipated consolidation, or other strategic mergers or acquisition activities involving us or our competitors, or other participants in related or adjacent industries, or market speculations regarding such activities;•disruptions of our operations or service providers or other vendors necessary to our network operations; •the general state of the U.S. and world politics and economies, including changes in interest rates; and•availability of additional spectrum, whether by the announcement, commencement, bidding and closing of auctions for new spectrum or the acquisition of companies that own spectrum, and the extent to which we or our competitors succeed in acquiring additional spectrum. In addition, the stock market has been volatile in the recent past and has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which may continue for the foreseeable future. This volatility has had a significant impact on the trading price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in the communications industry. These changes frequently occur irrespective of the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the trading price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results. We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our credit facilities and the indentures and supplemental indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. In addition, no dividend may be declared or paid on our common stock, other than dividends payable solely in Shares of our common stock, unless all accrued dividends for all completed dividend periods have been declared and paid on our preferred stock. Other than to pay dividends on our preferred stock, we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to invest in our business. Our stockholder rights plan could prevent a change in control of our Company in instances in which some stockholders may believe a change in control is in their best interests. We have a stockholder rights plan (“Rights Plan”) in effect that will expire in March 2017, unless renewed. The Rights Plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire our company on terms that our board of directors 19Table of Contentsdoes not believe are in our and our stockholders’ best interest. The Rights Plan is intended to protect stockholders in the event of an unfair or coercive offer to acquire the Company and to provide our board of directors with adequate time to evaluate unsolicited offers. The Rights Plan may prevent or make takeovers or unsolicited corporate transactions with respect to our company more difficult, even if stockholders may consider such transactions favorable, possibly including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.Item 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewThe objectives of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) are to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with the following:•A narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results;•Context to the financial statements; and•Information that allows assessment of the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance. Our MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our audited consolidated financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2016 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our MD&A are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.Business OverviewWe introduced our Un-carrier strategy in 2013 with the objective of eliminating customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry. Since that time, we have continued our efforts with the launch of additional initiatives of our Un-carrier strategy. During 2016, we launched the following Un-carrier initiatives:•In June 2016, we introduced #GetThanked, a history-making move dedicated exclusively to saying “thank you” to our customers. This program, offered to our customers as part of their T-Mobile service: (i) offers eligible new (through December 31, 2016) or existing (as of June 6, 2016) customers ownership in the Company with a free share of T-23Table of ContentsMobile stock or an additional share of T-Mobile stock for every new active account each customer refers through December 31, 2016, subject to a maximum of 100 shares in a calendar year, (ii) enables eligible customers who download the T-Mobile Tuesday app to be informed about and to redeem products and services offered by participating business partners each Tuesday and (iii) offers eligible customers a full hour of free in-flight Wi-Fi on their smartphone on all Gogo-equipped domestic flights. •In September 2016, we introduced our T-Mobile ONE plan, a move that gives our customers unlimited calls, unlimited text and unlimited high-speed 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) data. On T-Mobile ONE, video typically streams at DVD (480p) quality and tethering is at maximum 3G speeds. Customers can choose to add on additional features to T-Mobile ONE for an additional cost. On T-Mobile ONE Plus customers also receive unlimited High Definition Video Day Passes, Voicemail to Text, NameID, unlimited Gogo in-flight internet passes on capable domestic flights and up to two times faster speeds when traveling abroad in 140+ countries and destinations. On T-Mobile ONE Plus International, customers receive the benefits of T-Mobile ONE Plus as well as free and reduced calling from the U.S. to foreign countries and unlimited high-speed 4G LTE mobile hotspot data.•In January 2017, we introduced, Un-carrier Next, where monthly wireless service fees and all taxes are included in the advertised monthly recurring charge for T-Mobile ONE. We also unveiled Kickback on T-Mobile ONE, where participating customers who use 2 GB or less of data in a month, will get up to a $10 credit on their next month’s bill per qualifying line. In addition, we introduced the Un-contract for T-Mobile ONE with the first-ever price guarantee on an unlimited 4G LTE plan which allows T-Mobile ONE customers to keep their price for service until they decide to change it.Our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues and we believe our Un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved branded postpaid phone and branded prepaid customer churn.

Upon the sale, the MVNO Transaction resulted in a transfer of 1,365,000 branded postpaid phone customers and 326,000 branded prepaid customers to wholesale customers. Prospectively from September 1, 2016, revenue for these customers is recorded within wholesale revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Additionally, the impact of the MVNO Transaction resulted in improvements to branded postpaid phone churn for year ended December 31, 2016.During the year ended December 31, 2016, a handset OEM announced recalls on certain of its smartphone devices. As a result, we recorded no revenue associated with the device sales to customers and impaired the devices to their net realizable value. The OEM has agreed to reimburse T-Mobile for direct and indirect costs associated with the recall, as such, we have recorded an amount due from the OEM as an offset to the loss recorded in Cost of equipment sales and the costs incurred within Selling, general and administrative in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and a reduction to Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.24Table of ContentsResults of Operations2016 Highlights•Total revenues increased $5.2 billion, or 16%, to $37.2 billion in 2016 primarily driven by growth in service and equipment revenues as further discussed below. The MVNO Transaction shifted Branded postpaid revenues to Wholesale revenues, but did not materially impact total revenues.•Service revenues increased $3.0 billion, or 12%, to $27.8 billion in 2016 primarily due to growth in our average branded customer base as a result of strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and the success of our MetroPCS brand and continued growth in new markets.•Equipment revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 30%, to $8.7 billion in 2016 primarily as a result of higher lease revenues, which are recognized over the lease term, resulting from the launch of our JUMP! On Demand program at the end of the second quarter of 2015, an increase in the number of devices sold and a higher average revenue per device sold.•Operating income increased $1.7 billion, or 84%, to $3.8 billion in 2016 primarily due to higher total revenues as well as increased gains on disposals of spectrum licenses, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization from an increase in the number of devices leased under our JUMP! On Demand Program, higher costs of equipment sales primarily from an increase in the number of devices sold and a higher average cost per device and higher Selling, general and administrative expenses to support customer growth and retention. •Net income increased $727 million, or 99%, to $1.5 billion in 2016 primarily due to higher operating income driven by the factors described above, partially offset by higher interest expense related to higher average debt and higher income tax expense. Additionally, 2016 included $509 million of net, after-tax gains on disposal of spectrum licenses compared to $100 million in 2015.•Adjusted EBITDA increased $3.0 billion, or 41%, to $10.4 billion in 2016 primarily from higher service revenues and gains on disposal of spectrum licenses, partially offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses to support customer growth. Lower losses on equipment in 2016 primarily due to an increase in lease revenues resulting from the launch of our JUMP! On Demand program at the end of the second quarter of 2015. Revenues associated with leased devices are recognized over the lease term.•Net cash provided by operating activities increased $721 million, or 13%, to $6.1 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net non-cash income and expenses included in Net income primarily due to changes in Depreciation and Amortization, Deferred income tax expense and Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses expense, as well as an increase in Net income. The increase was partially offset by an increase in net cash outflows from changes in working capital.•Free Cash Flow increased $743 million, or 108%, to $1.4 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily from higher net cash provided by operating activities as discussed above. Cash purchases of property and equipment includes capitalized interest of $142 million and $246 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.25Table of ContentsSet forth below is a summary of our consolidated results: Year Ended December 31, 2016 Versus 2015 2015 Versus 2014(in millions)2016 2015 2014$ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeRevenues Branded postpaid revenues$18,138 $16,383 $14,392 $1,755 11 % $1,991 14 %Branded prepaid revenues8,553 7,553 6,986 1,000 13 % 567 8 %Wholesale revenues903 692 731 211 30 % (39) (5)%Roaming and other service revenues250 193 266 57 30 % (73) (27)%Total service revenues27,844 24,821 22,375 3,023 12 % 2,446 11 %Equipment revenues8,727 6,718 6,789 2,009 30 % (71) (1)%Other revenues671 514 400 157 31 % 114 29 %Total revenues37,242 32,053 29,564 5,189 16 % 2,489 8 %Operating expenses Cost of services, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below5,731 5,554 5,788 177 3 % (234) (4)%Cost of equipment sales10,819 9,344 9,621 1,475 16 % (277) (3)%Selling, general and administrative11,378 10,189 8,863 1,189 12 % 1,326 15 %Depreciation and amortization6,243 4,688 4,412 1,555 33 % 276 6 %Cost of MetroPCS business combination104 376 299 (272) (72)% 77 26 %Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses(835) (163) (840) (672) NM 677 (81)%Other, net— — 5 — NM (5) NMTotal operating expenses33,440 29,988 28,148 3,452 12 % 1,840 7 %Operating income3,802 2,065 1,416 1,737 84 % 649 46 %Other income (expense) Interest expense(1,418) (1,085) (1,073) (333) 31 % (12) 1 %Interest expense to affiliates(312) (411) (278) 99 (24)% (133) 48 %Interest income261 420 359 (159) (38)% 61 17 %Other expense, net(6) (11) (11) 5 (45)% — — %Total other expense, net(1,475) (1,087) (1,003) (388) 36 % (84) 8 %Income before income taxes2,327 978 413 1,349 138 % 565 137 %Income tax expense(867) (245) (166) (622) 254 % (79) 48 %Net income$1,460 $733 $247 $727 99 % $486 197 % Net cash provided by operating activities$6,135 $5,414 $4,146 $721 13 % $1,268 31 %Net cash used in investing activities(5,680) (9,560) (7,246) 3,880 (41)% (2,314) 32 %Net cash provided by financing activities463 3,413 2,524 (2,950) (86)% 889 35 % Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA$10,391 $7,393 $5,636 $2,998 41 % $1,757 31 %Free Cash Flow1,433 690 (171) 743 108 % 861 (504)%NM - Not MeaningfulComparing 2016 Results with 2015 ResultsTotal revenues increased $5.2 billion or 16% primarily due to:Branded postpaid revenues increased $1.8 billion or 11% primarily from:•A 13% increase in the number of average branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers, driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices;•Higher device insurance program revenues primarily from customer growth; and•Higher regulatory program revenues; partially offset by•An increase in the non-cash net revenue deferral for Data Stash; and •The impact of reduced Branded postpaid revenues resulting from the MVNO Transaction.26Table of ContentsBranded prepaid revenues increased $1.0 billion or 13% primarily from:•A 13% increase in the number of average branded prepaid customers driven by the success of our MetroPCS brand; and•Continued growth in new markets.Wholesale revenues increased $211 million or 30% primarily from:•The impact of the increased Wholesale revenues resulting from the MVNO Transaction;•Growth in customers of certain MVNO partners; and •An increase in data usage per customer.Roaming and other service revenues increased $57 million or 30% primarily due to higher international roaming revenues driven by an increase in inbound roaming volumes.Equipment revenues increased $2.0 billion or 30% primarily from:•An increase of $1.2 billion in lease revenues resulting from the launch of our JUMP! On Demand program at the end of the second quarter of 2015. Revenues associated with leased devices are recognized over the lease term.•An increase of $570 million in device sales revenues, primarily due to a 9% increase in the number of devices sold. Device sales revenue is recognized at the time of sale.Gross EIP device financing to our customers increased by $923 million to $6.1 billion primarily due to an increase in devices financed due to our focus on EIP sales in 2016, compared to focus on devices financed on JUMP! On Demand after the launch of the program at the end of the second quarter of 2015.Other revenues increased $157 million or 31% primarily from:•Higher revenue from revenue share agreements with third parties; and•An increase in co-location rental income from leasing space on wireless communication towers to third parties. Our operating expenses consist of the following categories:•Cost of services consists primarily of costs directly attributable to providing wireless service through the operation of our network, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, network access and transport costs, utilities, maintenance, associated labor costs, long distance costs, regulatory program costs, roaming fees paid to other carriers and data content costs.•Cost of equipment sales consists primarily of costs of devices and accessories sold to customers and dealers, device costs to fulfill insurance and warranty claims, costs related to returned and purchased leased devices, write-downs of inventory related to shrinkage and obsolescence, and shipping and handling costs.•Selling, general and administrative consists of costs not directly attributable to providing wireless service for the operation of sales, customer care and corporate activities. These include commissions paid to dealers and retail employees for activations and upgrades, labor and facilities costs associated with retail sales force and administrative space, marketing and promotional costs, customer support and billing, bad debt expense, losses from sales of receivables and back office administrative support activities.Operating expenses increased $3.5 billion or 12% primarily due to:Cost of services increased $177 million or 3% primarily from:•Higher regulatory program costs and expenses associated with network expansion and the build-out of our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses, including higher employee-related costs; partially offset by •Lower long distance and toll costs; and•Synergies realized from the decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network.27Table of ContentsCost of equipment sales increased $1.5 billion or 16% primarily from:•A 9% increase in the number of devices sold; and•An increase in the impact from returned and purchased leased devices.Under our JUMP! On Demand program, the cost of the leased wireless device is capitalized and recognized as depreciation expense over the term of the lease rather than recognized as cost of equipment sales when the device is delivered to the customer. Additionally, upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. Returned devices transferred from Property and equipment, net are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write-down to market recognized as Cost of equipment sales.Selling, general and administrative increased $1.2 billion or 12% primarily from strategic investments to support our growing customer base including higher:•Employee-related costs;•Commissions driven by an increase in branded customer additions; and •Promotional costs.Depreciation and amortization increased $1.6 billion or 33% primarily from:•$1.5 billion in depreciation expense related to devices leased under our JUMP! On Demand program launched at the end of the second quarter of 2015. Under our JUMP! On Demand program, the cost of a leased wireless device is depreciated over the lease term to its estimated residual value. The total number of devices under lease was higher year-over-year, resulting in higher depreciation expense; and •The continued build-out of our 4G LTE network.Cost of MetroPCS business combination decreased $272 million or 72% primarily from lower network decommissioning costs. In 2014, we began decommissioning the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant network cell sites as part of the business combination. On July 1, 2015, we officially completed the shutdown of the MetroPCS CDMA network. Network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. Although we expect to incur additional network decommissioning costs in 2017, these costs are not expected to be significant.Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses increased $672 million primarily from a $636 million gain from a spectrum license transaction with AT&T recorded in the first quarter of 2016 and $199 million from other transactions in 2016, compared to $163 million in 2015.

Wholesale revenues decreased $39 million or 5% primarily from:•Revised agreements with certain MVNO partners in 2015; partially offset by •Growth in customers of certain MVNO partners.Roaming and other service revenues decreased $73 million or 27% primarily from:•Lower international roaming revenues driven by changes in contractual arrangements with certain roaming partners; and•A reduction in early termination fees.Equipment revenues decreased $71 million or 1% primarily from:•Lower average revenue per device sold, due in part to the impact of customers shifting to leasing higher-end devices under our JUMP! On Demand program; partially offset by•Growth in the number of devices and accessories sold.With JUMP! On Demand, revenues associated with leased wireless devices are recognized over the term of the lease rather than when the device is delivered to the customer. Despite the increase in the number of devices leased in 2015 following the launch of JUMP! On Demand, the unit volume of device sales increased 5% in 2015, compared to 2014.We financed $5.2 billion of devices through EIP during 2015, a decrease from $5.8 billion in 2014, primarily due to a decline in devices financed through EIP as customers increasingly shifted to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand.Other revenues increased $114 million or 29% primarily attributable to higher non-service revenues from revenue share agreements with third parties.Operating expenses increased $1.8 billion or 7% primarily due to:Cost of services decreased $234 million or 4% primarily from:•Synergies realized from the decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network; •Lower lease expense associated with spectrum license lease agreements; and •A reduction in certain regulatory program costs; partially offset by •Increases related to our network expansion and build-out of our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum.30Table of ContentsCost of equipment sales decreased $277 million or 3% primarily from:•Lower average cost per device sold, mainly due to the impact of customers shifting to leasing higher-end devices with JUMP!

On Demand, the unit volume of device sales increased 5% in 2015, compared to 2014.Selling, general and administrative increased $1.3 billion or 15% primarily from supporting the growing customer base, which also increased 15% and reflects increases in:•Employee-related costs;•Promotional costs; •Commissions; and•Bad debt expense and losses from sales of receivables primarily resulting from growth in the customer base and in the EIP program.Depreciation and amortization increased $276 million or 6% primarily from $312 million in depreciation expense related to devices leased under our JUMP! On Demand program launched at the end of the second quarter of 2015. Under our JUMP! On Demand program, the cost of a leased wireless device is depreciated over the lease term to its estimated residual value. The total number of devices under lease was higher year-over-year, resulting in higher depreciation expense.Cost of MetroPCS business combination increased $77 million or 26% primarily from higher network decommissioning costs associated with the business combination. In 2014, we began decommissioning the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant network cell sites. On July 1, 2015, T-Mobile officially completed the shutdown of the MetroPCS CDMA network.

These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry on key operating and financial measures.32Table of ContentsTotal CustomersA customer is generally defined as a SIM card with a unique T-Mobile identity number which is associated with an account that generates revenue. Branded customers generally include customers that are qualified either for postpaid service utilizing phones or mobile broadband devices (including tablets), where they generally pay after receiving service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance. Wholesale customers include M2M and MVNO customers that operate on our network, but are managed by wholesale partners.The following table sets forth the number of ending customers: December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 % Change 2016 Versus 2015 % Change 2015 Versus 2014(in thousands) Customers, end of period Branded postpaid phone customers31,297 29,355 25,844 7% 14%Branded postpaid mobile broadband customers3,130 2,340 1,341 34% 74%Total branded postpaid customers34,427 31,695 27,185 9% 17%Branded prepaid customers19,813 17,631 16,316 12% 8%Total branded customers54,240 49,326 43,501 10% 13%Wholesale customers17,215 13,956 11,517 23% 21%Total customers, end of period71,455 63,282 55,018 13% 15%The following table sets forth the number of net customer additions: Year Ended December 31, 2016 Versus 2015 2015 Versus 2014(in thousands)2016 2015 2014# Change % Change # Change % ChangeNet customer additions Branded postpaid phone customers3,307 3,511 4,047 (204) (6)% (536) (13)%Branded postpaid mobile broadband customers790 999 839 (209) (21)% 160 19 %Total branded postpaid customers4,097 4,510 4,886 (413) (9)% (376) (8)%Branded prepaid customers2,508 1,315 1,244 1,193 91 % 71 6 %Total branded customers6,605 5,825 6,130 780 13 % (305) (5)%Wholesale customers1,568 2,439 2,204 (871) (36)% 235 11 %Total net customer additions8,173 8,264 8,334 (91) (1)% (70) (1)%Transfer from branded postpaid phone customers(1,365) — — (1,365) 100 % — — %Transfer from branded prepaid customers(326) — — (326) 100 % — — %Transfer to wholesale customers1,691 — — 1,691 100 % — — %The MVNO Transaction resulted in a transfer of 1,365,000 branded postpaid phone customers and 326,000 branded prepaid customers to wholesale customers on September 1, 2016.

Going forward, we expect wholesale net customer additions to be significantly lower in 2017, as our MVNO partners deemphasize Lifeline in favor of higher ARPU customer categories. Wholesale net customer additions increased 235,000, or 11%, in 2015 primarily due to higher MVNO gross customer additions, partially offset by higher MVNO deactivations.Customers Per AccountCustomers per account is calculated by dividing the number of branded postpaid customers as of the end of the period by the number of branded postpaid accounts as of the end of the period. An account may include branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers.

Revision of prior periods was not practicable because certain historical data was no longer available. Average Revenue Per User, Average Billings Per UserARPU represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue realization per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. Branded postpaid phone ARPU excludes mobile broadband customers and related revenues. Average Billings Per User (“ABPU”) represents the average monthly customer billings, including monthly lease revenues and EIP billings before securitization, per customer. We believe branded postpaid ABPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate average branded postpaid customer billings as it is indicative of estimated cash collections, including device financing payments, from our customers each month.The following tables illustrate the calculation of our operating measures ARPU and ABPU and reconcile these measures to the related service revenues:(in millions, except average number of customers, ARPU and ABPU)Year Ended December 31, 2016 Versus 2015 2015 Versus 20142016 2015 2014 # Change % Change # Change % ChangeCalculation of Branded Postpaid Phone ARPU Branded postpaid service revenues$18,138 $16,383 $14,392 $1,755 11 % $1,991 14 %Less: Branded postpaid mobile broadband revenues(773) (588) (261) (185) 31 % (327) 125 %Branded postpaid phone service revenues$17,365 $15,795 $14,131 $1,570 10 % $1,664 12 %Divided by: Average number of branded postpaid phone customers (in thousands) and number of months in period 30,484 27,604 23,817 2,880 10 % 3,787 16 %Branded postpaid phone ARPU$47.47 $47.68 $49.44 $(0.21) NM $(1.76) (4)% Calculation of Branded Postpaid ABPU Branded postpaid service revenues$18,138 $16,383 $14,392 $1,755 11 % $1,991 14 %EIP billings5,432 5,494 3,596 (62) (1)% 1,898 53 %Lease revenues1,416 224 — 1,192 532 % 224 100 %Total billings for branded postpaid customers$24,986 $22,101 $17,988 $2,885 13 % $4,113 23 %Divided by: Average number of branded postpaid customers (in thousands) and number of months in period33,184 29,341 24,683 3,843 13 % 4,658 19 %Branded postpaid ABPU$62.75 $62.77 $60.73 $(0.02) NM $2.04 3 % Calculation of Branded Prepaid ARPU Branded prepaid service revenues$8,553 $7,553 $6,986 $1,000 13 % $567 8 %Divided by: Average number of branded prepaid customers (in thousands) and number of months in period 18,797 16,704 15,691 2,093 13 % 1,013 6 %Branded prepaid ARPU$37.92 $37.68 $37.10 $0.24 1 % $0.58 2 %NM - Not Meaningful35Table of ContentsBranded Postpaid Phone ARPU:Branded postpaid phone ARPU decreased $0.21, in 2016 primarily from:•Decreases due to an increase in the non-cash net revenue deferral for Data Stash;•Dilution from promotional activities; partially offset by •Higher data attach rates;•The positive impact from our T-Mobile ONE rate plans;•The transfer of customers as part of the MVNO transaction as those customers had lower ARPU;•Continued growth of our insurance programs; and •Higher regulatory program revenues.We are making an accounting change in 2017 to include imputed interest associated with EIP receivables in Other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, which will be excluded from branded postpaid phone ARPU.Branded postpaid phone ARPU decreased $1.76, or 4%, in 2015 primarily from:•Dilution from the continued growth of customers on Simple Choice plans and promotions targeting families; partially offset by•An increase in regulatory program revenues.Branded Postpaid ABPU:Branded postpaid ABPU decreased $0.02 in 2016 primarily from:•Lower EIP billings due to the impact of our JUMP!

Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a metric to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, network decommissioning costs as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance and certain other nonrecurring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. The following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure: Year Ended December 31, 2016 Versus 2015 2015 Versus 2014(in millions)2016 2015 2014 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeNet income$1,460 $733 $247 $727 99 % $486 197%Adjustments: Interest expense1,418 1,085 1,073 333 31 % 12 1%Interest expense to affiliates312 411 278 (99) (24)% 133 48%Interest income(261) (420) (359) 159 (38)% (61) 17%Other expense, net6 11 11 (5) (45)% — —%Income tax expense867 245 166 622 254 % 79 48%Operating income 3,802 2,065 1,416 1,737 84 % 649 46%Depreciation and amortization6,243 4,688 4,412 1,555 33 % 276 6%Cost of MetroPCS business combination104 376 299 (272) (72)% 77 26%Stock-based compensation (1)235 222 211 13 6 % 11 5%Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses (1)— — (720) — NM 720 NMOther, net (1)7 42 18 (35) (83)% 24 NMAdjusted EBITDA$10,391 $7,393 $5,636 $2,998 41 % $1,757 31%Net income margin (Net income divided by service revenues)5% 3% 1% 200 bps 200 bpsAdjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by service revenues)37% 30% 25% 700 bps 500 bpsNM - Not Meaningful(1)Stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree to stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements.

On Demand program at the end of the second quarter of 2015. Additionally, the costs of leased devices, which are capitalized and depreciated over the lease term, are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. In connection with JUMP! On Demand, we had lease revenues of $1.4 billion in 2016, and depreciation expense of $1.5 billion related to leased wireless devices in 2016; and•Focused cost control and synergies realized from the MetroPCS business combination, primarily in cost of services; partially offset by37Table of Contents•Higher selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to strategic investments to support our growing customer base, including higher employee-related costs, higher commissions driven by an increase in branded customer additions and higher promotional costs.We are making an accounting change in 2017 to include imputed interest associated with EIP receivables in Other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, which will be included in Adjusted EBITDA. The impact from this accounting change is expected to be approximately $0.2 to $0.3 billion in 2017.Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.8 billion, or 31%, in 2015 primarily from:•Increased branded postpaid and prepaid revenues driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and the ongoing success of our promotional activities;•Focused cost control and synergies realized from the MetroPCS business combination, especially in cost of services;•Lower losses on equipment in 2015 primarily due to an increase in lease revenues, which are recognized over the lease term, resulting from the launch of our JUMP! On Demand at the end of the second quarter of 2015. Additionally, the costs of leased devices, which are capitalized and depreciated over the lease term, are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. In connection with JUMP! On Demand, we had lease revenues of $224 million in 2015, and depreciation expense of $312 million related to leased wireless devices in 2015; partially offset by •Higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt, capital leases, common and preferred stock, the sale of certain receivables, financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms and an unsecured revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom.

In 2015, purchases of property and equipment were higher compared to 2014 from the build-out of our 4G LTE network, as described above. Cash purchases of property and equipment includes capitalized interest of $142 million, $246 million and $64 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Debt As of December 31, 2016, our total debt was $27.8 billion, excluding our tower obligations, of which $27.4 billion was classified as long-term debt. Significant debt-related activity during 2016 included:•In March 2016, T-Mobile USA, a subsidiary of T-Mobile US, Inc., and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into a purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom AG (“Deutsche Telekom”), our majority stockholder, under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom $2.0 billion of 5.300% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “5.300% Senior Notes”) for an aggregate purchase price of $2.0 billion. As amended in October 2016, if T-Mobile USA does not elect to issue the 5.300% Senior Notes on or prior to May 5, 2017, the commitment under the purchase agreement terminates and T-Mobile USA must reimburse Deutsche Telekom for the cost of its hedging arrangements (if any) related to the transaction. In addition, T-Mobile USA is required to reimburse Deutsche Telekom for its cost of hedging arrangements related to the extension for the duration of the extended commitments.•In April 2016, T-Mobile USA issued $1.0 billion of public 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024. •In April 2016, T-Mobile USA entered into a purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom, under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom up to $1.35 billion of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024 and (iii) entered into another purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom, under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom up to an additional $650 million of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024. •The purchase price for the 6.000% Senior Notes that may be issued under the $1.35 billion purchase agreement will be approximately 103.316% of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued. As amended in October 2016, if T-Mobile USA does not elect to issue the 6.000% Senior Notes under the $1.35 billion purchase agreement on or prior to May 5, 2017 or elects to issue less than $1.35 billion of 6.000% Senior Notes, any unused portion of the commitment under the purchase agreement terminates and T-Mobile USA must reimburse Deutsche Telekom for the cost of its hedging arrangements (if any) related to the transaction. In addition, T-Mobile USA is required to reimburse Deutsche Telekom for its cost of hedging arrangements related to the extension for the duration of the extended commitments.•In April 2016, T-Mobile USA entered into another purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom, in which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom up to an additional $650 million of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024. The purchase price for the 6.000% Senior Notes that may be issued under the $650 million purchase agreement will be approximately 104.047% of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued. As amended in October 2016, if T-Mobile USA does not elect to issue the 6.000% Senior Notes under the $650 million purchase agreement on or prior to May 5, 2017 or elects to issue less than $650 million Senior Notes, any unused portion of the commitment under the purchase agreement terminates and T-Mobile USA must reimburse Deutsche Telekom for the cost of its hedging arrangements (if any) related to the transaction. In addition, T-Mobile USA is required to reimburse Deutsche Telekom for its cost of hedging arrangements related to the extension for the duration of the extended commitments.•We have entered into uncommitted capital lease facilities with certain partners, which provide us with the ability to enter into capital leases for network equipment and services. As of December 31, 2016, we have committed to $1.3 billion of capital leases under these capital lease facilities, of which $799 million was executed during the year ended December 31, 2016. We expect to enter into up to an additional $900 million in capital lease commitments during 2017.•In December 2016, we terminated our $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom. In addition, T-Mobile USA entered into a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom which comprised of (i) a three-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement and (ii) a three-year $1.5 billion senior 40Table of Contentssecured revolving credit agreement. As of December 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.•In January 2017, T-Mobile USA borrowed $4.0 billion under a secured term loan facility (“Incremental Term Loan Facility”) with Deutsche Telekom to refinance $1.98 billion of outstanding secured term loans under its Term Loan Credit Agreement dated November 9, 2015, with the remaining net proceeds from the transaction intended to be used to redeem callable high yield debt. The loans under the Incremental Term Loan Facility were drawn in two tranches on January 31, 2017 (i) $2.0 billion of which will bear interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% and will mature on November 9, 2022 and (ii) $2.0 billion of which will bear interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% and will mature on January 31, 2024. The Incremental Term Loan Facility increases Deutsche Telekom’s incremental term loan commitment provided to T-Mobile USA under that certain First Incremental Facility Amendment dated as of December 29, 2016 from $660 million to $2.0 billion and provides to T-Mobile USA an additional $2.0 billion incremental term loan commitment. See Note 14 – Subsequent Events of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.See Note 7 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. We could seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2017, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future FCC spectrum license auctions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. Excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months. Our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures and redemption of high yield callable debt. We determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment. The indentures and credit facilities governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the Issuer to loan funds or make payments to the Parent. However, the Issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the Parent under the terms of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of December 31, 2016.Capital ExpendituresOur liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure. Property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to our network transformation, including the build out of 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses. We expect cash capital expenditures for property and equipment to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.1 billion in 2017, excluding capitalized interest. This does not include property and equipment obtained through capital lease agreements, leased wireless devices transferred from inventory or purchases of spectrum licenses. Similar to 2016, cash capital expenditures will be front-end loaded in 2017 due to the completion of the 700 MHz A-Block build-out.In particular, we are participating in the FCC broadcast incentive auction of low-band 600 MHz spectrum licenses that is currently in-progress. If we win spectrum in the auction, we may incur substantial additional expenditures for the purchase price and to gain access to such spectrum. Any such amounts would be funded primarily through cash on hand and borrowings. As a result, our level of debt could increase.41Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of December 31, 2016 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods:(in millions)Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years More Than 5 Years TotalLong-term debt (1)$20 $3,040 $7,790 $15,330 $26,180Interest on long-term debt1,679 3,270 2,568 1,925 9,442Capital lease obligations, including interest390 669 350 214 1,623Tower obligations (2)184 368 370 1,164 2,086Operating leases (3)2,417 3,950 2,613 2,188 11,168Purchase obligations (4)2,011 1,818 1,330 960 6,119Network decommissioning (5)112 176 83 48 419Total contractual obligations$6,813 $13,291 $15,104 $21,829 $57,037(1)Represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment, capital lease obligations and vendor financing arrangements.

See Note 8 – Tower Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.(3)As of December 31, 2016, we have updated the future minimum lease payments for all cell site leases presented above to include only payments due for the initial non-cancelable lease term only as they represent the payments which we cannot avoid at our option and also corresponds to our lease term assessment for new leases. This update had the effect of reducing our operating lease commitments included in the table above by $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2016. See Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.(4)T-Mobile calculated the minimum obligation for certain agreements to purchase goods or services based on termination fees that can be paid to exit the contract. Termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due in less than one year, as this is the earliest T-Mobile could exit these contracts. For certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. This table does not include open purchase orders as of December 31, 2016 under normal business purposes. See Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.(5)Represents future undiscounted cash flows related to decommissioned MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant cell sites as of December 31, 2016.Certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. Other long-term liabilities, excluding network decommissioning, have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor of such payments. In addition, because dividends on preferred stock are subject to approval by our Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred and the dividend has not been paid. See Note 13 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.The purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase handsets and accessories, equipment, software, programming and network services, and marketing activities, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent T-Mobile’s entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which T-Mobile is contractually committed. Where T-Mobile is committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether it takes delivery, T-Mobile has included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. Additionally, included within purchase obligations are amounts for the acquisition of spectrum licenses, which are subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In 2015, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain EIP accounts receivable on a revolving basis through November 2017 as an additional source of liquidity. In June 2016, the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $1.3 billion with a scheduled expiration date in November 2017. In 2014, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis through March 2017 as an additional source of liquidity. In November 2016, the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $950 million with a scheduled expiration date in March 2018. As of December 31, 2016, T-Mobile derecognized net receivables of $2.5 billion upon sale through these arrangements. See Note 3 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.42Table of ContentsRelated-Party TransactionsIn March 2016, T-Mobile USA entered into a purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom $2.0 billion of 5.300% Senior Notes due 2021 for an aggregate purchase price of $2.0 billion.In April 2016, T-Mobile USA entered into a purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom up to $1.35 billion of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024. The purchase price for the 6.000% Senior Notes that may be issued under the $1.35 billion purchase agreement will be approximately 103.316% of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued.In April 2016, T-Mobile USA entered into a purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom up to $650 million of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024.

In addition, T-Mobile USA entered into a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom which comprised of (i) a three-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement and (ii) a three-year $1.5 billion senior secured revolving credit agreement. As of December 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.In January 2017, T-Mobile USA borrowed $4.0 billion under a secured term loan facility (“Incremental Term Loan Facility”) with Deutsche Telekom to refinance $1.98 billion of outstanding secured term loans under its Term Loan Credit Agreement dated November 9, 2015, with the remaining net proceeds from the transaction intended to be used to redeem callable high yield debt.

The Incremental Term Loan Facility increases Deutsche Telekom’s incremental term loan commitment provided to T-Mobile USA under that certain First Incremental Facility Amendment dated as of December 29, 2016 from $660 million to $2.0 billion and provides to T-Mobile USA an additional $2.0 billion incremental term loan commitment. See Note 14 – Subsequent Events of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.We also have related party transactions associated with Deutsche Telekom or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany servicing and licensing. See Note 13 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Disclosure of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law. As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates in 2016 that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with Deutsche Telekom. We have relied upon Deutsche Telekom for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.Deutsche Telekom, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: Gostaresh Ertebatat Taliya, Irancell Telecommunications Services Company (“MTN Irancell”), Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran. In 43Table of Contents2016, gross revenues of all Deutsche Telekom affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic with Iran were less than $1.0 million and estimated net profits were less than $1.0 million. In addition, Deutsche Telekom, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, operating a fixed line network in their respective European home countries (in particular Germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the Embassy of Iran in those European countries. Gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities in 2016 were less than $0.1 million. We understand that Deutsche Telekom intends to continue these activities.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results as they require the use of estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.These policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.AllowancesWe maintain an allowance for estimated losses inherent in the accounts receivable and EIP receivable portfolios. When determining the allowance, we consider a number of factors, including historical experience and current collection trends, aging of the receivable portfolio, credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions. Credit collection risks are assessed for each type of receivable, such as EIP receivables, based upon historical and expected write-offs, net of recoveries, and an analysis of the aged receivable balances with reserves generally increasing as the receivable ages. To the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends or assumptions, the required allowance amounts could differ from the estimate. We write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date.We offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments over a period of up to 24 months using an EIP. At the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest as there is no stated rate of interest on the EIP receivables and record the EIP receivables at their present value, which is determined by discounting future payments at the imputed interest rate. The difference between the present value of the EIP receivables and their face amount results in a discount which is recorded as a direct reduction to the carrying value with a corresponding reduction to equipment revenues. We determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rates and the amount of expected credit losses on the EIP receivables. As a result, we do not recognize a separate valuation allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable. The imputed discount on EIP receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as Interest income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.Subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we assess the need for and, if necessary, recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated probable losses on the gross EIP receivables exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances. Total imputed discount and allowances as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately 8.0% and 8.2%, respectively, of the total amount of gross accounts receivable, including EIP receivables.DepreciationDepreciation commences once assets have been placed in service. We generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit. Leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to T-Mobile, which is generally the lease term. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history, assumptions about technology evolution and expected loss of leased wireless devices. When these factors indicate that an asset’s useful life is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book values are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining 44Table of Contentsestimated useful life. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4 – Property and Equipment of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management’s underlying estimates of useful lives.Evaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for ImpairmentWe assess the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, for potential impairment annually as of December 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is tested for impairment based on a two-step test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. We recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. In the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. We believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value. In the second step, we determine the fair values of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including those that currently may not be recorded. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the sum of the fair value of all of those assets and liabilities represents the implied goodwill amount. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than the carrying amount of goodwill, then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. We test spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with the management of the overall business at a national level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset group is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset group is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. If the carrying amount of spectrum licenses exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. We estimate the fair value of the spectrum licenses using the Greenfield approach, which is an income approach that estimates the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The Greenfield approach values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses). The value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. We base the assumptions underlying the Greenfield approach on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. Future cash flows in the Greenfield approach are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, EBITDA margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.The valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. If actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. The most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, EBITDA margins and the long-term growth rate. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 – Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding our annual impairment test and impairment charges.Guarantee Liabilities In 2013, we introduced a device trade-in program, Just Upgrade My Phone (“JUMP!”), which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. Participating customers must finance the purchase of a device on an EIP and have a qualifying T-Mobile monthly wireless service plan, which is treated as a single multiple-element arrangement when entered into at or near the same time. Upon qualifying JUMP! program upgrades, the customers’ remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade-in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new EIP. 45Table of ContentsFor customers who enroll in JUMP!, we defer and recognize a liability, for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. The guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which requires judgment, including estimating the customer's remaining EIP balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used device at trade-in, and the probability and timing of trade-in. When customers upgrade their device, the difference between the EIP balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. All assumptions are reviewed periodically. Rent Expense Most of the leases on our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of rent payable over time. We calculate straight-line rent expense for each of these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such amount that a renewal appears, at lease inception or significant modification, to be reasonably assured. We consider several factors in assessing whether renewal periods are reasonably assured of being exercised, including the continued maturation of our network nationwide, technological advances within the telecommunications industry and the availability of alternative sites. We make significant assumptions at lease inception in determining and assessing the factors that constitute a “penalty.” In doing so, we primarily consider costs incurred in acquiring and developing new sites, the useful life of site improvements and equipment costs, future economic conditions and the extent to which improvements in wireless technologies can be incorporated into a current assessment of whether an economic compulsion will exist in the future to renew a lease.Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. A valuation allowance is maintained against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available. We consider many factors when determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedSee Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding recently issued accounting standards.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to economic risks in the normal course of business, primarily from changes in interest rates. These risks, along with other business risks, impact our cost of capital. Our policy is to manage exposure related to fluctuations in interest rates in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term. We have established interest rate risk limits that are closely monitored by measuring interest rate sensitivities of our debt portfolio. We do not foresee significant changes in the strategies used to manage market risk in the near future.46Table of ContentsTo perform the sensitivity analysis, we assessed the risk of a change in the fair value from the effect of a hypothetical interest rate change of positive 150 and negative 50 basis points. As of December 31, 2016, the change in the fair value of our Senior Secured Term Loans, based on this hypothetical change, is shown in the table below: Carrying Amount Fair Value Fair Value Assuming(in millions) +150 Basis Point Shift -50 Basis Point ShiftSenior Secured Term Loans$1,980 $2,005 $1,864 $2,05547Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:44:12.539300

On January 25, 2017, we streamlined our Simple Choice plan offerings to new customers into our T-Mobile ONE plan.Depending on their credit profile, customers are qualified either for postpaid or prepaid service.5Table of ContentsOur device options for customers on T-Mobile ONE, and previously on Simple Choice plans, include:•Depending on their credit profile, qualifying customers who purchase a device from us have the option of financing all or a portion of the purchase price at the time of sale over an installment period of up to 24 months using our Equipment Installment Plan (“EIP”). •In addition, qualifying customers who finance their initial device with an EIP can enroll in our Just Upgrade My Phone (“JUMP!”®) program to later upgrade their device. Upon a qualifying JUMP! upgrade, the customer’s remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade-in their used device at the time of upgrade in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new EIP.•In 2015, we introduced JUMP! On Demand. With JUMP! On Demand, a low monthly payment covers the cost of leasing a new device and gives qualified customers the freedom to exchange it for a new device up to one time per month for no extra fee. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return their device in good working condition or purchase their device. Customers that choose to purchase their device have the option to finance their device over a nine-month EIP.Network The speed and capacity of our LTE network allows us to offer “America’s Best Unlimited Network” to our customers. Our advancements in network technology and our spectrum resources ensure we can continue to increase the breadth and depth of our network as the industry moves towards 5G.Spectrum GrowthWe provide mobile communication services utilizing mid-band spectrum licenses, such as Advanced Wireless Services (“AWS”) and Personal Communications Service (“PCS”), and low-band spectrum licenses utilizing our 600 MHz and 700 MHz spectrum.•We owned an average of 110 MHz of spectrum nationwide as of December 31, 2017, comprised of an average of 31 MHz in the 600 MHz band, 10 MHz in the 700 MHz band, 29 MHz in the 1900 MHz PCS band and 40 MHz in the AWS band. This is compared to an average of 79 MHz of spectrum nationwide as of December 31, 2016.•In April 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) announced the results of the broadcast incentive auction which showed that we purchased a nationwide average of 31 MHz of 600 MHz low-band spectrum for $8.0 billion. This spectrum covered 328 million points of presence (“POPs”) as of December 31, 2017. See Note 5 - Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.•As of December 31, 2017, T-Mobile owned approximately 41 MHz of low-band spectrum (600 MHz and 700 MHz), quadruple its pre-auction low-band holdings. The purchased spectrum covers 100% of the U.S. •As of December 31, 2017, at least 10 MHz of 600 MHz spectrum covering over 1.2 million square miles and approximately 62 million POPs was clear and available for deployment.•T-Mobile has actively engaged with broadcasters to accelerate FCC clearance timelines, entering into approximately 40 agreements with several parties. These agreements will, in aggregate, accelerate clearing, bringing the total clearing target to over 100 million POPs expected by year-end 2018. We expect to reach a clearing target of 250 million POPs by year-end 2019. T-Mobile remains committed to assisting broadcasters occupying 600 MHz spectrum to move to new frequencies.•In addition to spectrum clearing, T-Mobile aggressively started deployments of 600 MHz spectrum, lighting up spectrum in 586 cities and towns in 28 states across the country, covering 300,000 square miles as of December 31, 2017.•We had two new 600 MHz-capable devices in our retail distribution for the 2017 holiday season (LG V30 and Samsung GS8 Active). We expect more than a dozen new smartphones to be rolled out in 2018 to be 600 MHz-capable.•Our 600 MHz spectrum holdings will be used to deploy America's first nationwide 5G network expected by 2020.•Over the last year, we have entered into and closed on various agreements for the acquisition and exchange of 700 MHz A-Block, AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. See Note 5 – Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.6Table of Contents •We intend to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future FCC spectrum license auctions.•Our wireless infrastructure included approximately 61,000 macro sites and approximately 18,000 distributed antenna system (DAS) and small cell sites as of December 31, 2017. Network Coverage Growth•We continue to expand our coverage breadth and covered 322 million people with 4G LTE as of December 31, 2017.•By the end of 2018, we are targeting a population coverage of 325 million and a geographic coverage of 2.5 million square miles.Network Speed LeadershipAs “America’s Best Unlimited Network,” we offer the fastest nationwide 4G LTE upload and download speeds in the United States. The fourth quarter of 2017 is the 16th consecutive quarter we have led the industry in both categories, and this is based on the results of millions of user-generated speed tests.Network Capacity Growth We continue to expand our capacity through the re-farming of existing spectrum and implementation of new technologies including Voice over LTE (“VoLTE”), Carrier Aggregation, 4x4 MIMO, 256 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (“QAM”) and Licensed Assisted Access (“LAA”).•VoLTE comprised almost 80% of total voice calls as of December 31, 2017, compared to 64% as of December 31, 2016. Moving voice traffic to VoLTE frees up spectrum and allows for the transition of spectrum currently used for 2G and 3G to 4G LTE. We are leading the U.S. wireless industry in the rate of VoLTE adoption.•Carrier aggregation is live for our customers in over 875 markets. This advanced technology delivers superior speed and performance by bonding multiple discrete spectrum channels together. •4x4 MIMO is currently available in over 475 markets. This technology effectively delivers twice the speed and incremental network capacity to customers by doubling the number of data paths between the cell site and a customer's device. We plan to start deploying massive MIMO (FD-MIMO) in selected locations later in 2018.•We have rolled out 256 QAM in over 925 markets. 256 QAM increases the number of bits delivered per transmission to enable faster speed. T-Mobile is the first carrier globally to have rolled out the combination of carrier aggregation, 4x4 MIMO and 256 QAM.•T-Mobile is implementing a significant small cell program. We plan to roll out 25,000 small cells in 2018 and early 2019. This is on top of the approximately 18,000 small cells and DAS nodes already rolled out as of the end of 2017. In conjunction with the small cell rollout, we have also started rolling out License Assisted Access. The first LAA small cell went live in New York City in the fourth quarter of 2017.DistributionOur network expansion has provided a unique opportunity to grow our distribution footprint by over 30 million POPs from the beginning of 2016 through year-end 2017, bringing our total distribution footprint to over 260 million people. In 2017, we built nearly 1,500 new T-Mobile stores and over 1,300 net new MetroPCS stores. Many of these additional stores are in geographic areas where T-Mobile had not previously competed. In 2017, we opened T-Mobile stores in more than 600 cities and towns where we did not previously have a retail presence.As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 20,100 total points of distribution, including approximately 2,200 direct owned stores, 13,300 exclusive third party locations and 4,600 non-exclusive third-party locations as well as distribution through our websites and customer care channels. Our distribution density in major metropolitan areas provides customers with the convenience of having retail and service locations close to where they live and work.Expansion of our distribution footprint will continue in 2018. In 2018, our retail store expansion will be exclusively focused on Greenfield markets, building on this significant future growth opportunity.7Table of ContentsCompetitionThe wireless telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We are the third largest provider of postpaid service plans and the largest provider of prepaid service plans in the U.S. as measured by customers. Our competitors include other national carriers, such as AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”), Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”) and Sprint Corporation (“Sprint”). AT&T and Verizon are significantly larger than us and enjoy greater resources and scale advantages as compared to us. In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller regional carriers, existing MVNOs, including TracFone Wireless, Inc. and Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”), and future MVNOs, such as Charter Communications, Inc., many of which offer or plan to offer no-contract, postpaid and prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice, messaging and data services, using alternative technologies or services. Competitive factors within the wireless telecommunications industry include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies, availability of additional spectrum licenses and regulatory changes. Some competitors have shown a willingness to use aggressive pricing as a source of differentiation. Other competitors have sought to add ancillary services, like mobile video, to enhance their offerings. Taken together, the competitive factors we face continue to put pressure on growth and margins as companies compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customers.EmployeesAs of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 51,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions.Regulation The FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The FCC has a number of complex requirements and proceedings that affect our operations and that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection, and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly. Wireless communications providers must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10 years in the case of cellular, PCS and point-to-point microwave licenses. AWS licenses have an initial term of 15 years, with successive 10-year terms thereafter. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, Congress’ and the FCC’s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (“CMRS”), which includes cellular, PCS and specialized mobile radio, could significantly increase competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers’ spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers. Congress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest albeit subject to review. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our company by Deutsche Telekom. This declaratory ruling, and our licenses, are conditioned on Deutsche Telekom’s and the Company’s compliance with a network security agreement 8Table of Contentswith the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security. Failure to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation of our spectrum licenses.While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communication providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of devices while driving, zoning and land use. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other federal agencies have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are to some extent unknown and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.

The information on our websites is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnishes to, the SEC.Item 1A. Risk FactorsIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating T-Mobile. Our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results, as well as the price of our common stock and other securities, could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.Risks Related to Our Business and the Wireless IndustryCompetition, industry consolidation, and changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We have multiple wireless competitors, some of which have greater resources than us and compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings; price; network coverage, speed and quality; and customer service. We expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry’s customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rates, or possibly negative, leading to ongoing competition for customers. We also expect that our customers’ appetite for data services will place increasing demands on our network capacity. This competition and our capacity will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers. Our ability to compete will depend on, among other things, continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality and customer service, effective marketing and selling of products and services, innovation, attractive pricing, and cost management, all of which will involve significant expenses.Joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances in the wireless sector have resulted in and are expected to result in larger competitors competing for a limited number of customers. The two largest national wireless communication providers currently serve a significant percentage of all wireless customers and hold significant spectrum and other resources. Our largest competitors may be able to enter into exclusive handset, device, or content arrangements, execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaigns, or otherwise improve their cost position relative to ours. In addition, refusal of our large competitors to provide critical access to resources and inputs, such as roaming services on reasonable terms, could improve their position within the wireless broadband mobile services industry.We face intense and increasing competition from other service providers as industry sectors converge, such as cable, telecom services and content, satellite, and other service providers. Companies like Comcast and AT&T (and AT&T’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner, Inc.) will have the scale and assets to aggressively compete in a converging industry. Verizon, through the acquisitions of AOL, Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. is also a significant competitor focusing on premium content offerings to diversify outside of core wireless. Further, some of our competitors now provide content services in addition to voice and 9Table of Contentsbroadband services, and consumers are increasingly accessing video content from Internet-based providers and applications, all of which create increased competition in this area. These factors, together with the effects of the increasing aggregate penetration of wireless services in all metropolitan areas and the ability of our larger competitors to use resources to build out their networks and to quickly deploy advanced technologies, could make it more difficult for us to continue to attract and retain customers, and may adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.The scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum, and regulations relating to spectrum use, may adversely affect our business strategy and financial condition and operating results.We will need to acquire additional spectrum in order to continue our customer growth, expand and deepen our coverage, maintain our quality of service, meet increasing customer demands and deploy new technologies. We will be at a competitive disadvantage and possibly experience erosion in the quality of service in certain markets if we fail to gain access to necessary spectrum before reaching network capacity. As a result, we are actively seeking to make additional investment in spectrum, which could be significant.The continued interest in, and acquisition of, spectrum by existing carriers and others may reduce our ability to acquire and/or increase the cost of acquiring spectrum in the secondary market or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other means, including government auctions. We may need to enter into spectrum sharing or leasing arrangements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and may involve significant expenditures. Gaining access to the spectrum we won in the FCC 600 MHz auction in 2017 may take up to three years or more. Any material delay could adversely impact our ability to implement our plans and efforts to improve our network. In addition, our return on investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customers and to provide additional services and usage to existing customers. As a result, the return on any investment in spectrum that we make may not be as much as we anticipate or take longer than expected. Additionally, we may be unable to secure the spectrum we need in any auction we may elect to participate in or in the secondary market, on favorable terms or at all.The FCC may impose conditions on the use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas. Additional conditions that may be imposed by the FCC include heightened build-out requirements, limited license terms or renewal rights, and clearing obligations that may make it less attractive or less economical to acquire spectrum. In addition, rules may be established for future government spectrum auctions that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas.If we cannot acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise, if competitors acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide services competitive with our services, or if we cannot deploy services over acquired spectrum on a timely basis without burdensome conditions, at reasonable cost, and while maintaining network quality levels, then our ability to attract and retain customers and our associated financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy.Significant technological changes continue to impact the communications industry. In general, these technological changes enhance communications and enable a broader array of companies to offer services competitive with ours. In order to grow and remain competitive with new and evolving technologies in our industry, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, continually invest in our network, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings to address our current and potential customers’ changing demands. Enhancing our network, such as deploying 5G, is subject to risk from equipment changes and migration of customers from existing spectrum bands and the potential inability to secure spectrum necessary to deploy advanced technologies. Adopting new and sophisticated technologies may result in implementation issues such as scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints, regulatory permitting issues, customer dissatisfaction, and other issues that could cause delays in launching new technological capabilities, which in turn could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the upgrades. In general, the development of new services in the wireless telecommunications industry will require us to anticipate and respond to the continuously changing demands of our customers, which we may not be able to do accurately or timely. If our new services fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with these services are higher than anticipated, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.10Table of ContentsWe could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches, whether directly or by way of third parties.Our business, like that of most retailers and wireless companies, involves the receipt, storage, and transmission of confidential information, including sensitive personal information and payment card information, confidential information about our employees and suppliers, and other sensitive information about our Company, such as our business plans, transactions and intellectual property (“confidential information”). Unauthorized access to confidential information may be difficult to anticipate, detect, or prevent, particularly given that the methods of unauthorized access constantly change and evolve. We may experience unauthorized access or distribution of confidential information by third parties or employees, errors or breaches by third party suppliers, or other breaches of security that compromise the integrity of confidential information, and such breaches can have a materially adverse effect on our business or damage our reputation.Cyber-attacks, such as denial of service and other malicious attacks, could disrupt our internal systems and applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers, and have other adverse effects on our business and that of others who depend on our services. As a telecommunications carrier, we are considered a critical infrastructure provider and therefore may be more likely to be the target of such attacks. Such attacks against companies may be perpetrated by a variety of groups or persons, including those in jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are ineffective or unavailable, and such attacks may even be perpetrated by or at the behest of foreign governments.In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third-party service providers when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. We and our third-party service providers have been subject to unauthorized access to confidential information in the past, including a breach at one of our credit check providers in September 2015 in which a subset of records containing current and potential customer information was compromised by an external party.Our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and to defend against attacks seeking to disrupt our services must be continually evaluated and revised to address the ever-evolving threat landscape. We cannot make assurances that all preventive actions taken will adequately repel a significant attack or prevent information security breaches or the misuses of data, unauthorized access by third parties or employees, or exploits against third-party supplier environments. If we are subject to such attacks or security breaches, we may incur significant costs, be subject to regulatory investigations, sanctions and private litigation, experience disruptions to our operations or suffer damage to our reputation. Any future cyber-attacks or security breaches may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.System failures and business disruptions may allow unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other systems which could be materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.To be successful, we must provide our customers with reliable, trustworthy service and protect the communications, location, and personal information shared or generated by our customers. We rely upon both our systems and networks and the systems and networks of other providers and suppliers to provide and support our services and, in some cases, protect our customers’ information and our information. Failure of our or others’ systems, networks, or infrastructure may prevent us from providing reliable service or may allow for the unauthorized use of or interference with our networks and other systems or for the compromise of customer information. Examples of these risks include:•human error such as responding to deceptive communications or unintentionally executing malicious code;•physical damage, power surges or outages, or equipment failure, including those as a result of severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, political instability and volatility, and acts of war;•theft of customer and/or proprietary information offered for sale for competitive advantage or corporate extortion;•unauthorized access to our IT and business systems or to our network and critical infrastructure and those of our suppliers and other providers;•supplier failures or delays; and•system failures or outages of our business systems or communications network.Such events could cause us to lose customers, lose revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational damage, and subject us to litigation or governmental investigation. Remediation costs could include liability for information loss, repairing infrastructure and systems, and/or costs of incentives offered to customers. Our insurance may not cover, or be adequate to fully reimburse us for, costs and losses associated with such events.11Table of ContentsWe are in the process of implementing a new billing system, which will support a portion of our subscribers, while maintaining our legacy billing system. Any unanticipated difficulties, disruption, or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial, and reputational effects on our business.We are currently implementing a new customer billing system, which involves a new third-party supported platform and utilization of a phased deployment approach. Post implementation, we plan to operate both the existing and new billing systems in parallel to aid in the transition to the new system until all phases of the conversion are complete.The implementation may cause major system or business disruptions, or we may fail to implement the new billing system in a timely or effective manner. In addition, the third-party billing services supporting vendor may experience errors, cyber-attacks, or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact us and over which we may have limited control. Interruptions and/or failure of this new billing services system could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to provide or bill for our services, retain customers, attract new customers, or negatively impact overall customer experience. Any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and reputational damage.We rely on third parties to provide products or services for the operation of our business, and a failure or inability by such parties to provide these products or services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We depend heavily on suppliers, their subcontractors, and other third parties in order for us to efficiently operate our business. Due to the complexity of our business, it is not unusual for multiple vendors located in multiple locations to help us to develop, maintain, and troubleshoot products and services, such as network components, software development services, and billing and customer service support. Our suppliers may provide services outside of the United States, which carries associated additional regulatory and legal obligations. We commonly rely upon the suppliers to provide contractual assurances and accurate information regarding risks associated with their provision of products or services in accordance with our expectations and standards such as our supplier code of conduct and our third party-risk management standards. Failure of such suppliers to comply with our expectations and standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.There are multiple sources for the types of products and services we purchase or use. However, there are a limited number of suppliers for billing services, voice and data communications transport services, network infrastructure, equipment, handsets, other devices, and payment processing services, among other products and services. Disruptions or failure of such suppliers to adequately perform could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In the past, our suppliers, contractors, service providers and third-party retailers may not have always performed at the levels we expected or at the levels required by their contracts. Our business could be severely disrupted if key suppliers, contractors, service providers, or third-party retailers fail to comply with their contracts or become unable to continue provision of services or supplies. Our business could also be disrupted if we experience delays or service degradation during any transition to a new outsourcing provider or other supplier or if we are required to replace the supplied products or services with those from another source, especially if the replacement becomes necessary on short notice. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Economic, political, and market conditions may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results, as well as our access to financing on favorable terms or at all.Our business, financial condition, and operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, rates of inflation (or concerns about deflation), unemployment rates, economic growth, energy costs, and other macro-economic factors. Difficult, or worsening, general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Market volatility, political and economic uncertainty, and weak economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results in a number of ways. Our services are available to a broad customer base, a significant segment of which may be more vulnerable to weak economic conditions. We may have greater difficulty in gaining new customers within this segment, and existing customers may be more likely to terminate service due to an inability to pay. Weak economic conditions and credit conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers and dealers, some of which have filed for or may be considering bankruptcy, or may experience cash flow or liquidity problems, or are unable to obtain or refinance 12Table of Contentscredit such that they may no longer be able to operate. Any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market, or sell our products and services. In addition, instability in the global financial markets could lead to periodic volatility in the credit, equity, and fixed income markets. This volatility could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financing arrangements include restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility.The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financing arrangements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions, and incurrence-based ratio tests, may limit our or our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in some transactions, including the following:•incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock;•paying dividends, redeeming capital stock, or making other restricted payments or investments;•selling or buying assets, properties, or licenses, including participating in future FCC auctions of spectrum or private sales of spectrum;•developing assets, properties, or licenses that we have or in the future may procure;•creating liens on assets;•engaging in mergers, acquisitions, business combinations, or other transactions;•entering into transactions with affiliates; and•placing restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments.These restrictions could limit our ability to react to changes in our operating environment or the economy. Any future indebtedness that we incur may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our debt agreements and other financing arrangements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these agreements and other agreements, giving our lenders the right to terminate any commitments they had made to provide us with further funds and to require us to repay all amounts then outstanding. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our ability to make payments on our debt, to repay our existing indebtedness when due, and to fund our capital-intensive business and operations, and significant planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is in turn subject to the operational risks described elsewhere in this report. Our debt service obligations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and operating results, including by:•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the communications industry or pursuing growth opportunities;•reducing the amount of cash available for other operational or strategic needs; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors who are less leveraged than we are.Some of our debt also has a floating rate of interest linked to various indices. If the change in indices result in interest rate increases, debt service requirements will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. In addition, any agreements we have and may continue to enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increases may not offer complete protection from this risk, and any portion not subject to such agreements would have full exposure to interest rate increases. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could result in a loss of investor confidence regarding our financial statements or may have a material adverse effect on our business. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we along with our independently registered public accounting firm are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We rely heavily on IT systems as an important part of our internal controls in order to operate, transact, and otherwise manage our business, as well as provide 13Table of Contentseffective and timely reporting of our financial results. Failure to design and maintain effective internal controls, including those over our IT systems, could constitute a material weakness that could result in inaccurate financial statements, inaccurate disclosures, or failure to prevent fraud. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm were unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence regarding our financial statements and our business could be materially adversely affected.Our financial condition and operating results will be impaired if we experience high fraud rates related to device financing, credit cards, dealers, or subscriptions.Our operating costs could increase substantially as a result of fraud, including device financing, customer credit card, subscription, or dealer fraud. If our fraud detection strategies and processes are not successful in detecting and controlling fraud, whether directly or by way of the systems, processes, and operations of third parties such as national retailers, dealers, and others, the resulting loss of revenue or increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.We rely on highly-skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture.The market for highly-skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly-skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, changes to U.S. immigration policy, competitors’ hiring practices, employee tolerance for the significant amount of change within and demands on our Company and our industry, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain and motivate our existing employees and to attract new employees. If we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employees and attracting new key personnel, we may not be able to meet our business plan and, as a result, our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected. Any acquisition, investment, or merger may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business.We may pursue acquisitions of, investments in or mergers with businesses, technologies, services and/or products that complement or expand our business. Some of these potential transactions could be significant relative to the size of our business and operations. Any such transaction would involve a number of risks and could present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:•diversion of management attention from running our existing business;•increased costs to integrate the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the business involved in any such transaction with our business;•difficulties in effectively integrating the financial and operational reporting systems of the business involved in any such transaction into (or supplanting such systems with) our financial and operational reporting infrastructure and internal control framework in an effective and timely manner;•potential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process or as a result of any litigation arising in connection with any such transaction;•significant transaction expenses in connection with any such transaction, whether consummated or not;•risks related to our ability to obtain any required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate any such transaction;•acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and any such financing could significantly increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings; and•any business, technology, service, or product involved in any such transaction may significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from our transaction, which could, among other things, also result in a write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with such transaction.For any or all of these reasons, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment, or merger may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.14Table of ContentsRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory MattersChanges in regulations or in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale, and interconnection of wireless communications systems, as do some state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and the resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. Additionally, the FTC and other federal and state agencies have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection, and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of wireless products and services. We are subject to regulatory oversight by various federal, state and local agencies, as well as judicial review and actions, on issues related to the wireless industry that include, but are not limited to: roaming, interconnection, spectrum allocation and licensing, facilities siting, pole attachments, intercarrier compensation, Universal Service Fund (“USF”), net neutrality, 911 services, consumer protection, consumer privacy, and cybersecurity. We are also subject to regulations in connection with other aspects of our business, including handset financing and insurance activities.We cannot assure you that the FCC or any other federal, state or local agencies will not adopt regulations or take enforcement or other actions that would adversely affect our business, impose new costs, or require changes in current or planned operations. For example, under the Obama administration, the FCC established new net neutrality and privacy regimes that applied to our operations. Both sets of rules potentially subjected some of our initiatives and practices to more burdensome requirements and heightened scrutiny by federal and state regulators, the public, edge providers, and private litigants regarding whether such initiatives or practices are compliant. While the FCC rules are now largely rolled back under the Trump administration, some state legislators and regulators are seeking to replace them with state laws, perpetuating uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment around these issues.In addition, states are increasingly focused on the quality of service and support that wireless communication providers provide to their customers and several states have proposed or enacted new and potentially burdensome regulations in this area. We also face potential investigations by, and inquiries from or actions by state Public Utility Commissions. We also cannot assure you that Congress will not amend the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority and which serves to limit state authority, or enact other legislation in a manner that could be adverse to our business. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We could be subject to fines, forfeitures, and other penalties (including, in extreme cases, revocation of our spectrum licenses) for failure to comply with FCC or other governmental regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.Unfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We are regularly involved in a number of legal proceedings before various state and federal courts, the FCC, the FTC, other federal agencies, and state and local regulatory agencies, including state attorneys general. Such legal proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel. The assessment of the outcome of legal proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or pursuant to final judgment, order or decree may differ materially from amounts accrued in our financial statements. In addition, litigation or similar proceedings could impose restraints on our current or future manner of doing business. Such potential outcomes including judgments, awards, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We offer highly regulated financial services products. These products expose us to a wide variety of state and federal regulations.The financing of devices, through our EIP and JUMP! On Demand programs, has expanded our regulatory compliance obligations. Failure to remain compliant with applicable regulations, may increase our risk exposure in the following areas:•consumer complaints and potential examinations or enforcement actions by federal and state regulatory agencies, including but not limited to the Consumer Financial Protection Board, state attorneys general, the FCC and the FTC; and15Table of Contents•regulatory fines, penalties, enforcement actions, civil litigation, and/or class action lawsuits.Failure to comply with applicable regulations and the realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.We may not be able to adequately protect the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.We rely on a combination of patent, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which offer only limited protection. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary rights. We may not have the ability in certain jurisdictions to adequately protect intellectual property rights. Moreover, others may independently develop processes and technologies that are competitive to ours. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. We cannot be sure that any legal actions against such infringers will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. We cannot assure you that our pending or future patent applications will be granted or enforceable, or that the rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide us with any competitive advantages. In addition, we cannot assure you that any trademark or service mark registrations will be issued with respect to pending or future applications or will provide adequate protection of our brands. We do not have insurance coverage for intellectual property losses, and as such, a charge for an anticipated settlement or an adverse ruling awarding damages represents an unplanned loss event. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. We are a defendant in numerous intellectual property lawsuits, including patent infringement lawsuits, which exposes us to the risk of adverse financial impact either by way of significant settlement amounts or damage awards. As we adopt new technologies and new business systems, and provide customers with new products and/or services, we may face additional infringement claims. These claims could require us to cease certain activities or to cease selling relevant products and services. These claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend, and divert management resources, and expose us to significant damages awards or settlements, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. In addition to litigation directly involving our Company, our vendors and suppliers can be threatened with patent litigation and/or subjected to the threat of disruption or blockage of sale, use, or importation of products, posing the risk of supply chain interruption to particular products and associated services which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Our business may be impacted by new or changing tax laws or regulations and actions by federal, state, and/or local agencies, or how judicial authorities apply tax laws.In connection with the products and services we sell, we calculate, collect, and remit various federal, state, and local taxes, surcharges and regulatory fees (“tax” or “taxes”) to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including federal USF contributions and common carrier regulatory fees. In addition, we incur and pay state and local taxes and fees on purchases of goods and services used in our business. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In many cases, the application of tax laws (including the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the United States) is uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services, such as broadband internet access and cloud related services. Changes in tax laws could also impact revenue on tax inclusive plans.In the event that we have incorrectly described, disclosed, calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts that were due to governmental authorities, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In the event that federal, state, and/or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes on our network, operations, or services, or seek to impose new taxes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Our wireless licenses are subject to renewal and may be revoked in the event that we violate applicable laws. Our existing wireless licenses are subject to renewal upon the expiration of the 10-year or 15-year period for which they are granted. Historically, the FCC has approved our license renewal applications. However, the Communications Act provides that licenses may be revoked for cause and license renewal applications denied if the FCC determines that a renewal would not serve the public interest. In addition, our licenses are subject to our compliance with the terms set forth in the agreement 16Table of Contentspertaining to national security among Deutsche Telekom, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and the Company. The failure of Deutsche Telekom or the Company to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation or non-renewal of our spectrum licenses. If we fail to timely file to renew any wireless license or fail to meet any regulatory requirements for renewal, including construction and substantial service requirements, we could be denied a license renewal. Many of our wireless licenses are subject to interim or final construction requirements and there is no guarantee that the FCC will find our construction, or the construction of prior licensees, sufficient to meet the build-out or renewal requirements. The FCC has pending a rulemaking proceeding to reevaluate, among other things, its wireless license renewal showings and standards and may in this or other proceedings promulgate changes or additional substantial requirements or conditions to its renewal rules, including revising license build-out requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the FCC will renew our wireless licenses upon their expiration. If any of our wireless licenses were to be revoked or not renewed upon expiration, we would not be permitted to provide services under that license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our business could be adversely affected by findings of product liability for health/safety risks from wireless devices and transmission equipment, as well as by changes to regulations/radio frequency emission standards.We do not manufacture the devices or other equipment that we sell, and we depend on our suppliers to provide defect-free and safe equipment. Suppliers are required by applicable law to manufacture their devices to meet certain governmentally imposed safety criteria. However, even if the devices we sell meet the regulatory safety criteria, we could be held liable with the equipment manufacturers and suppliers for any harm caused by products we sell if such products are later found to have design or manufacturing defects. We generally seek to enter into indemnification agreements with the manufacturers who supply us with devices to protect us from losses associated with product liability, but we cannot guarantee that we will be fully protected against all losses associated with a product that is found to be defective.Allegations have been made that the use of wireless handsets and wireless transmission equipment, such as cell towers, may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer and brain tumors. Lawsuits have been filed against manufacturers and carriers in the industry claiming damages for alleged health problems arising from the use of wireless handsets. In addition, the FCC has from time to time gathered data regarding wireless handset emissions and its assessment of this issue may evolve based on its findings. The media has also reported incidents of handset battery malfunction, including reports of batteries that have overheated. These allegations may lead to changes in regulatory standards. There have also been other allegations regarding wireless technology, including allegations that wireless handset emissions may interfere with various electronic medical devices (including hearing aids and pacemakers), airbags and anti-lock brakes. Defects in the products of our suppliers, such as the 2016 recall by a handset Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) on one of its smartphone devices, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Additionally, there are safety risks associated with the use of wireless devices while operating vehicles or equipment. Concerns over any of these risks and the effect of any legislation, rules or regulations that have been and may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to sell our wireless services.Risks Related to Ownership of our Common StockWe are controlled by Deutsche Telekom, whose interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders.Deutsche Telekom beneficially owns and possesses majority voting power of the fully diluted shares of our common stock. Through its control of the voting power of our common stock and the rights granted to Deutsche Telekom in our certificate of incorporation and the Stockholder’s Agreement, Deutsche Telekom controls the election of our directors and all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. By virtue of Deutsche Telekom’s voting control, we are a “controlled company,” as defined in the NASDAQ listing rules, and are not subject to NASDAQ requirements that would otherwise require us to have a majority of independent directors, a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors. Accordingly, our stockholders will not be afforded the same protections generally as stockholders of other NASDAQ-listed companies with respect to corporate governance for so long as we rely on these exemptions from the corporate governance requirements.17Table of ContentsIn addition, our certificate of incorporation and the Stockholder’s Agreement restrict us from taking certain actions without Deutsche Telekom’s prior written consent as long as Deutsche Telekom beneficially owns 30% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including:•the incurrence of debt (excluding certain permitted debt) if our consolidated ratio of debt to cash flow, as defined in the indenture dated April 28, 2013, for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available would exceed 5.25 to 1.0 on a pro forma basis;•the acquisition of any business, debt or equity interests, operations or assets of any person for consideration in excess of $1.0 billion;•the sale of any of our or our subsidiaries’ divisions, businesses, operations or equity interests for consideration in excess of $1.0 billion;•the incurrence of secured debt (excluding certain permitted secured debt);•any change in the size of our Board of Directors;•the issuances of equity securities in excess of 10% of our outstanding shares or to repurchase debt held by Deutsche Telekom;•the repurchase or redemption of equity securities or the declaration of extraordinary or in-kind dividends or distributions other than on a pro rata basis; or•the termination or hiring of our chief executive officer.These restrictions could prevent us from taking actions that our Board of Directors may otherwise determine are in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders or that may be in the best interests of our other stockholders.Deutsche Telekom effectively has control over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, changes to our certificate of incorporation, a sale or merger of our Company and other transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law. Deutsche Telekom’s controlling interest may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, the Company. Deutsche Telekom may have strategic, financial, or other interests different from our other stockholders, including as the holder of a substantial amount of our indebtedness and as the counter-party in a number of commercial arrangements, and may make decisions adverse to the interests of our other stockholders.In addition, we license certain trademarks from Deutsche Telekom, including the right to use the trademark “T-Mobile” as a name for the Company and our flagship brand, under a trademark license agreement between Deutsche Telekom and the Company. As described in more detail in our proxy statement under the heading “Transactions with Related Persons and Approval”, we are obligated under the trademark license to pay Deutsche Telekom a royalty in an amount equal to 0.25%, which we refer to as the royalty rate, of the net revenue (as defined in the trademark license) generated by products and services sold by the Company under the licensed trademarks. However, the license agreement includes a royalty rate adjustment mechanism that will occur in early 2018 and potentially result in a new royalty rate effective in January 2019. We also have the right to terminate the trademark license upon one year’s prior notice. An increase in the royalty rate or termination of the trademark license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Future sales or issuances of our common stock, including sales by Deutsche Telekom, could have a negative impact on our stock price.We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares or the availability of shares of our common stock will have on the prevailing trading price of our common stock from time to time. Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline and could result in dilution of your shares.We and Deutsche Telekom are parties to the Stockholder’s Agreement pursuant to which Deutsche Telekom is free to transfer its shares in public sales without notice, as long as such transactions would not result in the transferee owning 30% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If a transfer would exceed the 30% threshold, it is prohibited unless the transferee makes a binding offer to purchase all of the other outstanding shares on the same price and terms. The Stockholder’s Agreement does not otherwise impose any other restrictions on the sales of common stock by Deutsche Telekom. Moreover, we have filed a shelf registration statement with respect to the common stock and certain debt securities held by Deutsche Telekom, which would facilitate the resale by Deutsche Telekom of all or any portion of the shares of our common stock it holds. The sale of shares of our common stock by Deutsche Telekom (other than in transactions involving the purchase of all of our outstanding shares) could significantly increase the number of shares available in the market, which could cause a decrease 18Table of Contentsin our stock price. In addition, even if Deutsche Telekom does not sell a large number of its shares into the market, its right to transfer a large number of shares into the market may depress our stock price.Our stock price may be volatile, and may fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results. The trading prices of the securities of communications companies historically have been highly volatile, and the trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations. Our stock price may fluctuate in reaction to a number of events and factors that may include, among other things:•our or our competitors’ actual or anticipated operating and financial results; introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors or changes in service plans or pricing by us or our competitors;•analyst projections, predictions and forecasts, analyst target prices for our securities and changes in, or our failure to meet, securities analysts’ expectations;•transaction in our common stock by major investors;•share repurchases by us or purchases by Deutsche Telekom;•Deutsche Telekom’s financial performance, results of operation, or actions implied or taken by Deutsche Telekom;•entry of new competitors into our markets or perceptions of increased price competition, including a price war;•our performance, including subscriber growth, and our financial and operational metric performance;•market perceptions relating to our services, network, handsets, and deployment of our LTE platform and our access to iconic handsets, services, applications, or content;•market perceptions of the wireless communications industry and valuation models for us and the industry;•conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry sectors we operate in;•changes in our credit rating or future prospects;•changes in interest rates;•changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;•the availability or perceived availability of additional capital in general and our access to such capital;•actual or anticipated consolidation, or other strategic mergers or acquisition activities involving us or our competitors, or other participants in related or adjacent industries, or market speculations regarding such activities;•disruptions of our operations or service providers or other vendors necessary to our network operations; •the general state of the U.S. and world politics and economies; and•availability of additional spectrum, whether by the announcement, commencement, bidding and closing of auctions for new spectrum or the acquisition of companies that own spectrum, and the extent to which we or our competitors succeed in acquiring additional spectrum.In addition, the stock market has been volatile in the recent past and has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which may continue for the foreseeable future. This volatility has had a significant impact on the trading price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in the communications industry. These changes frequently occur irrespective of the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the trading price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results. We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our credit facilities and the indentures and supplemental indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to use future earnings, if any, to invest in our business and to fund our existing stock repurchase program.19Table of ContentsOur previously announced stock repurchase program, and any subsequent stock purchase program put in place from time to time, could affect the price of our common stock, increase the volatility of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves. Such repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. We may have in place from time to time, a stock repurchase program. Any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under any such stock repurchase program depends on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows, the price of our common stock, corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions. We may effect repurchases under any stock repurchase program from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including accelerated stock repurchase arrangements. Repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness. Additionally, our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket InformationOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “TMUS.” As of December 31, 2017, there were 269 registered stockholders of record of our common stock, but we estimate the total number of stockholders to be much higher as a number of our shares are held by brokers or dealers for their customers in street name.The high and low common stock sales prices per share were as follows: High LowYear Ended December 31, 2017 First quarter$65.41 $55.30Second quarter68.88 59.59Third quarter65.47 59.13Fourth quarter64.64 54.60Year Ended December 31, 2016 First quarter$41.23 $33.23Second quarter44.13 37.93Third quarter48.11 42.71Fourth quarter59.19 44.91DividendsWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our credit facilities and the indentures and supplemental indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. In addition, no dividend may be declared or paid on our common stock, other than dividends payable solely in shares of our common stock, unless all accrued dividends for all completed dividend periods have been declared and paid on our preferred stock. As of December 15, 2017, 20 million shares of our preferred stock converted to approximately 32 million shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 1.6119 common shares for each share of previously outstanding preferred stock and certain cash-in-lieu of fractional shares. There are no preferred shares outstanding as of December 31, 2017. We currently intend to use future earnings, if any, to invest in our business and to fund our existing stock repurchase program. Subject to Delaware law, our Board of Directors will determine the payment of future dividends on our common stock, if any, and the amount of any dividends in light of:•any applicable contractual or charter restrictions limiting our ability to pay dividends;•our earnings and cash flows;•our capital requirements;•our future needs for cash;•our financial condition; and•other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.21Table of ContentsRepurchases of Common StockOn December 6, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of our common stock through December 31, 2018. Under the repurchase program, repurchases can be made from time to time using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, all in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other applicable legal requirements. The specific timing, price and size of purchases will depend on prevailing stock prices, general economic and market conditions, and other considerations. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. Repurchased shares are retired. We also understand that Deutsche Telekom AG, our majority stockholder, or its affiliates, is considering plans to purchase additional shares of our common stock. Such purchases would likely take place through December 31, 2018, all in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other applicable legal requirements.The following table summarizes information regarding shares repurchased during the quarter ended December 31, 2017: Total Number of Shares Repurchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Repurchase Plans or Programs Maximum Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (in millions)10/1/2017 - 10/31/2017— $— — $—11/1/2017 - 11/30/2017— — — —12/1/2017 - 12/31/20177,010,889 63.34 7,010,889 1,056 7,010,889 7,010,889 1,056From the inception of the repurchase program through February 5, 2018, we repurchased approximately 12.3 million shares at an average price per share of $63.68 for a total purchase price of approximately $783 million.

The imputed discount on Equipment Installment Plan (“EIP”) receivables, which is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method, and was previously presented within Interest income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, is now presented within Other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. We have applied this change retrospectively and presented the effect of $280 million, $248 million, $414 million, $356 million and $185 million on the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively in the table above. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.(2)We believe current and future regulatory changes have made the Lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical. We will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the Lifeline program, but have excluded the Lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 4,528,000 reported wholesale customers in 2017.24Table of ContentsItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewThe objectives of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) are to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with the following:•A narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results;•Context to the financial statements; and•Information that allows assessment of the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.Our MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our audited consolidated financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2017 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our MD&A are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.Business OverviewChange in Accounting PrincipleEffective January 1, 2017, the imputed discount on EIP receivables, which is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and was previously recognized within Interest income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, is recognized within Other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. We believe this presentation is preferable because it provides a better representation of amounts earned from the Company’s major ongoing operations and aligns with industry practice thereby enhancing comparability. We have applied this change retrospectively and the effect of this change for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, was a reclassification of $248 million and $414 million, respectively, from Interest income to Other revenues. The amortization of imputed discount on our EIP receivables for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $280 million. For additional information, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Un-carrier StrategyThe Un-carrier is about adding value to the customer relationship by changing the rules of the industry and giving our customers more. We introduced our Un-carrier strategy in 2013 with the objective of eliminating customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry. Since that time, we have continued our efforts with the launch of additional initiatives of our Un-carrier strategy. During 2017, we launched the following Un-carrier initiatives:•In January 2017, we introduced, Un-carrier Next, where monthly wireless service fees and sales taxes are included in the advertised monthly recurring charge for T-Mobile ONE. We also unveiled Kickback on T-Mobile ONE, where participating customers who use 2 GB or less of data in a month, will get up to a $10 credit per qualifying line on their next month’s bill. In addition, we introduced the Un-contract for T-Mobile ONE with the first-ever price guarantee on an unlimited 4G LTE plan which allows current T-Mobile ONE customers to keep their price for service until they decide to change it.•In September 2017, we introduced, Un-carrier Next: Netflix On Us, through an exclusive new partnership with Netflix where qualifying T-Mobile ONE customers on family plans can opt in for a standard monthly Netflix service plan at no additional cost.Our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues and we believe our Un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved branded postpaid phone and branded prepaid customer churn.25Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2017 Versus 2016 2016 Versus 2015(in thousands)2017 2016 2015# Change % Change # Change % ChangeNet customer additions Branded postpaid customers3,620 4,097 4,510 (477) (12)% (413) (9)%Branded prepaid customers855 2,508 1,315 (1,653) (66)% 1,193 91 %Total branded customers4,475 6,605 5,825 (2,130) (32)% 780 13 % Year Ended December 31, Bps Change 2017 Versus 2016 Bps Change 2016 Versus 20152017 2016 2015 Branded postpaid phone churn1.18% 1.30% 1.39% -12 bps -9 bpsBranded prepaid churn4.04% 3.88% 4.45% 16 bps -57 bpsOn September 1, 2016, we sold our marketing and distribution rights to certain existing T-Mobile co-branded customers to a current MVNO partner for nominal consideration (the “MVNO Transaction”). Upon the sale, the MVNO Transaction resulted in a transfer of 1,365,000 branded postpaid phone customers and 326,000 branded prepaid customers to wholesale customers. Prospectively from September 1, 2016, revenue for these customers is recorded within wholesale revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Additionally, the impact of the MVNO Transaction resulted in improvements to branded postpaid phone churn for year ended December 31, 2016.We believe current and future regulatory changes have made the Lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical. We will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the Lifeline program, but have excluded the Lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 4,528,000 reported wholesale customers in 2017.During the year ended December 31, 2016, a handset OEM announced recalls on certain of its smartphone devices. As a result, in 2016 we recorded no revenue associated with the device sales to customers and impaired the devices to their net realizable value. The OEM agreed to reimburse T-Mobile for direct and indirect costs associated with the recall, as such, we recorded an amount due from the OEM as an offset to the loss recorded in Cost of equipment sales and the costs incurred within Selling, general and administrative in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and a reduction to Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The reimbursement was received from the OEM in 2017.26Table of ContentsHurricane ImpactsDuring the third and fourth quarters of 2017, our operations in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico experienced losses related to hurricanes. The impact to operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017, from lost revenue, assets damaged or destroyed and other hurricane related costs are included in the table below. We expect additional expenses to be incurred and customer activity to be impacted in the first quarter of 2018, primarily related to our operations in Puerto Rico. We have recognized insurance recoveries related to those hurricane losses in the amount of approximately $93 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as an offset to the costs incurred within Cost of services in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and as an increase to Other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We continue to assess the damage of the hurricanes and work with our insurance carriers to submit claims for property damage and business interruption. We expect to record additional insurance recoveries related to these hurricanes in future periods.(in millions, except per share amounts, ARPU, ABPU, and bad debt expense as a percentage of total revenues)Year Ended December 31, 2017Gross Reimbursement NetIncrease (decrease) Revenues Branded postpaid revenues$(37) $— $(37)Of which, branded postpaid phone revenues(35) — (35)Branded prepaid revenues(11) — (11)Total service revenues(48) — (48)Equipment revenues(8) — (8)Total revenues(56) — (56) Operating expenses Cost of services198 (93) 105Cost of equipment sales4 — 4Selling, general and administrative36 — 36Of which, bad debt expense20 — 20Total operating expense238 (93) 145 Operating income (loss)$(294) $93 $(201)Net income (loss)$(193) $63 $(130) Earnings per share - basic$(0.23) $0.07 $(0.16)Earnings per share - diluted(0.22) 0.07 (0.15) Operating measures Bad debt expense as a percentage of total revenues0.05% —% 0.05%Branded postpaid phone ARPU$(0.09) $— $(0.09)Branded postpaid ABPU(0.08) — (0.08)Branded prepaid ARPU(0.05) — (0.05) Non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted EBITDA$(294) $93 $(201)27Table of ContentsResults of OperationsHighlights for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016•Total revenues of $40.6 billion increased $3.1 billion, or 8%. The increase was primarily driven by growth in service and equipment revenues as further discussed below. On September 1, 2016, we sold our marketing and distribution rights to certain existing T-Mobile co-branded customers to a current MVNO partner for nominal consideration. The MVNO Transaction shifted Branded postpaid revenues to Wholesale revenues, but did not materially impact total revenues.•Service revenues of $30.2 billion increased $2.3 billion, or 8%. The increase was primarily due to growth in our average branded customer base as a result of strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives, promotions and the success of our MetroPCS brand. •Equipment revenues of $9.4 billion increased $648 million, or 7%. The increase was primarily due to higher average revenue per device sold and an increase from customer purchases of leased devices at the end of the lease term, partially offset by lower lease revenues. •Operating income of $4.9 billion increased $838 million, or 21%. The increase was primarily due to higher Total service revenues and lower Depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher Selling, general and administrative, lower Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses and higher Cost of services expenses.•Net income of $4.5 billion increased $3.1 billion, or 211%. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""TCJA""), which resulted in a net tax benefit of $2.2 billion in 2017, and higher operating income driven by the factors described above, partially offset by the negative impact from hurricanes. Net income included net, after-tax spectrum gains of $174 million and $509 million, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.•Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, of $11.2 billion increased $574 million, or 5%. The increase was primarily due to higher operating income driven by the factors described above, partially offset by lower Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses. Adjusted EBITDA included pre-tax spectrum gains of $235 million and $835 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. •Net cash provided by operating activities of $8.0 billion increased $1.8 billion, or 30%. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for additional information.•Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, of $2.7 billion increased $1.3 billion, or 90%.

Device sales revenue is recognized at the time of sale;•An increase of $395 million from customers' purchase of leased devices at the end of the lease term; •An increase of $231 million primarily related to proceeds from liquidation of returned customer handsets in 2017; and•An increase of $130 million in SIM and upgrade revenue; partially offset by •A decrease of $539 million in lease revenues from declining JUMP! On Demand population due to shifting focus to our EIP financing option beginning in the first quarter of 2016;•A decrease of $18 million in accessory revenue primarily related to the decrease in device sales volume; and•The negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $8 million.Under our JUMP! On Demand program, upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. Revenue for purchased leased devices is recorded as equipment revenues when revenue recognition criteria have been met.Gross EIP device financing to our customers increased by $437 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to growth in the gross amount of equipment financed on EIP. The increase was also due to certain customers on leased devices reaching the end of lease term who financed their devices over a nine-month EIP. Other revenues increased $150 million, or 16%, primarily due to higher revenue from revenue share agreements with third parties.30Table of ContentsOur operating expenses consist of the following categories:•Cost of services primarily includes costs directly attributable to providing wireless service through the operation of our network, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, network access and transport costs, utilities, maintenance, associated labor costs, long distance costs, regulatory program costs, roaming fees paid to other carriers and data content costs.•Cost of equipment sales primarily includes costs of devices and accessories sold to customers and dealers, device costs to fulfill insurance and warranty claims, costs related to returned and purchased leased devices, write-downs of inventory related to shrinkage and obsolescence, and shipping and handling costs.•Selling, general and administrative primarily includes costs not directly attributable to providing wireless service for the operation of sales, customer care and corporate activities. These include commissions paid to dealers and retail employees for activations and upgrades, labor and facilities costs associated with retail sales force and administrative space, marketing and promotional costs, customer support and billing, bad debt expense, losses from sales of receivables and back office administrative support activities.Operating expenses increased $2.3 billion, or 7%, primarily from higher Cost of services, Cost of equipment sales, Selling, general and administrative and lower Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses, partially offset by lower Depreciation and amortization as discussed below.Cost of services increased $369 million, or 6%, primarily from:•Higher lease, engineering and employee-related expenses associated with network expansion; and•The negative impact from hurricanes of $105 million, net of insurance recoveries; partially offset by•Lower long distance and toll costs as we continue to renegotiate contracts with vendors; and•Lower regulatory expenses.Cost of equipment sales increased $789 million, or 7%, primarily from:•An increase of $806 million in device cost of equipment sales, excluding purchased leased devices, primarily due to: •A higher average cost per device sold primarily from an increase in the high-end device mix and from the impact of an OEM recall of its smartphone devices in 2016; partially offset by •A 2% decrease in the number of devices sold, excluding purchased lease devices, driven by a lower branded postpaid handset upgrade rate. •An increase of $201 million in lease device cost of equipment sales, primarily due to: •An increase in lease buyouts as leases began reaching their term dates in 2017; partially offset by •A decrease in write downs to market value of devices returned to inventory resulting from a decrease in the number of leased device upgrades.•These increases are partially offset by a decrease of $159 million primarily related to:•A decrease in insurance and warranty claims;•Higher proceeds from liquidation of returned customer handsets under our insurance programs; and •Lower inventory adjustments related to physical adjustments and obsolete inventory; partially offset by•Higher costs from an increase in the volume of liquidated returned customer handsets outside of our insurance programs.•A decrease of $57 million in accessory cost primarily driven by the decrease in device sales volume.Under our JUMP! On Demand program, upon device upgrade or at the end of the lease term, customers must return or purchase their device. The cost of purchased leased devices is recorded as Cost of equipment sales. Returned devices transferred from Property and equipment, net are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write-down to market recognized as Cost of equipment sales.31Table of ContentsSelling, general and administrative increased $881 million, or 8%, primarily from higher commissions, employee-related costs, promotional and advertising costs, and costs related to outsourced functions and managed services to support our growing customer base, partially offset by lower handset repair services cost. Additionally, the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $36 million contributed to the increase.Depreciation and amortization decreased $259 million, or 4%, primarily from:•Lower depreciation expense related to our JUMP! On Demand program resulting from a lower number of devices under lease. Under our JUMP! On Demand program, the cost of a leased wireless device is depreciated to its estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to us; partially offset by•The continued build-out of our 4G LTE network;•The implementation of the first component of our new billing system; and •Growth in our distribution footprint.Cost of MetroPCS business combination decreased $104 million. On July 1, 2015, we officially completed the shutdown of the MetroPCS CDMA network. Network decommissioning costs primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. We do not expect to incur significant additional network decommissioning costs in 2018.Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses decreased $600 million, or 72%, primarily from gains of $636 million and $191 million on disposal of spectrum licenses with AT&T and Sprint during the first quarter and third quarter of 2016, respectively. These 2016 gains were partially offset by gains of $235 million from spectrum license transactions with AT&T and Verizon in 2017.Net income increased $3.1 billion, primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (""TCJA"") as discussed below, higher operating income and a net decrease in interest expense, partially offset by the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $130 million, net of insurance recoveries.•Operating income, the components of which are discussed above, increased $838 million, or 21%. The negative impact from the hurricanes for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $201 million, net of insurance recoveries. •Income tax benefit (expense) changed $2.2 billion, from an expense of $867 million in 2016 to a benefit of $1.4 billion in 2017 primarily from:•A lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was a benefit of 43.5% in 2017, compared to an expense of 37.3% in 2016. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the TCJA, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $2.2 billion in 2017, substantially due to a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities; and•A $319 million reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in certain state jurisdictions in 2017; partially offset by•Higher income before income taxes. The TCJA was enacted December 22, 2017 and is generally effective beginning January 1, 2018. The TCJA includes numerous changes to existing tax law, which have been reflected in the 2017 consolidated financial statements. The state corporate income tax impact of the TCJA is complex and will continue to evolve as jurisdictions evaluate conformity to the numerous federal tax law changes. As such, a re-measurement of state deferred tax assets and liabilities and the associated net tax benefit or expense may result within the next 12 months. The TCJA resulted in a net tax benefit of $2.2 billion in 2017. See Note 11 - Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.•Interest expense decreased $307 million, or 22%, primarily from: •A decrease from the early redemption of our $1.98 billion Senior Secured Term Loans and $8.3 billion of Senior Notes; partially offset by 32Table of Contents•An increase from the issuance of the $1.5 billion of Senior Notes in March 2017; and •An increase from the issuance of the $1.0 billion of Senior Notes in April 2016. •Interest expense to affiliates increased $248 million, or 79%, primarily from: •Issuance of $4.0 billion secured term loan facility with Deutsche Telekom AG (""DT"") entered into in January 2017;•Issuance of a total of $4.0 billion in Senior Notes in May 2017;•An increase in drawings on our Revolving Credit Facility; and •Issuance of $500 million in Senior Notes in September 2017; partially offset by•A decrease from lower interest rates achieved through refinancing of a total of $2.5 billion of Senior Reset Notes in April 2017.See Note 7 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.•Other expense, net increased $67 million primarily from:•A $73 million net loss recognized from the early redemption of certain Senior Notes; and •A $13 million net loss recognized from the refinancing of our outstanding Senior Secured Term Loans.See Note 7 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Net income included net, after-tax gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $174 million and $509 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Guarantor SubsidiariesThe financial condition and results of operations of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries is substantially similar to our consolidated financial condition.

See Note 16 – Guarantor Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.The following discussion and analysis is for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 unless otherwise stated.Certain prior year amounts relating to the change in accounting principle which presents the imputed discount on EIP receivables, which is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method, and was previously presented within Interest income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, is now presented within Other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Total revenues increased $5.0 billion, or 15%, primarily due to:Branded postpaid revenues increased $1.8 billion, or 11%, primarily from:•A 13% increase in the number of average branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers, driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices;•Higher device insurance program revenues primarily from customer growth; and•Higher regulatory program revenues; partially offset by•An increase in the non-cash net revenue deferral for Data Stash; and •The MVNO Transaction.Branded prepaid revenues increased $1.0 billion, or 13%, primarily from:•A 13% increase in the number of average branded prepaid customers driven by the success of our MetroPCS brand; and•Continued growth in new markets.Wholesale revenues increased $211 million, or 30%, primarily from:•The MVNO Transaction;•Growth in customers of certain MVNO partners; and •An increase in data usage per customer.Roaming and other service revenues increased $57 million, or 30%, primarily due to higher international roaming revenues driven by an increase in inbound roaming volumes.Equipment revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 30%, primarily from:•An increase of $1.2 billion in lease revenues resulting from the launch of our JUMP! On Demand program at the end of the second quarter of 2015. Revenues associated with leased devices are recognized over the lease term; and•An increase of $570 million in device sales revenues, primarily due to a 9% increase in the number of devices sold. Device sales revenue is recognized at the time of sale.Gross EIP device financing to our customers increased by $923 million to $6.1 billion primarily due to an increase in devices financed due to our focus on EIP sales in 2016, compared to focus on devices financed on JUMP! On Demand after the launch of the program at the end of the second quarter of 2015.34Table of ContentsOther revenues decreased $9 million, or 1%, primarily due to:•An increase in sales of certain EIP receivables pursuant to our EIP receivables sales arrangement resulting from an increase in the maximum funding commitment in June 2016. Interest associated with EIP receivables is imputed at the time of a device sale and then recognized over the financed installment term. See Note 2 - Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information; and •Focus on devices financed on JUMP! On Demand in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 following the launch of the program of at the end of the second quarter 2015; partially offset by •Higher revenue from revenue share agreements with third parties; and•An increase in co-location rental income from leasing space on wireless communication towers to third parties. Operating expenses increased $3.5 billion, or 12%, primarily due to:Cost of services increased $177 million, or 3%, primarily from:•Higher regulatory program costs and expenses associated with network expansion and the build-out of our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses, including higher employee-related costs; partially offset by •Lower long distance and toll costs; and•Synergies realized from the decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network.Cost of equipment sales increased $1.5 billion, or 16%, primarily from:•A 9% increase in the number of devices sold; and•An increase in the impact from returned and purchased leased devices.Under our JUMP! On Demand program, the cost of the leased wireless device is capitalized and recognized as depreciation expense over the term of the lease rather than recognized as cost of equipment sales when the device is delivered to the customer. Additionally, upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. Returned devices transferred from Property and equipment, net are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write-down to market recognized as Cost of equipment sales.Selling, general and administrative increased $1.2 billion, or 12%, primarily from strategic investments to support our growing customer base including higher:•Employee-related costs;•Commissions driven by an increase in branded customer additions; and •Promotional costs.Depreciation and amortization increased $1.6 billion, or 33%, primarily from:•$1.5 billion in depreciation expense related to devices leased under our JUMP! On Demand program launched at the end of the second quarter of 2015. Under our JUMP! On Demand program, the cost of a leased wireless device is depreciated over the lease term to its estimated residual value. The total number of devices under lease was higher year-over-year, resulting in higher depreciation expense; and •The continued build-out of our 4G LTE network.Cost of MetroPCS business combination decreased $272 million, or 72%, primarily from lower network decommissioning costs. In 2014, we began decommissioning the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant network cell sites as part of the business combination. On July 1, 2015, we officially completed the shutdown of the MetroPCS CDMA network. Network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites.Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses increased $672 million primarily from a $636 million gain from a spectrum license transaction with AT&T recorded in the first quarter of 2016 and $199 million from other transactions in 2016, compared to 35Table of Contents$163 million in 2015. See Note 5 – Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Net income increased $727 million, or 99%, primarily from:•Operating income, the components of which are discussed above, increased $1.6 billion, or 63%.•Interest expense to affiliates decreased $99 million, or 24%, primarily from:•Changes in the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with our Senior Reset Notes issued to Deutsch Telekom in 2015; partially offset by•Higher interest rates on certain Senior Reset Notes issued to Deutsch Telekom, which were adjusted at reset dates in the second quarter of 2016 and in 2015. •Income tax expense increased $622 million, or 254%, primarily from:•Higher income before income taxes; and•A higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was 37.3% in 2016, compared to 25.1% in 2015. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to income tax benefits for discrete income tax items recognized in 2015 that did not impact 2016; partially offset by the recognition of $58 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments following the adoption of ASU 2016-09 as of January 1, 2016.•Interest expense increased $333 million, or 31%, primarily from:•Higher average debt balances with third parties; and•Lower capitalized interest costs of $83 million primarily due to a higher level of build out of our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses in 2015, compared to 2016.Net income during 2016 and 2015 included net, after-tax gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $509 million and $100 million, respectively.Guarantor SubsidiariesThe financial condition and results of operations of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries is substantially similar to our consolidated financial condition.The most significant components of the financial condition of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries were as follows: December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Change(in millions)$ %Other current assets$565 $400 $165 41 %Property and equipment, net375 454 (79) (17)%Tower obligations2,221 2,247 (26) (1)%Total stockholders' deficit(1,374) (1,359) (15) (1)%The most significant components of the results of operations of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Change(in millions)2016 2015$ %Service revenues$2,023 $1,669 $354 21 %Cost of equipment sales1,027 720 307 43 %Selling, general and administrative868 733 135 18 %Total comprehensive income24 60 (36) (60)%The change to the results of operations of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries was primarily from the increases in Service revenues, Cost of equipment sales and Selling, general and administrative were primarily the result of an increase in activity of the non-guarantor subsidiary that provides device insurance, primarily driven by growth in our customer base.

See Note 16 – Guarantor Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Performance MeasuresIn managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures. These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry on key operating and financial measures.Total CustomersA customer is generally defined as a SIM number with a unique T-Mobile identifier which is associated with an account that generates revenue. Branded customers generally include customers that are qualified either for postpaid service utilizing phones, mobile broadband devices (including tablets), or DIGITS, where they generally pay after receiving service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance. Wholesale customers include M2M and MVNO customers that operate on our network, but are managed by wholesale partners.The following table sets forth the number of ending customers: December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 2017 Versus 2016 2016 Versus 2015(in thousands)# Change % Change# Change % ChangeCustomers, end of period Branded postpaid phone customers (1)34,114 31,297 29,355 2,817 9 % 1,942 7%Branded postpaid other customers (1)3,933 3,130 2,340 803 26 % 790 34%Total branded postpaid customers38,047 34,427 31,695 3,620 11 % 2,732 9%Branded prepaid customers20,668 19,813 17,631 855 4 % 2,182 12%Total branded customers58,715 54,240 49,326 4,475 8 % 4,914 10%Wholesale customers (2)13,870 17,215 13,956 (3,345) (19)% 3,259 23%Total customers, end of period72,585 71,455 63,282 1,130 2 % 8,173 13%Adjustments to branded postpaid phone customers (3)— (1,365) — 1,365 (100)% (1,365) NMAdjustments to branded prepaid customers (3)— (326) — 326 (100)% (326) NMAdjustments to wholesale customers (3)— 1,691 — (1,691) (100)% 1,691 NMNM - Not Meaningful(1)During 2017, we retitled our “Branded postpaid mobile broadband customers” category to “Branded postpaid other customers” and reclassified DIGITS customers from our “Branded postpaid phone customers” category for the second quarter of 2017, when the DIGITS product was released.(2)We believe current and future regulatory changes have made the Lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical. We will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the Lifeline program, but have excluded the Lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 4,528,000 reported wholesale customers in 2017.(3)The MVNO Transaction resulted in a transfer of Branded postpaid phone customers and Branded prepaid customers to Wholesale customers on September 1, 2016. Prospectively from September 1, 2016, net customer additions for these customers are included within Wholesale customers.Branded Customers Total branded customers increased 4,475,000, or 8%, in 2017 primarily from:•Higher branded postpaid phone customers driven by the continued strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and promotional activities, the growing success of our business channel, T-Mobile for Business, continued growth in existing markets and distribution expansion to new Greenfield markets, and lower churn, partially offset by increased competitive activity in the marketplace with all competitors having launched Unlimited rate plans in the first quarter of 2017; •Higher branded prepaid customers driven by the continued success of our Metro PCS brand and continued growth from distribution expansion, partially offset by the optimization of our third-party distribution channels; and •Higher branded postpaid other customers primarily due to higher connected devices and DIGITS. 37Table of ContentsTotal branded customers increased 4,914,000, or 10%, in 2016 primarily from:•Higher branded prepaid customers driven by the success of our MetroPCS brand, continued growth in new markets and distribution expansion, partially offset by the optimization of our third-party distribution channels; and•Higher branded postpaid customers driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and promotional activities, partially offset by higher deactivations on a growing customer base.WholesaleWholesale customers decreased 3,345,000, or 19%, primarily due to Lifeline subscribers, which were excluded from our reported wholesale subscriber base as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. This decrease was partially offset by the continued success of our M2M partnerships.Wholesale customers increased 3,259,000, or 23%, in 2016 primarily due the continued success of our M2M partnerships and the MVNO transaction.Net Customer AdditionsThe following table sets forth the number of net customer additions: Year Ended December 31, 2017 Versus 2016 2016 Versus 2015(in thousands)2017 2016 2015# Change % Change# Change % ChangeNet customer additions Branded postpaid phone customers (1)2,817 3,307 3,511 (490) (15)% (204) (6)%Branded postpaid other customers (1)803 790 999 13 2 % (209) (21)%Total branded postpaid customers3,620 4,097 4,510 (477) (12)% (413) (9)%Branded prepaid customers855 2,508 1,315 (1,653) (66)% 1,193 91 %Total branded customers4,475 6,605 5,825 (2,130) (32)% 780 13 %Wholesale customers (2)1,183 1,568 2,439 (385) (25)% (871) (36)%Total net customer additions5,658 8,173 8,264 (2,515) (31)% (91) (1)%(1)During 2017, we retitled our “Branded postpaid mobile broadband customers” category to “Branded postpaid other customers” and reclassified DIGITS customer net additions from our “Branded postpaid phone customers” category for the second quarter of 2017, when the DIGITS product was released.(2)Net customer activity for Lifeline was excluded beginning in the second quarter of 2017 due to our determination based upon changes in the applicable government regulations that the Lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners is uneconomical.Branded CustomersTotal branded net customer additions decreased 2,130,000, or 32%, in 2017 primarily from:•Lower branded prepaid net customer additions primarily due to higher deactivations from a growing customer base, increased competitive activity in the marketplace and de-emphasis of the T-Mobile prepaid brand. Additional decreases resulted from the optimization of our third-party distribution channels; and•Lower branded postpaid phone net customer additions primarily due to increased competitive activity in the marketplace partially offset by the continued strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and promotional activities, the growing success of our business channel, T-Mobile for Business, continued growth in new markets and distribution expansion to new Greenfield markets, and lower churn; partially offset by•Higher branded postpaid other net customer additions primarily due to higher gross customer additions from connected devices and DIGITS, offset by higher deactivations from a growing customer base.Total branded net customer additions increased 780,000, or 13%, in 2016 primarily from:•Higher branded prepaid net customer additions primarily due to the success of our MetroPCS brand, continued growth in new markets and distribution expansion, partially offset by an increase in the number of qualified branded prepaid customers migrating to branded postpaid plans; partially offset by•Lower branded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions primarily due to higher deactivations resulting from churn on a growing branded postpaid mobile broadband customer base, partially offset by higher gross customer 38Table of Contentsadditions; and•Lower branded postpaid phone net customer additions primarily due to lower gross customer additions from higher deactivations on a growing customer base, partially offset by lower churn as well as an increase in the number of qualified branded prepaid customers migrating to branded postpaid plans as well as the optimization of our third-party distribution channels.WholesaleWholesale net customer additions decreased 385,000, or 25%, in 2017 primarily from lower gross customer additions, partially offset by lower deactivations driven by the removal of the Lifeline program customers. While we continue to focus on more profitable wholesale opportunities, we believe current and future regulatory changes have made the Lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical. We will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the Lifeline program, but have excluded the Lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 4,528,000 reported wholesale customers in 2017.Wholesale net customer additions decreased 871,000, or 36%, in 2016 primarily due to higher MVNO deactivations from certain MVNO partners.Customers Per AccountCustomers per account is calculated by dividing the number of branded postpaid customers as of the end of the period by the number of branded postpaid accounts as of the end of the period. An account may include branded postpaid phone, mobile broadband, and DIGITS customers. We believe branded postpaid customers per account provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate our branded postpaid customer base on a per account basis.

We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue realization per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. Branded postpaid phone ARPU excludes mobile broadband and DIGITS customers and related revenues.Average Billings Per User (“ABPU”) represents the average monthly customer billings, including monthly lease revenues and EIP billings before securitization, per customer. We believe branded postpaid ABPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate average branded postpaid customer billings as it is indicative of estimated cash collections, including device financing payments, from our customers each month.The following tables illustrate the calculation of our operating measures ARPU and ABPU and reconcile these measures to the related service revenues:(in millions, except average number of customers, ARPU and ABPU) Year Ended December 31, 2017 Versus 2016 2016 Versus 20152017 2016 2015$ Change % Change$ Change % ChangeCalculation of Branded Postpaid Phone ARPU Branded postpaid service revenues$19,448 $18,138 $16,383 $1,310 7 % $1,755 11 %Less: Branded postpaid other revenues(1,077) (773) (588) (304) 39 % (185) 31 %Branded postpaid phone service revenues$18,371 $17,365 $15,795 $1,006 6 % $1,570 10 %Divided by: Average number of branded postpaid phone customers (in thousands) and number of months in period32,596 30,484 27,604 2,112 7 % 2,880 10 %Branded postpaid phone ARPU (1)$46.97 $47.47 $47.68 $(0.50) (1)% $(0.21) — % Calculation of Branded Postpaid ABPU Branded postpaid service revenues$19,448 $18,138 $16,383 $1,310 7 % $1,755 11 %EIP billings5,866 5,432 5,494 434 8 % (62) (1)%Lease revenues877 1,416 224 (539) (38)% 1,192 532 %Total billings for branded postpaid customers$26,191 $24,986 $22,101 $1,205 5 % $2,885 13 %Divided by: Average number of branded postpaid customers (in thousands) and number of months in period36,079 33,184 29,341 2,895 9 % 3,843 13 %Branded postpaid ABPU$60.49 $62.75 $62.77 $(2.26) (4)% $(0.02) — % Calculation of Branded Prepaid ARPU Branded prepaid service revenues$9,380 $8,553 $7,553 $827 10 % $1,000 13 %Divided by: Average number of branded prepaid customers (in thousands) and number of months in period20,204 18,797 16,704 1,407 7 % 2,093 13 %Branded prepaid ARPU$38.69 $37.92 $37.68 $0.77 2 % $0.24 1 %(1) Branded postpaid phone ARPU includes the reclassification of 43,000 DIGITS average customers and related revenue to the “Branded postpaid other customers” category for the second quarter of 2017.40Table of ContentsBranded Postpaid Phone ARPUBranded postpaid phone ARPU decreased $0.50, or 1%, in 2017 primarily from:•Dilution from promotions targeting families and new segments; and •The negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $0.09; partially offset by•The MVNO Transaction as those customers had a lower ARPU; and•A decrease in the non-cash net revenue deferral for Data Stash.Under existing revenue standards, T-Mobile continues to expect that Branded postpaid phone ARPU in full-year 2018 will be generally stable compared to full-year 2017, with some quarterly variations.We adopted ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU 2014-09”), as amended, on January 1, 2018. Adoption of the standard will impact the timing, amount and allocation of our revenue and is expected to impact ARPU. We will provide additional disclosures comparing results to previous GAAP in our 2018 consolidated financial statements.

Net income margin represents Net income divided by Service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues.Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a metric to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, network decommissioning costs as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance and certain other nonrecurring income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).The following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure: Year Ended December 31, 2017 Versus 2016 2016 Versus 2015(in millions)2017 2016 2015$ Change % Change$ Change % ChangeNet income$4,536 $1,460 $733 $3,076 211 % $727 99 %Adjustments: Interest expense1,111 1,418 1,085 (307) (22)% 333 31 %Interest expense to affiliates560 312 411 248 79 % (99) (24)%Interest income (1)(17) (13) (6) (4) 31 % (7) 117 %Other (income) expense, net73 6 11 67 1,117 % (5) (45)%Income tax expense (benefit)(1,375) 867 245 (2,242) (259)% 622 254 %Operating income (1)4,888 4,050 2,479 838 21 % 1,571 63 %Depreciation and amortization5,984 6,243 4,688 (259) (4)% 1,555 33 %Cost of MetroPCS business combination (2)— 104 376 (104) (100)% (272) (72)%Stock-based compensation (3)307 235 222 72 31 % 13 6 %Other, net (4)34 7 42 27 386 % (35) (83)%Adjusted EBITDA (1)$11,213 $10,639 $7,807 $574 5 % $2,832 36 %Net income margin (Net income divided by service revenues)15% 5% 3% 1000 bps 200 bpsAdjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by service revenues) (1)37% 38% 31% -100 bps 700 bps(1)The amortized imputed discount on EIP receivables previously recognized as Interest income has been retrospectively re-classified as Other revenues.

The change in EIP receivables was primarily due to a decrease in net cash proceeds from the sale of EIP receivables as the year ended December 31, 2016 benefited from net cash proceeds of $361 million related to upsizing of the EIP securitization facility.Cash provided by operating activities increased $721 million, or 13%, in 2016 primarily from:•$727 million increase in Net income;•$1.4 billion increase in net non-cash income and expenses included in Net income primarily due to changes in Depreciation and amortization, Deferred income tax expense and Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses; partially offset by•$1.4 billion increase in net cash outflows from changes in working capital primarily due to changes in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.9 billion as well as the change in Equipment installment plan receivables, including inflows from the sale of certain EIP receivables, partially offset by the change in Inventories. Net cash used for Accounts payable and accrued liabilities was $1.2 billion in 2016 as compared to net cash provided by Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $693 million in 2015. Net cash proceeds from the sale of EIP and service receivables was $536 million in 2016 as compared to $884 million in 2015.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities increased $5.4 billion, or 95%, in 2017 primarily from:•A $3.0 billion decrease in Sales of short-term investments; •A $1.9 billion increase in Purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits, primarily driven by our winning bid for 1,525 licenses in the 600 MHz spectrum auction during the second quarter of 2017; and •A $535 million increase in Purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest primarily driven by growth in network build as we continued deployment of low band spectrum, including beginning deployment of 600 MHz.Cash used in investing activities decreased $3.9 billion, or 41%, in 2016, to a use of $5.7 billion primarily from:•$4.7 billion for Purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of $142 million primarily related to the build-out of our 4G LTE network;•$4.0 billion for Purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including a $2.2 billion deposit made to a third party in connection with a potential asset purchase; partially offset by•$3.0 billion in Sales of short-term investments.44Table of ContentsFinancing ActivitiesNet cash used in and provided by financing activities changed by $1.6 billion to a use of $1.2 billion, in 2017 primarily from: •$10.2 billion for Repayments of long-term debt;•$2.9 billion for Repayments of our revolving credit facility; •$486 million for Repayments of capital lease obligations;•$427 million for Repurchases of common shares; and•$300 million for Repayments of short-term debt for purchases of inventory, property and equipment, net; partially offset by •$10.5 billion in Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt; and •$2.9 billion in Proceeds from borrowing on our revolving credit facility.Cash provided by financing activities decreased $3.0 billion, or 86%, in 2016, to an inflow of $463 million primarily from:•$997 million in Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt; partially offset by•$205 million for Repayments of capital lease obligations; •$150 million for Repayments of short-term debt for purchases of inventory, property and equipment, net; and •$121 million for Tax withholdings on share-based awards. Cash and Cash EquivalentsAs of December 31, 2017, our Cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion.Free Cash FlowFree Cash Flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less payments for purchases of property and equipment. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management, investors and analysts of T-Mobile’s financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business.The following table illustrates the calculation of Free Cash Flow and reconciles Free Cash Flow to Net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure: Year Ended December 31, 2017 Versus 2016 2016 Versus 2015(in millions)2017 2016 2015 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeNet cash provided by operating activities$7,962 $6,135 $5,414 $1,827 30% $721 13 %Cash purchases of property and equipment(5,237) (4,702) (4,724) (535) 11% 22 — %Free Cash Flow$2,725 $1,433 $690 $1,292 90% $743 108 %Free Cash Flow increased $1.3 billion in 2017 primarily from:•Higher net cash provided by operating activities, as described above; partially offset by •Higher purchases of property and equipment primarily due to growth in network build as we deployed 700 MHz spectrum and began to deploy 600 MHz.

Cash purchases of property and equipment includes capitalized interest of $142 million and $246 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively.We adopted ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” on January 1, 2018. The standard will require a retrospective approach and impact the presentation of cash flows related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions, which is the deferred purchase price, resulting in a reclassification of cash 45Table of Contentsinflows from Operating activities to Investing activities of approximately $4.3 billion and $3.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The standard will also impact the presentation of cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, resulting in a reclassification of cash outflows from Operating activities to Financing activities of $188 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, in our consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of 2018, we plan to redefine Free Cash Flow to reflect the above changes in classification and present cash flows on a consistent basis for investor transparency.

See Note 5 - Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.On January 22, 2018, DT agreed to purchase $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.500% Senior Notes due 2026 and $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.750% Senior Notes due 2028 directly from T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, with no underwriting discount (the “DT Notes”). DT has agreed that the payment for the DT notes will be made by delivery of $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 8.097% Senior Reset Notes due 2021 and $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 8.195% Senior Reset Notes due 2022 (collectively, the “DT Senior Reset Notes”) held by DT and which T-Mobile USA will have called for redemption, in exchange for the DT notes. In connection with such exchange, we will pay DT in cash the premium portion of the redemption price set 48Table of Contentsforth in the indenture governing the DT Senior Reset Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest on the DT Senior Reset Notes to, but not including, the exchange date. The closing of the issuance and sale of the DT notes to DT, and exchange of the DT Senior Reset Notes, is expected to occur on or about April 30, 2018.Financing ArrangementsWe maintain a handset financing arrangement with Deutsche Bank AG (“Deutsche Bank”), which allows for up to $108 million in borrowings. Under the handset financing arrangement, we can effectively extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain handset vendors. The interest rate on the handset financing arrangement is determined based on LIBOR plus a specified margin per the arrangement. Obligations under the handset financing arrangement are included in Short-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2016, we utilized and repaid $100 million under the financing arrangement. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no outstanding balance.We maintain vendor financing arrangements with our primary network equipment suppliers. Under the respective agreements, we can obtain extended financing terms. The interest rate on the vendor financing arrangements is determined based on the difference between LIBOR and a specified margin per the agreements. Obligations under the vendor financing arrangements are included in Short-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2017, we utilized and repaid $300 million under the financing arrangement. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no outstanding balance.Revolving Credit FacilityWe had an unsecured revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom which allowed for up to $500 million in borrowings. In December 2016, we terminated our $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom.In December 2016, T-Mobile USA entered into a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom which comprised of (i) a three-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement and (ii) a three-year $1.5 billion secured revolving credit agreement. The applicable margin for the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility ranges from 2.00% to 3.25% per annum for Eurodollar Rate loans. The applicable margin for the Secured Revolving Credit Facility ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum for Eurodollar Rate loans. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. In January 2018, we utilized proceeds under the revolving credit facility to redeem $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% Senior Notes due 2022 and for general corporate purposes. As of February 5, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility. The Proceeds and borrowings from the revolving credit facility are presented in Proceeds from borrowing on revolving credit facility and Repayments of revolving credit facility within Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.See Note 7 - Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.We could seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2018, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other assets in private party transactions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. Excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions or other assets, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months. Our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of high yield callable debt and stock purchases.We determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.The indentures and credit facilities governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer and the Guarantor Subsidiaries (each as defined in Note 16 – Guarantor Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 49Table of Contents10-K) to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the Issuer to loan funds or make payments to the Parent. However, the Issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the Parent under the terms of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of December 31, 2017.Capital Lease FacilitiesWe have entered into uncommitted capital lease facilities with certain partners, which provide us with the ability to enter into capital leases for network equipment and services. As of December 31, 2017, we have committed to $2.1 billion of capital leases under these capital lease facilities, of which $887 million was executed during the year ended December 31, 2017.Capital ExpendituresOur liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure. Property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to our network transformation, including the build out of 700 MHz A-Block and 600 MHz spectrum licenses. We expect cash purchases of property and equipment, excluding capitalized interest, to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion in 2018. This includes expenditures for 5G deployment. Similar to 2017, cash capital expenditures will be front-end loaded in 2018 due to the build out of 600 MHz spectrum licenses. This does not include property and equipment obtained through capital lease agreements, leased wireless devices transferred from inventory or any additional purchases of spectrum licenses.In April 2017, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder of 1,525 licenses in the 600 MHz spectrum auction for an aggregate price of $8.0 billion. At the inception of the auction in June 2016, we deposited $2.2 billion with the FCC which, based on the outcome of the auction, was sufficient to cover our down payment obligation due in April 2017. In May 2017, we paid the FCC the remaining $5.8 billion of the purchase price using cash reserves and by issuing debt to DT, our majority stockholder, pursuant to existing debt purchase commitments. See Note 7 - Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.The $5.8 billion payment of the purchase price is included in Purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits within Net cash used in investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The licenses are included in Spectrum licenses as of December 31, 2017, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We began deployment of these licenses on our network in the third quarter of 2017. See Note 5 - Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.50Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of December 31, 2017 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods:(in millions)Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years More Than 5 Years TotalLong-term debt (1)$1,000 $— $8,000 $17,450 $26,450Interest on long-term debt1,501 2,939 2,539 1,976 8,955Capital lease obligations, including interest and maintenance682 972 218 172 2,044Tower obligations (2)189 379 381 1,006 1,955Operating leases (3)2,448 4,083 2,686 2,251 11,468Purchase obligations (4)2,146 2,216 1,492 960 6,814Network decommissioning (5)101 123 60 21 305Total contractual obligations$8,067 $10,712 $15,376 $23,836 $57,991(1)Represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment, capital lease obligations and vendor financing arrangements.

See Note 8 – Tower Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.(3)Future minimum lease payments for all cell site leases presented above to include payments due for the initial non-cancelable lease term only as they represent the payments which we cannot avoid at our option and also corresponds to our lease term assessment for new leases.(4)The minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contracts. Termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due as of the earliest we could exit the contract, typically in less than one year. For certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. This table does not include open purchase orders as of December 31, 2017 under normal business purposes. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.(5)Represents future undiscounted cash flows related to decommissioned MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant cell sites as of December 31, 2017.Certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. Other long-term liabilities, excluding network decommissioning, have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor of such payments. See Note 14 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.The purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase handsets and accessories, equipment, software, programming and network services, and marketing activities, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent T-Mobile’s entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which T-Mobile is contractually committed. Where T-Mobile is committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether it takes delivery, T-Mobile has included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. Additionally, included within purchase obligations are amounts for the acquisition of spectrum licenses, which are subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.In January 2018, we closed on a Unit Purchase Agreement to acquire the remaining equity in INS, a 54% owned unconsolidated subsidiary, for a purchase price of $25 million. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.In January 2018, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of Layer3 TV, Inc. (“Layer3 TV”) for consideration of approximately $325 million, subject to customary working capital and other post-closing adjustments. Upon closing of the transaction, Layer3 TV became a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In 2015, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain EIP accounts receivable on a revolving basis as an additional source of liquidity. In August 2017, the arrangement was amended to reduce the maximum funding commitment to $1.2 billion and extend the scheduled expiration date to November 2018. In December 2017, the arrangement was again 51Table of Contentsamended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $1.3 billion. See Note 3 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.In 2014, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as an additional source of liquidity. In November 2016, the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $950 million and extend the scheduled expiration date to March 2018. In February 2018, the arrangement was again amended to extend the scheduled expiration date to March 2019. As of December 31, 2017, T-Mobile derecognized net receivables of $2.7 billion upon sale through these arrangements. See Note 3 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Related-Party TransactionsDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into certain debt related transactions with affiliates. See Note 7 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.We also have related party transactions associated with DT or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany servicing and licensing.Disclosure of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2017, that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with DT. We have relied upon DT for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: Gostaresh Ertebatat Taliya, Irancell Telecommunications Services Company (“MTN Irancell”), Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran. For the year ended December 31, 2017, gross revenues of all DT affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic with Iran were less than $4 million and estimated net profits were less than $4 million.In addition, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, operating a fixed line network in their respective European home countries (in particular Germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the Embassy of Iran in those European countries. Gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 were less than $0.4 million. We understand that DT intends to continue these activities.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition as they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Six of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies.52Table of ContentsAllowancesWe maintain an allowance for credit losses, which is management’s estimate of such losses inherent in the receivables portfolio, comprised of accounts receivable and EIP receivable segments. Changes in the allowance for credit losses and, therefore, in related provision for credit losses (“bad debt expense”) can materially affect earnings. Credit risk characteristics are assessed for each receivable segment. In applying the judgment and review required to determine the allowance for credit losses, management considers a number of factors, including customer behavior, credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions. While our methodology attributes portions of the allowance to specific portfolio segments, the entire allowance for credit losses is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total receivables portfolio.Management also considers an amount that represents management’s judgment of risks inherent in the process and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses, including process risk and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments.To the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends or assumptions, the appropriate allowance levels for realized credit losses could differ from the estimate. We write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date.We offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments over a period of up to 24 months using a zero interest EIP. At the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest and record the EIP receivables at their present value, which is determined by discounting future payments at the imputed interest rate. The difference between the present value of the EIP receivables and their face amount results in a discount which is recorded as a direct reduction to the carrying value of the EIP receivable with a corresponding reduction to equipment revenue. The imputed discount rate is primarily comprised of current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk on the EIP receivables. As a result, we do not recognize a separate valuation allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included in the initial present value measurement of the EIP receivable. The imputed discount on EIP receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as Other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.Subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated credit losses on the gross EIP receivable segment exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances. Total imputed discount and allowances as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately 8.1% and 8.0%, respectively, of the total amount of gross accounts receivable, including EIP receivables.DepreciationDepreciation commences once assets have been placed in service. We generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit. Leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to T-Mobile, which is generally shorter than the lease term and considers expected losses. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. These studies consider actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate that an asset’s useful life is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book values are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4 – Property and Equipment of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management’s underlying estimates of useful lives.Evaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment We assess the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, for potential impairment annually as of December 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.When assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative 53Table of Contentsassessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. We recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. In the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. We believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value. We test spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with the management of the overall business at a national level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. If the carrying amount of spectrum licenses exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. We estimate the fair value of the spectrum licenses using the Greenfield approach, which is an income approach that estimates the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The Greenfield approach values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses). The value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. We base the assumptions underlying the Greenfield approach on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. Future cash flows in the Greenfield approach are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, EBITDA margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.The valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. If actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. The most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures and the long-term growth rate. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 – Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding our annual impairment test and impairment charges.Guarantee Liabilities We offer a device trade-in program, JUMP!, which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. Upon enrollment, participating customers must finance the purchase of a device on an EIP and have a qualifying T-Mobile monthly wireless service plan, which is treated as a single multiple-element arrangement when entered into at or near the same time. Upon qualifying JUMP! program upgrades, the customers’ remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade-in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new EIP.For customers who enroll in JUMP!, we establish a liability through the reduction of revenue, for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. The guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which requires judgment, including estimating the customer's remaining EIP balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used device at trade-in, and the probability and timing of trade-in. When customers upgrade their device, the difference between the EIP balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. All assumptions are reviewed periodically.Rent ExpenseMost of the leases on our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of rent payable over time. We calculate straight-line rent expense for each of these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such amount that a renewal appears, at lease inception or significant modification, to be reasonably assured. We consider several factors in assessing whether renewal periods are reasonably assured of being exercised, including the continued maturation of our network nationwide, technological advances within the telecommunications industry and the availability of alternative sites. We make 54Table of Contentssignificant assumptions at lease inception in determining and assessing the factors that constitute a “penalty.” In doing so, we primarily consider costs incurred in acquiring and developing new sites, the useful life of site improvements and equipment costs, future economic conditions and the extent to which improvements in wireless technologies can be incorporated into a current assessment of whether an economic compulsion will exist in the future to renew a lease.Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. A valuation allowance is maintained against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available. We consider many factors when determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedSee Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding recently issued accounting standards.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to economic risks in the normal course of business, primarily from changes in interest rates, including changes in investment yields and changes in spreads due to credit risk and other factors. These risks, along with other business risks, impact our cost of capital. Our policy is to manage exposure related to fluctuations in interest rates in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term. We have established interest rate risk limits that are closely monitored by measuring interest rate sensitivities of our debt portfolio. We do not foresee significant changes in the strategies used to manage market risk in the near future.We are exposed to changes in interest rates on our Incremental Term Loan Facility with DT, our majority stockholder. See Note 7 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.To perform the sensitivity analysis, we assessed the risk of a change in the fair value from the effect of a hypothetical interest rate change of positive 150 and negative 50 basis points. In cases where the debt is redeemable and the fair value calculation results in a liability greater than the cost to replace the debt, the maximum liability is assumed to be no greater than the current cost to redeem the debt. As of December 31, 2017, the change in the fair value of our Incremental Term Loan Facility, based on this hypothetical change, is shown in the table below: Carrying Amount Fair Value Fair Value Assuming(in millions)+150 Basis Point Shift -50 Basis Point ShiftLIBOR plus 2.00% Senior Secured Term Loan due 2022$2,000 $2,000 $1,914 $2,000LIBOR plus 2.00% Senior Secured Term Loan due 20242,000 2,020 1,868 2,02055Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:44:19.936612

Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return their device in good working condition or purchase their device. Customers that choose to purchase their device have the option to finance their device over a nine-month EIP.Network We continue to expand the footprint and increase the capacity of our network to better serve our customers. Our advancements in network technology and our spectrum resources ensure we can continue to increase the capabilities of our 4G LTE network as we prepare for our nationwide deployment of 5G.Spectrum GrowthWe provide wireless communication services utilizing mid-band spectrum licenses, such as Advanced Wireless Services (“AWS”) and Personal Communications Service (“PCS”), and low-band spectrum licenses utilizing our 600 MHz and 700 MHz spectrum.•We owned an average of 110 MHz of spectrum nationwide as of December 31, 2018, comprised of an average of 31 MHz in the 600 MHz band, 10 MHz in the 700 MHz band, 29 MHz in the 1900 MHz PCS band and 40 MHz in the AWS band. We also own millimeter wave spectrum that comprises an average of 264 MHz covering over 110 million points of presence (“POPs”) in the 28 GHz band and 105 MHz covering nearly 45 million POPs in the 39 GHz band. 6Table of ContentsWe will evaluate future spectrum purchases in current and upcoming auctions and in the secondary market to augment our current spectrum position.•As of December 31, 2018, we owned a nationwide average of 31 MHz of 600 MHz low-band spectrum. We now own approximately 41 MHz of low-band spectrum (600 MHz and 700 MHz), covering 100% of the U.S. •We are building out 5G across the US, including deployment in six of the top 10 markets, including New York and Los Angeles, in 2018. This network will be ready for the introduction of the first standards-based 5G smartphones in 2019. We plan on the delivery of a nationwide standards-based network next year. •In 2018, we entered into two multi-year contracts that will support the deployment of a nationwide 5G network. In July 2018, we and Nokia entered into a multi-year $3.5 billion contract for Nokia to provide us with complete end-to-end 5G technology, software and services. In September 2018, we and Ericsson announced a multi-year $3.5 billion contract in which Ericsson will provide us with the latest 5G New Radio hardware and software compliant with 3rd Generation Partnership Project (“3GPP”) standards.•We have started deployment of 600 MHz spectrum on an aggressive schedule. As of December 31, 2018, we were live in more than 2,700 cities and towns in 43 states and Puerto Rico covering hundreds of thousands of square miles. Combining 600 and 700 MHz spectrum, we have deployed low band spectrum to 301 million POPs.•We have actively engaged with broadcasters to accelerate the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) spectrum clearance timelines, entering into 95 agreements with several parties. These agreements are expected to, in aggregate, accelerate clearing, bringing the total clearing target to approximately 272 million POPs by year-end 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had cleared approximately 135 million POPs. We remain committed to assisting broadcasters occupying 600 MHz spectrum to move to new frequencies. •We currently have 29 devices compatible with 600 MHz including the latest iPhone generation.•We expect our 600 MHz spectrum holdings will be used to deploy America’s first nationwide standards-based 5G network next year. 600 MHz 4G LTE radios are software upgradeable to support 5G as it becomes available later this year.•Over the last year, we have entered into and closed on various agreements for the acquisition and exchange of 700 MHz A-Block, AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. See Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.•We intend to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future FCC spectrum license auctions.Network Coverage Growth•We continue to expand our coverage breadth and, as of December 31, 2018, covered more than 325 million people with 4G LTE.•As of December 31, 2018, we had equipment deployed on approximately 64,000 macro towers and 21,000 distributed antenna system (“DAS”) and small cell sites. We remain on plan to roll out approximately 20,000 small cells through 2019.Network Speed LeadershipWe offer the fastest nationwide 4G LTE upload and download speeds in the United States. The fourth quarter of 2018 is the 20th consecutive quarter we have led the industry in both categories based on the results of millions of user-generated speed tests.Network Capacity Growth We continue to expand our capacity through the re-farming of existing spectrum and implementation of new technologies including Voice over LTE (“VoLTE”), Carrier Aggregation, 4x4 multiple-input and multiple-output (“MIMO”), 256 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (“QAM”) and Licensed Assisted Access (“LAA”).•VoLTE comprised 87% of total voice calls as of December 31, 2018, compared to 80% as of December 31, 2017. Moving voice traffic to VoLTE frees up spectrum and allows for the transition of spectrum currently used for 2G and 3G to 4G LTE. We are leading the U.S. wireless industry in the rate of VoLTE adoption.•Carrier aggregation is live for our customers in 923 markets. This advanced technology delivers superior speed and 7Table of Contentsperformance by bonding multiple discrete spectrum channels together. •4x4 MIMO is currently available in 564 markets. This technology effectively delivers twice the speed and incremental network capacity to customers by doubling the number of data paths between the cell site and a customer's device. We started deploying massive MIMO (FD-capable and 5G with future software upgrades) in selected locations in late 2018.•We have rolled out 256 QAM in 988 markets. 256 QAM increases the number of bits delivered per transmission to enable faster speeds. We are the first carrier globally to have rolled out the combination of carrier aggregation, 4x4 MIMO and 256 QAM. This trifecta of standards has been rolled out to more than 500 markets.•We have also started rolling out LAA, a technology which utilizes unlicensed 5 GHz spectrum to augment available bandwidth. The first LAA small cell went live in New York City in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the technology has since been rolled out to nearly 1,700 cell sites, the vast majority being small cells. Deployments of LAA have also commenced in 28 cities including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Atlanta, Houston, Las Vegas, San Diego and New Orleans. In areas where LAA has been deployed, customers with capable handsets have observed real-life speeds in excess of 500 Mbps.•In July 2018, we launched our Narrowband Internet of Things (“NB-IoT”) service nationwide, making us the first to launch NB-IoT in the U.S. and the first in the world to launch NB-IoT in the guard bands for improved efficiency. Built on the 3GPP standard, NB-IoT is a low power, wide area network LTE-advanced technology that provides a pathway to 5G Internet of Things and enables many comparable benefits like low power usage, long battery life and low device cost.CompetitionThe wireless telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We are the third largest provider of postpaid service plans and the largest provider of prepaid service plans in the U.S. as measured by customers. Our competitors include other national carriers, such as AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”), Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”) and Sprint. AT&T and Verizon are significantly larger than us and enjoy greater resources and scale advantages as compared to us. In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller regional carriers, existing mobile virtual network operators (“MVNOs”), including TracFone Wireless, Inc., Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”) and Charter Communications, Inc., and future MVNOs, such as Altice USA, Inc., many of which offer or plan to offer no-contract, postpaid and prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice, messaging and data services, using alternative technologies or services. Competitive factors within the wireless telecommunications industry include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies, availability of additional spectrum licenses and regulatory changes. Some competitors have shown a willingness to use aggressive pricing as a source of differentiation. Other competitors have sought to add ancillary services, like mobile video, to enhance their offerings. Taken together, the competitive factors we face continue to put pressure on growth and margins as companies compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customers.EmployeesAs of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 52,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions.Regulation The FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The FCC has a number of complex requirements and proceedings that affect our operations and that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection, and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly. Wireless communications providers must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as 8Table of Contentsadopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10-15 years depending on the particular licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, Congress’ and the FCC’s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (“CMRS”), which includes cellular, PCS, miscellaneous wireless services and specialized mobile radio, could significantly increase competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers’ spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers. Congress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest albeit subject to review. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our Company by DT. This declaratory ruling, and our licenses, are conditioned on DT’s and the Company’s compliance with a network security agreement with the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security. Failure to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation of our spectrum licenses.While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communication providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of devices while driving, zoning and land use. Additionally, after the FCC’s adoption of the 2017 “Restoring Internet Freedom” Order, a number of states have sought to impose state-specific net neutrality and privacy requirements on providers’ broadband services. The FCC ruling broadly preempts such state efforts, which are inconsistent with the FCC’s federal deregulatory approach, and there are pending court challenges that will determine if such state enactments are lawful. While most states are largely seeking to codify the repealed federal rules, there are differences in some states, notably California, which has passed separate privacy and net neutrality legislation. There are efforts on the Hill to push for federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirements, while also ensuring the preemption of separate state requirements, including the California laws. If not rescinded, separate state requirements will impose significant business costs and could also result in increased litigation costs and enforcement risks. State authority over wireless broadband services will remain unsettled until final action by the courts or Congress. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other federal agencies have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are to some extent unknown and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.

Risk Factors In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our Company. Our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results, as well as the price of our common stock and other securities, could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.Risks Related to Our Business and the Wireless IndustryCompetition, industry consolidation, and changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We have multiple wireless competitors, some of which have greater resources than us and compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings; price; network coverage, speed and quality and customer service. We expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry’s customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rates, or possibly negative, leading to ongoing competition for customers. We also expect that our customers’ appetite for data services will place increasing demands on our network capacity. This competition and our capacity will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers. Our ability to compete will depend on, among other things, continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality and customer service, effective marketing and selling of products and services, innovation, attractive pricing, and cost management, all of which will involve significant expenses.Joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances in the wireless sector have resulted in and are expected to result in larger competitors competing for a limited number of customers. The two largest national wireless communication providers currently serve a significant percentage of all wireless customers and hold significant spectrum and other resources. Our largest competitors may be able to enter into exclusive handset, device, or content arrangements, execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaigns, or otherwise improve their cost position relative to ours. In addition, refusal of our large competitors to provide critical access to resources and inputs, such as roaming services on reasonable terms could improve their position within the wireless broadband mobile services industry.We face intense and increasing competition from other service providers as industry sectors converge, such as cable, telecom services and content, satellite, and other service providers. Companies like Comcast and AT&T (with acquisitions of DirecTV and Time Warner, Inc.) will have the scale and assets to aggressively compete in a converging industry. Verizon, through its acquisitions of AOL, Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. is also a significant competitor focusing on premium content offerings to diversify outside of core wireless. Further, some of our competitors now provide content services in addition to voice and broadband services, and consumers are increasingly accessing video content from Internet-based providers and applications, all of which create increased competition in this area. These factors, together with the effects of the increasing aggregate penetration of wireless services in all metropolitan areas and the ability of our larger competitors to use resources to build out their networks and to quickly deploy advanced technologies, such as 5G, could make it more difficult for us to continue to attract and retain customers, and may adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.The scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum, and regulations relating to spectrum use, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We will need to acquire additional spectrum in order to continue our customer growth, expand and deepen our coverage, maintain our quality of service, meet increasing customer demands and deploy new technologies. We will be at a competitive disadvantage and possibly experience erosion in the quality of service in certain markets if we fail to gain access to necessary spectrum before reaching network capacity. As a result, we are actively seeking to make additional investment in spectrum, which could be significant.The continued interest in, and acquisition of, spectrum by existing carriers and others may reduce our ability to acquire and/or increase the cost of acquiring spectrum in the secondary market or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other means, including government auctions. We may need to enter into spectrum sharing or leasing arrangements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and may involve significant expenditures. Gaining access to the spectrum we won in the FCC 600 MHz auction in 2017 may take up to three years or more. Any material delay could adversely impact our ability to implement our plans and efforts to improve our network. In addition, our return on investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customers and to provide additional services and usage to existing customers. As a result, the return on any investment in spectrum that we make may not be as much as we anticipate or take longer than 10Table of Contentsexpected. Additionally, we may be unable to secure the spectrum we need in any auction we may elect to participate in or in the secondary market, on favorable terms or at all.The FCC may impose conditions on the use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas. Additional conditions that may be imposed by the FCC include heightened build-out requirements, limited license terms or renewal rights, and clearing obligations that may make it less attractive or less economical to acquire spectrum. In addition, rules may be established for future government spectrum auctions that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas.If we cannot acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise, if competitors acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide services competitive with our services, or if we cannot deploy services over acquired spectrum on a timely basis without burdensome conditions, at reasonable cost, and while maintaining network quality levels, then our ability to attract and retain customers and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy.Significant technological changes continue to impact the communications industry. In general, these technological changes enhance communications and enable a broader array of companies to offer services competitive with ours. In order to grow and remain competitive with new and evolving technologies in our industry, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, continually invest in our network, increase network capacity, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings to address our current and potential customers’ changing demands. Enhancing our network, such as deploying 5G, is subject to risk from equipment changes and migration of customers from existing spectrum bands and the potential inability to secure spectrum necessary to deploy advanced technologies. Adopting new and sophisticated technologies may result in implementation issues such as scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints, regulatory permitting issues, customer dissatisfaction, and other issues that could cause delays in launching new technological capabilities, which in turn could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the upgrades. In general, the development of new services in the wireless telecommunications industry will require us to anticipate and respond to the continuously changing demands of our customers, which we may not be able to do accurately or timely. If our new services fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with these services are higher than anticipated, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches, whether directly or indirectly.Our business, like that of most retailers and wireless companies, involves the receipt, storage, and transmission of our customers’ confidential information, including sensitive personal information and payment card information, confidential information about our employees and suppliers, and other sensitive information about our Company, such as our business plans, transactions and intellectual property (“Confidential Information”). Unauthorized access to Confidential Information may be difficult to anticipate, detect, or prevent, particularly given that the methods of unauthorized access constantly change and evolve. We are subject to the threat of unauthorized access or disclosure of Confidential Information by state-sponsored parties, malicious actors, third parties or employees, errors or breaches by third-party suppliers, or other security incidents that could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of Confidential Information. In August 2018, we notified affected customers of an incident involving unauthorized access to certain customer contact information (not involving credit card information, financial data, social security numbers or passwords). While we do not believe the August 2018 security incident was material, we expect to continue to be the target of cyber-attacks, data breaches, or security incidents, which may in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.Cyber-attacks, such as denial of service and other malicious attacks, could disrupt our internal systems and applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers, and have other adverse effects on our business and that of others who depend on our services. As a telecommunications carrier, we are considered a critical infrastructure provider and therefore may be more likely to be the target of such attacks. Such attacks against companies may be perpetrated by a variety of groups or persons, including those in jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are ineffective or unavailable, and such attacks may even be perpetrated by or at the behest of foreign governments.In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third-party service providers as part of our business operations. These third-party service providers have experienced data breaches and other attacks that included unauthorized access to Confidential Information in the past, and face security challenges common to all parties that collect and process information. Past data breaches include a breach of the networks of one of our credit decisioning providers in 11Table of ContentsSeptember 2015, during which a subset of records containing current and potential customer information was acquired by an external party.Our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and to defend against attacks seeking to disrupt our services must be continually evaluated and revised to address the ever-evolving threat landscape. We cannot make assurances that all preventive actions taken will adequately repel a significant attack or prevent information security breaches or the misuses of data, unauthorized access by third parties or employees, or exploits against third-party supplier environments. If we or our third-party suppliers are subject to such attacks or security breaches, we may incur significant costs or other material financial impact, which may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, our cyber insurance, be subject to regulatory investigations, sanctions and private litigation, experience disruptions to our operations or suffer damage to our reputation. Any future cyber-attacks, data breaches, or security incidents may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.System failures and business disruptions may allow unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other systems which could materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.To be successful, we must provide our customers with reliable, trustworthy service and protect the communications, location, and personal information shared or generated by our customers. We rely upon both our systems and networks and the systems and networks of other providers and suppliers to provide and support our services and, in some cases, protect our customers’ information and our information. Failure of our or others’ systems, networks, or infrastructure may prevent us from providing reliable service or may allow for the unauthorized use of or interference with our networks and other systems or for the compromise of customer information. Examples of these risks include:•human error such as responding to deceptive communications or unintentionally executing malicious code;•physical damage, power surges or outages, or equipment failure, including those as a result of severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, political instability and volatility, and acts of war;•theft of customer and/or proprietary information offered for sale for competitive advantage or corporate extortion;•unauthorized access to our IT and business systems or to our network and critical infrastructure and those of our suppliers and other providers;•supplier failures or delays; and•system failures or outages of our business systems or communications network.Such events could cause us to lose customers, lose revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational damage, and subject us to litigation or governmental investigation. Remediation costs could include liability for information loss, repairing infrastructure and systems, and/or costs of incentives offered to customers. Our insurance may not cover, or be adequate to fully reimburse us for, costs and losses associated with such events.We are in the process of implementing a new billing system, which will support a portion of our subscribers, while maintaining our legacy billing system. Any unanticipated difficulties, disruption, or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial, and reputational effects on our business.We are currently implementing a new customer billing system, which involves a new third-party supported platform and utilization of a phased deployment approach. Post implementation, we plan to operate both the existing and new billing systems in parallel to aid in the transition to the new system until all phases of the conversion are complete.The implementation may cause major system or business disruptions, or we may fail to implement the new billing system in a timely or effective manner. In addition, the third-party billing services supporting vendor may experience errors, cyber-attacks, or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact us and over which we may have limited control. Interruptions and/or failure of this billing services system could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to provide or bill for our services, retain customers, attract new customers, or negatively impact overall customer experience. Any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and reputational damage.We rely on third parties to provide products and services for the operation of our business, and the failure or inability of such parties to provide these products or services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We depend heavily on suppliers, their subcontractors, and other third parties for us to efficiently operate our business. Due to the complexity of our business, it is not unusual to engage a diverse set of suppliers to help us develop, maintain, and 12Table of Contentstroubleshoot products and services such as network components, software development services, and billing and customer service support. Some of our suppliers may provide services from outside of the United States, which carries additional regulatory and legal obligations. We commonly rely on suppliers to provide us with contractual assurances and to disclose accurate information regarding risks associated with their provision of products or services in accordance with our policies and standards, including our Supplier Code of Conduct and our third party-risk management practices. The failure of our suppliers to comply with our expectations and standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Many of the products and services we use are available through multiple sources and suppliers. However, there are a limited number of suppliers who can support or provide billing services, voice and data communications transport services, network infrastructure, equipment, handsets, other devices, and payment processing services, among other products and services. Disruptions or failure of such suppliers to adequately perform could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In the past, our suppliers, contractors, service providers and third-party retailers may not have always performed at the levels we expected or at the levels required by their contracts. Our business could be severely disrupted if critical suppliers, contractors, service providers, or third-party retailers fail to comply with their contracts or become unable to continue providing goods or services. Our business could also be disrupted if we experience delays or service degradation during any transition to a new outsourcing provider or other supplier or if we are required to replace the supplied products or services with those from another source, especially if the replacement becomes necessary on short notice. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Economic, political, and market conditions may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results, as well as our access to financing on favorable terms or at all.Our business, financial condition, and operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, rates of inflation (or concerns about deflation), unemployment rates, economic growth, energy costs, and other macro-economic factors. Difficult, or worsening, general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Market volatility, political and economic uncertainty, and weak economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results in a number of ways. Our services and device financing plans are available to a broad customer base, a significant segment of which may be more vulnerable to weak economic conditions, particularly our subprime customers. We may have greater difficulty in gaining new customers within this segment, and existing customers may be more likely to terminate service and default on device financing plans due to an inability to pay.Weak economic conditions and credit conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers and dealers, some of which have filed for or may be considering bankruptcy, or may experience cash flow or liquidity problems, or are unable to obtain or refinance credit such that they may no longer be able to operate. Any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market, or sell our products and services.In addition, instability in the global financial markets could lead to periodic volatility in the credit, equity, and fixed income markets. This volatility could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financing arrangements include restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility.The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financing arrangements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions, and incurrence-based ratio tests, may limit our or our subsidiaries’ ability to pursue strategic business opportunities and engage in certain transactions, including the following:•incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock;•paying dividends, redeeming capital stock, or making other restricted payments or investments;•selling or buying assets, properties, or licenses;•developing assets, properties, or licenses that we have or in the future may procure;•creating liens on assets securing indebtedness or other obligations;13Table of Contents•participating in future FCC auctions of spectrum or private sales of spectrum; •engaging in mergers, acquisitions, business combinations, or other transactions;•entering into transactions with affiliates; and•placing restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments.These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain debt financing, engage in share repurchases, refinance or pay principal on our outstanding indebtedness, complete acquisitions for cash or indebtedness or react to business, economic, market and industry conditions and other changes in our operating environment or the economy. Any future indebtedness that we incur may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our debt agreements and other financing arrangements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these and other agreements, giving our lenders the right to terminate any commitments they had made to provide us with further funds and to require us to repay all amounts then outstanding. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Our ability to make payments on our debt, to repay our existing indebtedness when due, to fund our capital-intensive business and operations, and to make significant planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is in turn subject to the operational risks described elsewhere in this report. Our debt service obligations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and operating results, including by:•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the communications industry or pursuing growth opportunities;•reducing the amount of cash available for other operational or strategic needs; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors who are less leveraged than we are.Some of our debt has a variable rate of interest linked to various indices and only some of our exposure is hedged. If the changes in indices result in interest rate increases, our debt service requirements will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. In particular, some or all of our variable-rate indebtedness may use the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or similar rates as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequence of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness. In addition, any hedging agreements we have and may continue to enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations may not offer complete protection from these risks or may be unsuccessful, and consequently may effectively increase the interest rate we pay on our debt or the exchange rate with respect to such debt, and any portion not subject to such hedging agreements would have full exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations, as applicable. If any financial institutions that are parties to our hedging agreements were to default on their payment obligations to us, declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, we would be unhedged against the underlying exposures. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could result in a loss of investor confidence regarding our financial statements or may have a material adverse effect on our business.Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we along with our independently registered public accounting firm are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We rely heavily on IT systems as an important part of our internal controls in order to operate, transact, and otherwise manage our business, as well as provide effective and timely reporting of our financial results. Failure to design and maintain effective internal controls, including those over our IT systems, could constitute a material weakness that could result in inaccurate financial statements, inaccurate disclosures, or failure to prevent fraud. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm were unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence regarding our financial statements and our business could be materially adversely affected.14Table of ContentsOur financial condition and operating results will be impaired if we experience high fraud rates related to device financing, credit cards, dealers, or subscriptions.Our operating costs could increase substantially as a result of fraud, including device financing, customer credit card, subscription, or dealer fraud. If our fraud detection strategies and processes are not successful in detecting and controlling fraud, whether directly or by way of the systems, processes, and operations of third parties such as national retailers, dealers, and others, the resulting loss of revenue or increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.We rely on highly-skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture.The market for highly-skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly-skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, changes to U.S. immigration policy, competitors’ hiring practices, employee tolerance for the significant amount of change within and demands on our Company and our industry, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain and motivate our existing employees and to attract new employees. If we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employees and attracting new key personnel, we may not be able to meet our business plan and, as a result, our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected.Any acquisition, investment, or merger may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business.We may pursue acquisitions of, investments in or mergers with businesses, technologies, services and/or products that complement or expand our business. Some of these potential transactions could be significant relative to the size of our business and operations. Any such transaction would involve a number of risks and could present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:•diversion of management attention from running our existing business;•increased costs to integrate the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the business involved in any such transaction with our business;•difficulties in effectively integrating the financial and operational systems of the business involved in any such transaction into (or supplanting such systems with) our financial and operational reporting infrastructure and internal control framework in an effective and timely manner;•potential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process or as a result of any litigation arising in connection with any such transaction;•significant transaction expenses in connection with any such transaction, whether consummated or not;•risks related to our ability to obtain any required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate any such transaction;•acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and any such financing could significantly increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings; and•any business, technology, service, or product involved in any such transaction may significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from the transaction, which could, among other things, also result in a write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with such transaction.For any or all of these reasons, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment, or merger may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory MattersChanges in regulations or in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale, and interconnection of wireless communication systems, as do some state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and the resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. Additionally, the FTC and other federal and state agencies have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection, and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of wireless 15Table of Contentsproducts and services. We are subject to regulatory oversight by various federal, state and local agencies, as well as judicial review and actions, on issues related to the wireless industry that include, but are not limited to: roaming, interconnection, spectrum allocation and licensing, facilities siting, pole attachments, intercarrier compensation, Universal Service Fund (“USF”), net neutrality, 911 services, consumer protection, consumer privacy, and cybersecurity. We are also subject to regulations in connection with other aspects of our business, including handset financing and insurance activities.We cannot assure you that the FCC or any other federal, state or local agencies will not adopt regulations or take enforcement or other actions that would adversely affect our business, impose new costs, or require changes in current or planned operations. For example, under the Obama administration, the FCC established net neutrality and privacy regimes that applied to our operations. Both sets of rules potentially subjected some of our initiatives and practices to more burdensome requirements and heightened scrutiny by federal and state regulators, the public, edge providers, and private litigants regarding whether such initiatives or practices are compliant. While the FCC rules are now largely rolled back under the Trump administration, some state legislators and regulators are seeking to replace them with state laws, perpetuating uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment around these issues.In addition, states are increasingly focused on the quality of service and support that wireless communication providers provide to their customers and several states have proposed or enacted new and potentially burdensome regulations in this area. We also face potential investigations by, and inquiries from or actions by state public utility commissions. We also cannot assure you that Congress will not amend the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, and which serves to limit state authority, or enact other legislation in a manner that could be adverse to our business. Additionally, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) in June 2018, putting into place new data privacy rights for consumers, effective in January 2020. Legislators have stated that they intend to propose amendments to the CCPA before it goes into effect, and it remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. We will likely have to incur significant implementation costs to ensure compliance with the CCPA, and we could see increased litigation costs once the law goes into effect. If we are unable to put proper controls and procedures in place to ensure compliance, it could have an adverse effect on our business. Other states are considering similar legislation, which, if passed, could create more risks and potential costs for us.Failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We could be subject to fines, forfeitures, and other penalties (including, in extreme cases, revocation of our spectrum licenses) for failure to comply with FCC or other governmental regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.Unfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We are regularly involved in a number of legal proceedings before various state and federal courts, the FCC, the FTC, other federal agencies, and state and local regulatory agencies, including state attorneys general. Such legal proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energy of management and other key personnel. The assessment of the outcome of legal proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or pursuant to final judgment, order or decree may differ materially from amounts accrued in our financial statements. In addition, litigation or similar proceedings could impose restraints on our current or future manner of doing business. Such potential outcomes including judgments, awards, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We offer highly regulated financial services products. These products expose us to a wide variety of state and federal regulations.The financing of devices, through our EIP and JUMP! On Demand programs, has expanded our regulatory compliance obligations. Failure to remain compliant with applicable regulations, may increase our risk exposure in the following areas:•consumer complaints and potential examinations or enforcement actions by federal and state regulatory agencies, including but not limited to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, state attorneys general, the FCC and the FTC; and•regulatory fines, penalties, enforcement actions, civil litigation, and/or class action lawsuits.Failure to comply with applicable regulations and the realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.16Table of ContentsWe may not be able to adequately protect the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.We rely on a combination of patent, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which offer only limited protection. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary rights. We may not have the ability in certain jurisdictions to adequately protect intellectual property rights. Moreover, others may independently develop processes and technologies that are competitive to ours. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. We cannot be sure that any legal actions against such infringers will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. We cannot assure you that our pending or future patent applications will be granted or enforceable, or that the rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide us with any competitive advantages. In addition, we cannot assure you that any trademark or service mark registrations will be issued with respect to pending or future applications or will provide adequate protection of our brands. We do not have insurance coverage for intellectual property losses, and as such, a charge for an anticipated settlement or an adverse ruling awarding damages represents an unplanned loss event. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. We are a defendant in numerous intellectual property lawsuits, including patent infringement lawsuits, which exposes us to the risk of adverse financial impact either by way of significant settlement amounts or damage awards. As we adopt new technologies and new business systems and provide customers with new products and/or services, we may face additional infringement claims. These claims could require us to cease certain activities or to cease selling relevant products and services. These claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend, and divert management resources, and expose us to significant damages awards or settlements, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. In addition to litigation directly involving our Company, our vendors and suppliers can be threatened with patent litigation and/or subjected to the threat of disruption or blockage of sale, use, or importation of products, posing the risk of supply chain interruption to particular products and associated services which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Our business may be impacted by new or amended tax laws or regulations, judicial interpretations of same or administrative actions by federal, state, and/or local taxing authorities.In connection with the products and services we sell, we calculate, collect, and remit various federal, state, and local taxes, fees and regulatory charges (“tax” or “taxes”) to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including federal USF contributions and common carrier regulatory fees. In addition, we incur and pay state and local taxes and fees on purchases of goods and services used in our business.Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In many cases, the application of existing, newly enacted or amended tax laws (such as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) may be uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services, such as broadband internet access and cloud related services. Changes in tax laws could also impact revenue reported on tax inclusive plans.In the event that we have incorrectly described, disclosed, determined, calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts that were due to governmental authorities, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In the event that federal, state, and/or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes on our network, operations, or services, or seek to impose new taxes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Our wireless licenses are subject to renewal and may be revoked in the event that we violate applicable laws.Our existing wireless licenses are subject to renewal upon the expiration of the 10-year or 15-year period for which they are granted. Historically, the FCC has approved our license renewal applications. However, the Communications Act provides that licenses may be revoked for cause and license renewal applications denied if the FCC determines that a renewal would not serve the public interest. In addition, our licenses are subject to our compliance with the terms set forth in the agreement pertaining to national security among us, DT, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security. The failure of DT or the Company to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation or non-renewal of our spectrum licenses. If we fail to timely file to renew any wireless license or fail to meet any regulatory requirements for renewal, including construction and 17Table of Contentssubstantial service requirements, we could be denied a license renewal. Many of our wireless licenses are subject to interim or final construction requirements and there is no guarantee that the FCC will find our construction, or the construction of prior licensees, sufficient to meet the build-out or renewal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the FCC will renew our wireless licenses upon their expiration. If any of our wireless licenses were to be revoked or not renewed upon expiration, we would not be permitted to provide services under that license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Our business could be adversely affected by findings of product liability for health or safety risks from wireless devices and transmission equipment, as well as by changes to regulations or radio frequency emission standards.We do not manufacture the devices or other equipment that we sell, and we depend on our suppliers to provide defect-free and safe equipment. Suppliers are required by applicable law to manufacture their devices to meet certain governmentally imposed safety criteria. However, even if the devices we sell meet the regulatory safety criteria, we could be held liable with the equipment manufacturers and suppliers for any harm caused by products we sell if such products are later found to have design or manufacturing defects. We generally seek to enter into indemnification agreements with the manufacturers who supply us with devices to protect us from losses associated with product liability, but we cannot guarantee that we will be fully protected against all losses associated with a product that is found to be defective.Allegations have been made that the use of wireless handsets and wireless transmission equipment, such as cell towers, may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer and brain tumors. Lawsuits have been filed against manufacturers and carriers in the industry claiming damages for alleged health problems arising from the use of wireless handsets. In addition, the FCC has from time to time gathered data regarding wireless handset emissions and its assessment of this issue may evolve based on its findings. The media has also reported incidents of handset battery malfunction, including reports of batteries that have overheated. These allegations may lead to changes in regulatory standards. There have also been other allegations regarding wireless technology, including allegations that wireless handset emissions may interfere with various electronic medical devices (including hearing aids and pacemakers), airbags and anti-lock brakes. Defects in the products of our suppliers, such as the 2016 recall by a handset original equipment manufacturer on one of its smartphone devices, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Additionally, there are safety risks associated with the use of wireless devices while operating vehicles or equipment. Concerns over any of these risks and the effect of any legislation, rules or regulations that have been and may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to sell our wireless services.Risks Related to Ownership of our Common StockWe are controlled by DT, whose interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders.DT beneficially owns and possesses majority voting power of the fully diluted shares of our common stock. Through its control of the voting power of our common stock and the rights granted to DT in our certificate of incorporation and the Stockholder’s Agreement, DT controls the election of our directors and all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. By virtue of DT’s voting control, we are a “controlled company,” as defined in The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) listing rules, and are not subject to NASDAQ requirements that would otherwise require us to have a majority of independent directors, a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors. Accordingly, our stockholders will not be afforded the same protections generally as stockholders of other NASDAQ-listed companies with respect to corporate governance for so long as we rely on these exemptions from the corporate governance requirements.In addition, our certificate of incorporation and the Stockholder’s Agreement restrict us from taking certain actions without DT’s prior written consent as long as DT beneficially owns 30% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including:•the incurrence of debt (excluding certain permitted debt) if our consolidated ratio of debt to cash flow, as defined in the indenture dated April 28, 2013, for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available would exceed 5.25 to 1.0 on a pro forma basis;•the acquisition of any business, debt or equity interests, operations or assets of any person for consideration in excess of $1.0 billion;•the sale of any of our or our subsidiaries’ divisions, businesses, operations or equity interests for consideration in excess of $1.0 billion;•the incurrence of secured debt (excluding certain permitted secured debt);18Table of Contents•any change in the size of our Board of Directors;•the issuances of equity securities in excess of 10% of our outstanding shares or to repurchase debt held by DT;•the repurchase or redemption of equity securities or the declaration of extraordinary or in-kind dividends or distributions other than on a pro rata basis; and•the termination or hiring of our chief executive officer.These restrictions could prevent us from taking actions that our Board of Directors may otherwise determine are in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders or that may be in the best interests of our other stockholders.DT effectively has control over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, changes to our certificate of incorporation, a sale or merger of our Company and other transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law. DT’s controlling interest may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, the Company. DT may have strategic, financial, or other interests different from our other stockholders, including as the holder of a substantial amount of our indebtedness and as the counter-party in a number of commercial arrangements, and may make decisions adverse to the interests of our other stockholders.In addition, we license certain trademarks from DT, including the right to use the trademark “T-Mobile” as a name for the Company and our flagship brand, under a trademark license agreement with DT. As described in more detail in our proxy statement under the heading “Transactions with Related Persons and Approval”, we are obligated under the trademark license agreement to pay DT a royalty in an amount equal to 0.25%, which we refer to as the royalty rate, of the net revenue (as defined in the trademark license) generated by products and services we sell under the licensed trademarks. The trademark license agreement includes a royalty rate adjustment mechanism that would have occurred in early 2018 and potentially resulted in a new royalty rate effective in January 2019. The license agreement includes a royalty rate adjustment mechanism that has been postponed until the conclusion of the proposed Sprint Merger. The current royalty rate will remain effective until that time. The royalty rate under the license agreement will be adjusted retroactively if the Business Combination Agreement is terminated. We also have the right to terminate the trademark license upon one year’s prior notice. An increase in the royalty rate or termination of the trademark license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Future sales or issuances of our common stock, including sales by DT, could have a negative impact on our stock price.We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares or the availability of shares of our common stock will have on the prevailing trading price of our common stock from time to time. Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline and could result in dilution of your shares.We and DT are parties to the Stockholder’s Agreement pursuant to which DT is free to transfer its shares in public sales without notice, as long as such transactions would not result in the transferee owning 30% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If a transfer would exceed the 30% threshold, it is prohibited unless the transferee makes a binding offer to purchase all of the other outstanding shares on the same price and terms. The Stockholder’s Agreement does not otherwise impose any other restrictions on the sales of common stock by DT. Moreover, we have filed a shelf registration statement with respect to the common stock and certain debt securities held by DT, which would facilitate the resale by DT of all or any portion of the shares of our common stock it holds. The sale of shares of our common stock by DT (other than in transactions involving the purchase of all of our outstanding shares) could significantly increase the number of shares available in the market, which could cause a decrease in our stock price. In addition, even if DT does not sell a large number of its shares into the market, its right to transfer a large number of shares into the market may depress our stock price.Our stock price may be volatile and may fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results.The trading prices of the securities of communications companies historically have been highly volatile, and the trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations. Our stock price may fluctuate in reaction to a number of events and factors that may include, among other things:•our or our competitors’ actual or anticipated operating and financial results; •introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors or changes in service plans or pricing by us or our competitors;•analyst projections, predictions and forecasts, analyst target prices for our securities and changes in, or our failure to meet, securities analysts’ expectations;19Table of Contents•transaction in our common stock by major investors;•share repurchases by us or purchases by DT;•DT’s financial performance, results of operation, or actions implied or taken by DT;•entry of new competitors into our markets or perceptions of increased price competition, including a price war;•our performance, including subscriber growth, and our financial and operational metric performance;•market perceptions relating to our services, network, handsets, and deployment of our LTE platform and our access to iconic handsets, services, applications, or content;•market perceptions of the wireless communications industry and valuation models for us and the industry;•conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry sectors in which we operate;•changes in our credit rating or future prospects;•changes in interest rates;•changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;•the availability or perceived availability of additional capital in general and our access to such capital;•actual or anticipated consolidation, or other strategic mergers or acquisition activities involving us or our competitors, or other participants in related or adjacent industries, or market speculations regarding such activities, including the pending Merger and views of market participants regarding the likelihood the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied and the anticipated benefits of the Merger will be realized;•disruptions of our operations or service providers or other vendors necessary to our network operations; •the general state of the U.S. and world politics and economies; and•availability of additional spectrum, whether by the announcement, commencement, bidding and closing of auctions for new spectrum or the acquisition of companies that own spectrum, and the extent to which we or our competitors succeed in acquiring additional spectrum.In addition, the stock market has been volatile in the recent past and has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which may continue for the foreseeable future. This volatility has had a significant impact on the trading price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in the communications industry. These changes frequently occur irrespective of the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the trading price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results.We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our credit facilities and the indentures and supplemental indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to use future earnings, if any, to invest in our business and to fund our previously authorized stock repurchase program if the Merger fails to close.Our previously announced stock repurchase program, and any subsequent stock purchase program put in place from time to time, could affect the price of our common stock, increase the volatility of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves. Such repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.We may have in place from time to time, a stock repurchase program. Any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under any such stock repurchase program depends on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows, the price of our common stock, corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions. We may effect repurchases under any stock repurchase program from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including accelerated stock repurchase arrangements. Repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness. Additionally, our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. See Note 12 – Repurchases of Common Stock of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Form 10-K for further information.20Table of ContentsRisks Related to the Proposed TransactionsThe closing of the Transactions is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of approvals from various governmental entities, which may not approve the Transactions, may delay the approvals for, or may impose conditions or restrictions on, jeopardize or delay completion of, or reduce or delay the anticipated benefits of, the Transactions, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Transactions will not be completed.The completion of the Transactions is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, obtaining certain governmental authorizations, consents, orders or other approvals, including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, the receipt of required approvals from the FCC and any state and territorial public utility commissions or similar state and foreign regulatory bodies, and the absence of any injunction prohibiting the Transactions or any legal requirements enacted by a court or other governmental entity preventing the completion of the Transactions. There is no assurance that these required authorizations, consents, orders or other approvals will be obtained or that they will be obtained in a timely manner, or whether they will be subject to required actions, conditions, limitations or restrictions on the combined company’s business, operations or assets. If any such required actions, conditions, limitations or restrictions are imposed, they may jeopardize or delay completion of the Transactions, reduce or delay the anticipated benefits of the Transactions or allow the parties to the Business Combination Agreement to terminate the Business Combination Agreement, which could result in a material adverse effect on our or the combined company’s business, financial condition or operating results. In addition, the completion of the Transactions is also subject to T-Mobile USA having specified minimum credit ratings on the closing date of the Transactions (after giving effect to the Merger) from at least two of three specified credit rating agencies, subject to certain qualifications. In the event that we terminate the Business Combination Agreement in connection with a failure to satisfy the closing condition related to the specified minimum credit ratings, then in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay Sprint an amount equal to $600 million. If the Transactions are not completed by April 29, 2019 (subject to extension to July 29, 2019, and further extension to October 29, 2019, if the only conditions not satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, which conditions are then capable of being satisfied) are conditions relating to the required regulatory and other governmental consents and the absence of restraints), either we or Sprint may terminate the Business Combination Agreement. The Business Combination Agreement may also be terminated if the other conditions to closing are not satisfied, and we and Sprint may also mutually decide to terminate the Business Combination Agreement.Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact us and our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition or results of operations.If the Merger is not completed for any reason, we may be subject to a number of material risks. The price of our common stock may decline to the extent that its current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. In addition, some costs related to the Transactions must be paid by us whether or not the Transactions are completed. Furthermore, we may experience negative reactions from our stockholders, customers, employees, suppliers, distributors, retailers, dealers and others who deal with us, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, it is expected that if the Merger is not completed, we will continue to lack the network, scale and financial resources of the current market share leaders in, and other companies that have more recently begun providing, wireless services. Further, if the Merger is not completed, it is expected that we will not be able to deploy a nationwide 5G network on the same scale and on the same timeline as the combined company, and therefore will continue to be limited in their respective abilities to compete effectively in the 5G era.We are subject to various uncertainties, including litigation and contractual restrictions and requirements while the Transactions are pending that could disrupt our or the combined company’s business and adversely affect our or the combined company’s business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition and results of operations.Uncertainty about the effect of the Transactions on employees, customers, suppliers, vendors, distributors, dealers and retailers may have an adverse effect on us or the combined company. These uncertainties may impair the ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel during the pendency of the Transactions and, if the Transactions are completed, for a period of time thereafter, as existing and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If key employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, the combined company’s business following the completion of the Transactions could be negatively impacted. We or the combined company may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent. Additionally, these uncertainties could cause customers, suppliers, distributors, dealers, retailers and others to seek to change or cancel existing business relationships 21Table of Contentswith us or the combined company or fail to renew existing relationships. Suppliers, distributors and content and application providers may also delay or cease developing for us or the combined company new products that are necessary for the operations of its business due to the uncertainty created by the Transactions. Competitors may also target our existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties that may result from the Transactions.The Business Combination Agreement also restricts us, without Sprint’s consent, from taking certain actions outside of the ordinary course of business while the Transactions are pending, including, among other things, certain acquisitions or dispositions of businesses and assets, entering into or amending certain contracts, repurchasing or issuing securities, making capital expenditures and incurring indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions. These restrictions may have a significant negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Management and financial resources have been diverted and will continue to be diverted toward the completion of the Transactions. We have incurred, and expect to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Transactions. These costs could adversely affect our or the combined company’s financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we and our affiliates are involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, investigations and proceedings and litigation matters that arise from time to time, and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect us and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the combined company.The Business Combination Agreement contains provisions that restrict the ability of our Board to pursue alternatives to the Transactions.The Business Combination Agreement contains non-solicitation provisions that restrict our ability to solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the completion of which would constitute an alternative transaction for purposes of the Business Combination Agreement. In addition, the Business Combination Agreement does not permit us to terminate the Business Combination Agreement in order to enter into an agreement providing for, or to complete, such an alternative transaction.Our directors and officers may have interests in the Transactions different from the interests of our stockholders.Certain of our directors and executive officers negotiated the terms of the Business Combination Agreement. Our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Transactions that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders. These interests include, but are not limited to, the continued service of certain of our directors as directors of the combined company, the continued employment of certain of our executive officers by the combined company, severance agreements and amended employment terms and other rights held by our directors and executive officers, and provisions in the Business Combination Agreement regarding continued indemnification of and advancement of expenses to our directors and officers.Risks Related to Integration and the Combined CompanyAlthough we expect that the Transactions will result in synergies and other benefits, those synergies and benefits may not be realized or may not be realized within the expected time frame.Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions will depend, to a large extent, on the combined company’s ability to integrate our and Sprint’s businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the projected standalone cost savings and revenue growth trends identified by each company without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. In addition, some of the anticipated synergies are not expected to occur for a significant time period following the completion of the Transactions and will require substantial capital expenditures in the near term to be fully realized. Even if the combined company is able to integrate the two companies successfully, the anticipated benefits of the Transactions, including the expected synergies and network benefits, may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.Our business and Sprint’s business may not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected. Operating costs, customer loss and business disruption, including difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, suppliers or vendors, may be greater than expected following the Transactions. Revenues following the Transactions may be lower than expected.The combination of two independent businesses is complex, costly and time-consuming and may divert significant management attention and resources to combining our and Sprint’s business practices and operations. This process may disrupt 22Table of Contentsour business. The failure to meet the challenges involved in combining the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined company and could adversely affect the results of operations of the combined company. The overall combination of our and Sprint’s businesses may also result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, and loss of customer and other business relationships. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:•the diversion of management attention to integration matters;•difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including intellectual property and communications systems, administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems;•challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the two companies;•differences in control environments, cultures, and auditor expectations may result in future weaknesses and deficiencies while we work to integrate the companies and align guidelines and practices;•alignment of key performance measurements may result in a greater need to communicate and manage clear expectations while we work to integrate the companies and align guidelines and practices;•difficulties in integrating employees and attracting and retaining key personnel;•challenges in retaining existing customers and obtaining new customers;•difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, accretion targets, business opportunities, financing plans and growth prospects from the combination;•difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;•the impact of the additional debt financing expected to be incurred in connection with the Transactions;•the transition of management to the combined company management team, and the need to address possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;•contingent liabilities that are larger than expected; and•potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the Transactions.Some of these factors are outside of our control and/or will be outside the control of the combined company, and any one of them could result in lower revenues, higher costs and diversion of management time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. In addition, even if the operations of our and Sprint’s businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including, among others, the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our and Sprint’s businesses. All of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings per share of the combined company, decrease or delay the projected accretive effect of the Merger, and negatively impact the price of our common stock following the Merger. As a result, it cannot be assured that the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint will result in the realization of the full benefits expected from the Transactions within the anticipated time frames or at all.The indebtedness of the combined company following the completion of the Transactions will be substantially greater than the indebtedness of each of T-Mobile and Sprint on a standalone basis prior to the execution of the Business Combination Agreement. This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect the combined company’s business flexibility and increase its borrowing costs.In connection with the Transactions, we and Sprint have conducted, and expect to conduct, certain pre-Merger financing transactions, which will be used in part to prepay a portion of our and Sprint’s existing indebtedness and to fund liquidity needs. After giving effect to the pre-Merger financing transactions and the Transactions, we anticipate that the combined company will have consolidated indebtedness of up to approximately $75.0 billion to $77.0 billion, based on estimated December 31, 2018 debt and cash balances and excluding tower obligations.Our substantially increased indebtedness following the Transactions will have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business, economic, market and industry conditions and increasing the amount of cash required to meet interest payments. In addition, this increased level of indebtedness following the Transactions may reduce funds available to support efforts to combine our and Sprint’s businesses and realize the expected benefits of the Transactions, and may also reduce funds available for capital expenditures, share repurchases and other activities that may put the combined company at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Further, it may be necessary for the combined company to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in its debt instruments, which could increase the risks associated with the capital structure of the combined company.23Table of ContentsBecause of the substantial indebtedness of the combined company following the completion of the Transactions, there is a risk that the combined company may not be able to service its debt obligations in accordance with their terms.The ability of the combined company to service its substantial debt obligations following the Transactions will depend in part on future performance, which will be affected by business, economic, market and industry conditions and other factors, including the ability of the combined company to achieve the expected benefits of the Transactions. There is no guarantee that the combined company will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt obligations when due. If the combined company is unable to meet such obligations or fails to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing such debt obligations, it may be required to refinance all or part of its debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices or make additional borrowings. The combined company may not be able to, at any given time, refinance its debt, sell assets or make additional borrowings on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations after the Transactions.Some or all of the combined company’s variable-rate indebtedness may use the LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequence of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness. In addition, any hedging agreements we have and may continue to enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations may not offer complete protection from these risks or may be unsuccessful, and consequently may effectively increase the interest rate we pay on our debt or the exchange rate with respect to such debt, and any portion not subject to such hedging agreements would have full exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations, as applicable. If any financial institutions that are parties to our hedging agreements were to default on their payment obligations to us, declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, we would be unhedged against the underlying exposures. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.The agreements governing the combined company’s indebtedness and other financings will include restrictive covenants that limit the combined company’s operating flexibility.The agreements governing the combined company’s indebtedness and other financings will impose material operating and financial restrictions on the combined company. These restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions and maintenance and incurrence-based financial tests, may limit the combined company’s ability to engage in transactions and pursue strategic business opportunities, including the following:•incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock;•paying dividends, redeeming capital stock or making other restricted payments or investments;•selling or buying assets, properties or licenses;•developing assets, properties or licenses which the combined company has or in the future may procure;•creating liens on assets securing indebtedness or other obligations;•participating in future FCC auctions of spectrum or private sales of spectrum;•engaging in mergers, acquisitions, business combinations or other transactions;•entering into transactions with affiliates; and•placing restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments.These restrictions could limit the combined company’s ability to obtain debt financing, make share repurchases, refinance or pay principal on its outstanding indebtedness, complete acquisitions for cash or indebtedness or react to business, economic, market and industry conditions and other changes in its operating environment or the economy. Any future indebtedness that the combined company incurs may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the combined company’s debt agreements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these and other agreements, giving the combined company’s lenders the right to terminate any commitments they had made to provide it with further funds and to require the combined company to repay all amounts then outstanding.The financing of the Transactions is not assured.Although we have received debt financing commitments from lenders to provide various financing arrangements to facilitate the Transactions, the obligation of the lenders to provide these facilities is subject to a number of conditions and the financing of the Transactions may not be obtained on the expected terms or at all.24Table of ContentsIn particular, we have received commitments for $30.0 billion in debt financing to fund the Transactions which is comprised of (i) a $4.0 billion secured revolving credit facility, (ii) a $7.0 billion term loan credit facility and (iii) a $19.0 billion secured bridge loan facility. Our reliance on the financing from the $19.0 billion secured bridge loan facility commitment is intended to be reduced through one or more secured note offerings or other long-term financings prior to the merger closing. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to issue any such secured notes or other long-term financings on terms we find acceptable or at all, especially in light of the recent debt market volatility, in which case we may have to exercise some or all of the commitments under the secured bridge facility to fund the Transactions. Accordingly, the costs of financing for the Transactions may be higher than expected.Credit rating downgrades could adversely affect the businesses, cash flows, financial condition and operating results of T-Mobile and, following the Transactions, the combined company.Credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings, and, as a result, cost of capital. Our current ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or, following the completion of the Transactions, obligations to the combined company’s obligors. Each rating agency reviews these ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that such ratings will be maintained in the future. A downgrade in the rating of us and/or Sprint could adversely affect the businesses, cash flows, financial condition and operating results of T-Mobile and, following the Transactions, the combined company.We have incurred, and will incur, direct and indirect costs as a result of the Transactions.We have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of completing the Transactions, and over a period of time following the completion of the Transactions, the combined company also expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with integrating and coordinating our and Sprint’s businesses, operations, policies and procedures. A portion of the transaction costs related to the Transactions will be incurred regardless of whether the Transactions are completed. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses will exceed the costs historically borne by us. These costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations prior to the Transactions and the financial condition and results of operations of the combined company following the Transactions.Item 1B.

Comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the standards in effect for those periods. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.(2)In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) was signed into legislation. The TCJA included numerous changes to existing tax law, including a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The rate reduction took place on January 1, 2018. We recognized a net tax benefit of $2.2 billion associated with the enactment of the TCJA in Income tax (expense) benefit in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. (3)On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” (the “new cash flow standard”) which impacted the presentation of our cash flows related to our beneficial interests in securitization transactions, which is the deferred purchase price, resulting in a reclassification of cash inflows from Operating activities to Investing activities of approximately $5.4 billion, $4.3 billion, $3.4 billion, $3.5 billion and $2.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The new cash flow standard also impacted the presentation of our cash payments for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs, resulting in a reclassification of cash outflows from Operating activities to Financing activities of $212 million, $188 million and $39 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2014, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. There were no cash payments for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. We have applied the new cash flow standard retrospectively to all periods presented. (4)We believe current and future regulatory changes have made the Lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical. We will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the Lifeline program, but have excluded the Lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 4,528,000 reported wholesale customers in 2017.28Table of ContentsItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewThe objectives of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) are to provide users of our Consolidated Financial Statements with the following:•A narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results;•Context to the financial statements; and•Information that allows assessment of the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.Our MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the three years ended December 31, 2018, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our MD&A are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.Business OverviewUn-carrier StrategyWe are the Un-carrier. Through our Un-carrier strategy, we’ve disrupted the wireless communication services industry by listening to our customers and providing them with added value and an exceptional experience, including implementing signature initiatives that changed the wireless industry forever. These Un-carrier initiatives include the following launched during 2018:•In August 2018, we introduced Un-carrier Next, a new initiative that radically changes the structure of our customer service department and solves several significant pain points for customers. Postpaid customers will get directly through to a human when they call customer support, and that human will be one member of a “Team of Experts” devoted to that customer and other customers in their geographic region. No bots, no bouncing, no BS.•Un-carrier Next also provided customers exclusive access to a free one-year Pandora Plus subscription via the T-Mobile Tuesdays App in August 2018. In addition, we announced an exclusive multi-year partnership with Live Nation, the world’s largest live entertainment company, giving Un-carrier customers rock star status at Live Nation amphitheater and arena concerts, including access to last-minute reserve seats in sold-out sections and discounted tickets.In September 2018, in connection with the rebranding of our prepaid brand, MetroPCS, as Metro by T-Mobile, we introduced new unlimited rate plans with tiers that feature added benefits of Google One and Amazon Prime as well as an expanded selection of the latest and greatest smartphones. Gone are the outdated perceptions that prepaid service is synonymous with limited coverage, cheap flip phones or bad credit.Our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues and we believe our Un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved branded postpaid phone and branded prepaid customer churn.

The combined company will be named “T-Mobile” and, as a result of the Merger, is expected to be able to rapidly launch a nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation and increase competition in the U.S. wireless, video and broadband industries. Immediately following the Merger, it is anticipated that DT and SoftBank Group Corp. will hold, directly or indirectly, on a fully diluted basis, approximately 41.7% and 27.4%, respectively, of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock, with the remaining approximately 30.9% of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock held by other stockholders, based on closing share prices and certain other assumptions as of December 31, 2018. The Merger is subject to regulatory approvals and certain other customary closing conditions. We expect to receive regulatory approval in the first half of 2019.For more information regarding our Business Combination Agreement, see Note 2 – Business Combinations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Acquisitions•On January 1, 2018, we closed on our previously announced Unit Purchase Agreement to acquire the remaining equity in Iowa Wireless Services, LLC (“IWS”), a 54% owned unconsolidated subsidiary, for a purchase price of $25 million. We accounted for our acquisition of IWS as a business combination and recognized a bargain purchase gain of approximately $25 million as part of our purchase price allocation and a gain on our previously held equity interest of approximately $15 million in Other income, net in 2018.•On January 22, 2018, we completed our acquisition of television innovator Layer3 TV for cash consideration of $318 million. Upon closing of the transaction, Layer3 TV became a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary. Layer3 TV acquires and distributes digital entertainment programming primarily through the internet to residential customers, offering direct to home digital television and multi-channel video programming distribution services. This transaction represented an opportunity to acquire a complementary service to our existing wireless service to advance our video strategy. We accounted for the purchase of Layer3 TV as a business combination and recognized $218 million of goodwill as part of our purchase price allocation.For more information regarding our acquisitions, see Note 2 – Business Combinations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Current YearRevenue RecognitionOn January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue standard. See Note 10 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the new revenue standard and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards.30Table of ContentsThe impact of our adoption of the new revenue standard is presented in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in the following table which presents a comparison of selected financial information under both the new revenue standard and the previous revenue standard for the year ended December 31, 2018: Year Ended December 31, 2018 Previous Revenue Standard New Revenue Standard ChangeGAAP financial measures Branded postpaid service revenues (in millions)$20,887 $20,862 $(25)Branded prepaid service revenues (in millions)9,608 9,598 (10)Net income (in millions)2,593 2,888 295Performance measures Branded postpaid phone ARPU$46.45 $46.40 $(0.05)Branded postpaid ABPU58.49 58.44 (0.05)Branded prepaid ARPU38.56 38.53 (0.03)Non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDA (in millions)$12,000 $12,398 $398Statement of Cash FlowsOn January 1, 2018, we adopted the new cash flow standard which impacted the presentation of our cash flows related to our beneficial interests in securitization transactions, which is the deferred purchase price, resulting in a reclassification of cash inflows from Operating activities to Investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The new cash flow standard also impacted the presentation of our cash payments for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs, resulting in a reclassification of cash outflows from Operating activities to Financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We have applied the new cash flow standard retrospectively to all periods presented. For additional information regarding the new cash flow standard and the impact of our adoption, see “Selected Financial Data” and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Financial InstrumentsIn January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments (Topic 825): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The standard became effective for us, and we adopted the standard, on January 1, 2018. The standard requires the impact of adoption to be recorded to retained earnings under a modified retrospective approach. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.Income TaxesIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, “Accounting for Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.” The standard requires that the income tax impact of intra-entity sales and transfers of property, except for inventory, be recognized when the transfer occurs. The standard became effective for us, and we adopted the standard, on January 1, 2018. The standard requires any deferred taxes not yet recognized on intra-entity transfers to be recorded to retained earnings under a modified retrospective approach. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.Derivatives and HedgingIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvement to Accounting for Hedging Activities.” The standard modified the guidance for the designation and measurement of qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. We adopted this standard on October 1, 2018, and have applied the standard to hedging transactions prospectively.31Table of ContentsHurricane ImpactsDuring 2018, we recognized $61 million in costs related to hurricanes, including $36 million in incremental costs to maintain services primarily in Puerto Rico related to hurricanes that occurred in 2017 and $25 million related to hurricanes that occurred in 2018. Additional costs related to a hurricane that occurred in 2018 are expected to be immaterial in the first quarter of 2019.During 2018, we received reimbursement payments from our insurance carriers of $307 million related to hurricanes, of which $93 million was previously accrued for as a receivable as of December 31, 2017. We have accrued insurance recoveries related to a hurricane that occurred in 2018 of approximately $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as an offset to the costs incurred within Cost of services in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and as an increase to Other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.The following table shows the impacts of hurricanes to our results, operating metrics and non-GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. There were no significant hurricane impacts in 2016.

See Note 17 – Guarantor Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.39Table of ContentsPerformance MeasuresIn managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures. These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry on key operating and financial measures.Total CustomersA customer is generally defined as a SIM number with a unique T-Mobile identifier which is associated with an account that generates revenue. Branded customers generally include customers that are qualified either for postpaid service utilizing phones, DIGITS or connected devices which includes tablets, wearables and SyncUp DRIVE, where they generally pay after receiving service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance. Wholesale customers include M2M and MVNO customers that operate on our network but are managed by wholesale partners.The following table sets forth the number of ending customers: December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 2018 Versus 2017 2017 Versus 2016(in thousands) # Change % Change # Change % ChangeCustomers, end of period Branded postpaid phone customers (1)(2)37,224 34,114 31,297 3,110 9% 2,817 9 %Branded postpaid other customers (2)5,295 3,933 3,130 1,362 35% 803 26 %Total branded postpaid customers42,519 38,047 34,427 4,472 12% 3,620 11 %Branded prepaid customers (1)21,137 20,668 19,813 469 2% 855 4 %Total branded customers63,656 58,715 54,240 4,941 8% 4,475 8 %Wholesale customers (3)15,995 13,870 17,215 2,125 15% (3,345) (19)%Total customers, end of period79,651 72,585 71,455 7,066 10% 1,130 2 %Adjustments to branded postpaid phone customers (4)— — (1,365) — —% 1,365 (100)%Adjustments to branded prepaid customers (4)— — (326) — —% 326 (100)%Adjustments to wholesale customers (4)— — 1,691 — —% (1,691) (100)%(1)As a result of the acquisition of IWS, we included an adjustment of 13,000 branded postpaid phone and 4,000 branded prepaid IWS customers in our reported subscriber base as of January 1, 2018. Additionally, as a result of the acquisition of Layer3 TV, we included an adjustment of 5,000 branded prepaid customers in our reported subscriber base as of January 22, 2018. (2)During 2017, we retitled our “Branded postpaid mobile broadband customers” category to “Branded postpaid other customers” and reclassified 253,000 DIGITS customers from our “Branded postpaid phone customers” category for the second quarter of 2017, when the DIGITS product was released.(3)We believe current and future regulatory changes have made the Lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical. We will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the Lifeline program, but have excluded the Lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 4,528,000 reported wholesale customers in 2017.(4)As a result of the MVNO transaction, we included an adjustment of 1,365,000 branded postpaid phone customers and 326,000 branded prepaid customers to wholesale customers on September 1, 2016. Prospectively from September 1, 2016, net customer additions for these customers are included within wholesale customers.Branded Customers Total branded customers increased 4,941,000, or 8%, in 2018 primarily from:•Higher branded postpaid phone customers driven by the growing success of new customer segments and rate plans such as T-Mobile ONE Unlimited 55+, T-Mobile ONE Military, T-Mobile for Business and T-Mobile Essentials and continued growth in existing and Greenfield markets, along with lower churn, partially offset by competitive activity;•Higher branded postpaid other customers primarily due to higher gross customer additions from wearables; and•Higher branded prepaid customers driven by the continued success of our Metro by T-Mobile brand due to promotional activities and rate plan offers. 40Table of ContentsWholesaleWholesale customers increased 2,125,000, or 15%, in 2018 primarily due to the continued success of our M2M and MVNO partnerships. Net Customer AdditionsThe following table sets forth the number of net customer additions: Year Ended December 31, 2018 Versus 2017 2017 Versus 2016(in thousands)2018 2017 2016 # Change% Change # Change % ChangeNet customer additions Branded postpaid phone customers (1) (2)3,097 2,817 3,307 280 10 % (490) (15)%Branded postpaid other customers (2)1,362 803 790 559 70 % 13 2 %Total branded postpaid customers4,459 3,620 4,097 839 23 % (477) (12)%Branded prepaid customers (1)460 855 2,508 (395) (46)% (1,653) (66)%Total branded customers4,919 4,475 6,605 444 10 % (2,130) (32)%Wholesale customers (3)2,125 1,183 1,568 942 80 % (385) (25)%Total net customer additions7,044 5,658 8,173 1,386 24 % (2,515) (31)%(1)As a result of the acquisition of IWS and Layer3 TV, customer activity post acquisition was included in our net customer additions beginning in the first quarter of 2018. (2)During 2017, we retitled our “Branded postpaid mobile broadband customers” category to “Branded postpaid other customers” and included DIGITS customers and reclassified 253,000 DIGITS customer net additions from our “Branded postpaid phone customers” category for the second quarter of 2017, when the DIGITS product was released.(3)Net customer activity for Lifeline was excluded beginning in the second quarter of 2017, due to our determination based upon changes in the applicable government regulations that the Lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners is uneconomical.Branded CustomersTotal branded net customer additions increased 444,000, or 10%, in 2018 primarily from:•Higher branded postpaid other net customer additions primarily due to higher gross customer additions from wearables and lower churn, partially offset by lower gross customer additions from other connected devices; and•Higher branded postpaid phone net customer additions primarily due to lower churn and continued growth in existing and Greenfield markets including the growing success of new customer segments and rate plans such as T-Mobile ONE Unlimited 55+, T-Mobile ONE Military, T-Mobile for Business and T-Mobile Essentials, partially offset by the impact from more aggressive service promotions and the launch of Un-carrier Next - All Unlimited with taxes and fees in the first quarter of 2017. These increases were partially offset by•Lower branded prepaid net customer additions primarily due to increased competitive activity, partially offset by lower migrations to branded postpaid plans.WholesaleWholesale net customer additions increased 942,000, or 80%, in 2018 primarily due to lower deactivations driven by the removal of Lifeline program customers. Customers Per AccountCustomers per account is calculated by dividing the number of branded postpaid customers as of the end of the period by the number of branded postpaid accounts as of the end of the period. An account may include branded postpaid phone customers and branded postpaid other customers which includes DIGITS and connected devices such as tablets, wearables and SyncUp DRIVE. We believe branded postpaid customers per account provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate our branded postpaid customer base on a per account basis.41Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth the branded postpaid customers per account: December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 2018 Versus 2017 2017 Versus 2016 # Change % Change # Change % ChangeBranded postpaid customers per account3.03 2.93 2.86 0.10 3% 0.07 2%Branded postpaid customers per account increased 3% in 2018 primarily from continued growth of new customer segments and rate plans such as T-Mobile ONE Unlimited 55+, T-Mobile ONE Military, T-Mobile for Business and T-Mobile Essentials, promotional activities targeting families and the success of connected devices.ChurnChurn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period. The number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored within a certain period of time. We believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.The following table sets forth the churn: Year Ended December 31, Bps Change 2018 Versus 2017 Bps Change 2017 Versus 20162018 2017 2016 Branded postpaid phone churn1.01% 1.18% 1.30% -17 bps -12 bpsBranded prepaid churn3.96% 4.04% 3.88% -8 bps 16 bpsBranded postpaid phone churn decreased 17 basis points in 2018, primarily from increased customer satisfaction and loyalty from ongoing improvements to network quality, industry-leading customer service and the overall value of our offerings. Branded prepaid churn decreased 8 basis points in 2018, primarily due to the continued impact from the optimization of our third-party distribution channels which was substantially completed during the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher deactivations from a growing customer base and increased competitive activity.Average Revenue Per User, Average Billings Per UserAverage Revenue Per User (“ARPU”) represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue realization per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. Branded postpaid phone ARPU excludes Branded postpaid other customers and related revenues which includes DIGITS and connected devices such as tablets, wearables and SyncUp DRIVE.Average Billings Per User (“ABPU”) represents the average monthly customer billings, including monthly lease revenues and EIP billings before securitization, per customer. We believe Branded Postpaid ABPU was an important metric during the transition from classic plans to EIP based plans as it helped explain the customer billing relationship in a period which had shifts in customer billings from branded postpaid service revenues to equipment sales revenues. We believe the usefulness of ABPU to management, investors and analysts has decreased in recent periods as the remaining classic plan base is immaterial and Branded postpaid service revenue and Branded postpaid phone ARPU metrics in periods presented are now comparable. We therefore plan to discontinue reporting ABPU beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2019.42Table of ContentsThe following tables illustrate the calculation of our operating measures ARPU and ABPU and reconcile these measures to the related service revenues:(in millions, except average number of customers, ARPU and ABPU)Year Ended December 31, 2018 Versus 2017 2017 Versus 20162018 2017 2016$ Change % Change$ Change % ChangeCalculation of Branded Postpaid Phone ARPU Branded postpaid service revenues$20,862 $19,448 $18,138 $1,414 7 % $1,310 7 %Less: Branded postpaid other revenues(1,117) (1,077) (773) (40) 4 % (304) 39 %Branded postpaid phone service revenues$19,745 $18,371 $17,365 $1,374 7 % $1,006 6 %Divided by: Average number of branded postpaid phone customers (in thousands) and number of months in period35,458 32,596 30,484 2,862 9 % 2,112 7 %Branded postpaid phone ARPU$46.40 $46.97 $47.47 $(0.57) (1)% $(0.50) (1)%Calculation of Branded Postpaid ABPU Branded postpaid service revenues$20,862 $19,448 $18,138 $1,414 7 % $1,310 7 %EIP billings6,548 5,866 5,432 682 12 % 434 8 %Lease revenues692 877 1,416 (185) (21)% (539) (38)%Total billings for branded postpaid customers$28,102 $26,191 $24,986 $1,911 7 % $1,205 5 %Divided by: Average number of branded postpaid customers (in thousands) and number of months in period40,075 36,079 33,184 3,996 11 % 2,895 9 %Branded postpaid ABPU$58.44 $60.49 $62.75 $(2.05) (3)% $(2.26) (4)%Calculation of Branded Prepaid ARPU Branded prepaid service revenues$9,598 $9,380 $8,553 $218 2 % $827 10 %Divided by: Average number of branded prepaid customers (in thousands) and number of months in period20,761 20,204 18,797 557 3 % 1,407 7 %Branded prepaid ARPU$38.53 $38.69 $37.92 $(0.16) — % $0.77 2 %Branded Postpaid Phone ARPUBranded postpaid phone ARPU decreased $0.57, or 1%, in 2018 primarily due to:•The growing success of new customer segments and rate plans such as T-Mobile ONE Unlimited 55+, T-Mobile ONE Military, T-Mobile for Business and T-Mobile Essentials; •The ongoing growth in our Netflix offering, which totaled $0.35 for 2018 and decreased branded postpaid phone ARPU by $0.32 compared to full-year 2017; •A reduction in certain non-recurring charges; •The negative impact of the new revenue standard of $0.05; partially offset by •A net reduction in promotional activities.We continue to expect that Branded postpaid phone ARPU in full-year 2019 will be generally stable compared to full-year 2018.Branded Postpaid ABPUBranded postpaid ABPU decreased $2.05, or 3%, in 2018 primarily from:•Lower branded postpaid phone ARPU;•Lower lease revenues; and•Growth in the branded postpaid other customer base with a lower ARPU than branded postpaid phone.43Table of ContentsBranded Prepaid ARPUBranded prepaid ARPU decreased $0.16 in 2018 primarily from dilution from promotional rate plans, partially offset by the continued growth of Metro by T-Mobile customers.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA represents earnings before Interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, non-cash Stock-based compensation and certain income and expenses not reflective of our operating performance. Net income margin represents Net income divided by Service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues.Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, network decommissioning costs and costs related to the Transactions, as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, as well as certain other nonrecurring income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).The following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure: Year Ended December 31, 2018 Versus 2017 2017 Versus 2016(in millions)2018 2017 2016$ Change % Change$ Change % ChangeNet income$2,888 $4,536 $1,460 $(1,648) (36)% $3,076 211 %Adjustments: Interest expense835 1,111 1,418 (276) (25)% (307) (22)%Interest expense to affiliates522 560 312 (38) (7)% 248 79 %Interest income(19) (17) (13) (2) 12 % (4) 31 %Other (income) expense, net54 73 6 (19) (26)% 67 1,117 %Income tax expense (benefit)1,029 (1,375) 867 2,404 (175)% (2,242) (259)%Operating income5,309 4,888 4,050 421 9 % 838 21 %Depreciation and amortization6,486 5,984 6,243 502 8 % (259) (4)%Cost of MetroPCS business combination— — 104 — NM (104) (100)%Stock-based compensation (1)389 307 235 82 27 % 72 31 %Cost associated with the Transactions196 — — 196 NM — NMOther, net (2)18 34 7 (16) (47)% 27 386 %Adjusted EBITDA$12,398 $11,213 $10,639 $1,185 11 % $574 5 %Net income margin (Net income divided by service revenues)9% 15% 5% -600 bps 1000 bpsAdjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by service revenues)39% 37% 38% 200 bps -100 bps(1)Stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree to stock-based compensation expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2)Other, net may not agree to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income primarily due to certain non-routine operating activities, such as other special items that would not be expected to reoccur or are not reflective of T-Mobile’s ongoing operating performance, and are therefore excluded in Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.2 billion, or 11%, in 2018 primarily from:•Higher service revenues, as further discussed above; 44Table of Contents•The positive impact from the new revenue standard of $398 million; •Higher other revenues, as further discussed above;•Lower losses on equipment;•The positive impact of the reimbursements from our insurance carriers, net of costs incurred related to hurricanes, for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $158 million, compared to costs incurred related to hurricanes, net of insurance recoveries, of $201 million in the year ended December 31, 2017; partially offset by•Higher selling, general and administrative expenses;•Lower gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $235 million; and•Higher cost of services.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and common stock, capital leases, the sale of certain receivables, financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms and secured and unsecured revolving credit facilities with DT. Upon consummation of the Transactions, we will incur substantial third-party indebtedness which will increase our future financial commitments, including aggregate interest payments on higher total indebtedness, and may adversely impact our liquidity. Further, the incurrence of additional indebtedness may inhibit our ability to incur new debt under the terms governing our existing and future indebtedness, which may make it more difficult for us to incur new debt in the future to finance our business strategy.Cash FlowsOn January 1, 2018, we adopted the new cash flow standard which impacted the presentation of our cash flows related to our beneficial interests in securitization transactions, which is the deferred purchase price, resulting in a reclassification of cash inflows from Operating activities to Investing activities of approximately $5.4 billion, $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The new cash flow standard also impacted the presentation of our cash payments for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs, resulting in a reclassification of cash outflows from Operating activities to Financing activities of $212 million and $188 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. There were no cash payments for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs during the year ended December 31, 2016. We have applied the new cash flow standard retrospectively to all periods presented.For additional information regarding the new cash flow standard and the impact of our adoption, see “Selected Financial Data” and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The following is a condensed schedule of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016: Year Ended December 31, 2018 Versus 2017 2017 Versus 2016(in millions)2018 2017 2016 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeNet cash provided by operating activities$3,899 $3,831 $2,779 $68 2 % $1,052 38 %Net cash used in investing activities(579) (6,745) (2,324) 6,166 (91)% (4,421) 190 %Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities(3,336) (1,367) 463 (1,969) 144 % (1,830) (395)%Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities increased $68 million, or 2%, primarily from higher net non-cash adjustments to Net income, partially offset by lower Net income and higher net cash outflows from working capital changes.•The change in Net income and the net non-cash adjustments to Net income were primarily from the impacts of the TCJA in 2017 and the absence of Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses in 2018.•The higher net use in working capital was primarily from a paydown of Accounts payable and changes in Accounts receivable, partially offset by changes in Inventories and EIP receivables.45Table of ContentsInvesting ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities decreased $6.2 billion, or 91%, to a use of $579 million for 2018.The use of cash for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily from:•$5.5 billion in Purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, primarily driven by growth in network build as we continued deployment of low band spectrum, including the continued deployment of 600 MHz, and started laying the groundwork for 5G; and •$338 million of cash consideration paid, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of Layer3 TV and IWS; partially offset by •$5.4 billion in Proceeds related to beneficial interest in securitization transactions.Financing ActivitiesNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities increased $2.0 billion, or 144%, to a use of $3.3 billion for 2018.The use of cash for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily from:•$6.3 billion for Repayments of our revolving credit facility;•$3.3 billion for Repayments of long-term debt;•$1.1 billion for Repurchases of common stock; and•$700 million for Repayments of capital lease obligations; partially offset by•$6.3 billion in Proceeds from borrowing on our revolving credit facility; and•$2.5 billion in Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt.Cash and Cash EquivalentsAs of December 31, 2018, our Cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion.Free Cash FlowFree Cash Flow represents Net cash provided by operating activities less payments for Purchases of property and equipment, including Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions and less Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management, investors and analysts of our financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business.In the first quarter of 2018, we redefined our non-GAAP financial measure Free Cash Flow to reflect the adoption of the new cash flow standard to present cash flows on a consistent basis for investor transparency. We have applied the change in definition retrospectively in the table below, which illustrates the calculation of Free Cash Flow and reconciles Free Cash Flow to Net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure: Year Ended December 31, 2018 Versus 2017 2017 Versus 2016(in millions)2018 2017 2016 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeNet cash provided by operating activities$3,899 $3,831 $2,779 $68 2% $1,052 38%Cash purchases of property and equipment(5,541) (5,237) (4,702) (304) 6% (535) 11%Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions5,406 4,319 3,356 1,08725% 963 29%Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs(212) (188) — (24)13% (188) NMFree Cash Flow$3,552 $2,725 $1,433 $827 30% $1,292 90%46Table of ContentsFree Cash Flow increased $827 million, or 30%, for 2018 from:•Higher proceeds related to our deferred purchase price from securitization transactions and net cash provided by operating activities; partially offset by•Higher Purchases of property and equipment, net of capitalized interest of $362 million and $136 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in cash purchases of property and equipment was primarily due to growth in network build as we continued deployment of low band spectrum, including the continued deployment of 600 MHz, and started laying the groundwork for 5G.Borrowing Capacity and Debt FinancingAs of December 31, 2018, our total debt was $27.5 billion, excluding our tower obligations, of which $26.7 billion was classified as long-term debt. See Note 8 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of our debt to third parties and debt to affiliates.In December 2016, T-Mobile USA entered into a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with DT which is comprised of (i) a three-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement and (ii) a three-year $1.5 billion secured revolving credit agreement. In January 2018, we utilized proceeds under the revolving credit facility to redeem $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% Senior Notes due 2022 and for general corporate purposes. On January 29, 2018, the proceeds utilized under our revolving credit facility with DT were repaid. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. In November 2018, we amended the terms of the revolving credit facility with DT to extend the maturity date to December 29, 2021.We maintain a handset financing arrangement with Deutsche Bank AG (“Deutsche Bank”), which allows for up to $108 million in borrowings. Under the handset financing arrangement, we can effectively extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain handset vendors. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was no outstanding balance.We maintain vendor financing arrangements with our primary network equipment suppliers. Under the respective agreements, we can obtain extended financing terms. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was no outstanding balance.Consents on Debt to Third PartiesOn May 18, 2018, under the terms and conditions described in the Consent Solicitation Statement, we obtained consents necessary to effect certain amendments to our Senior Notes to third parties in connection with the Business Combination Agreement. Pursuant to the Consent Solicitation Statement, third-party note holders agreed, among other things, to consent to increasing the amount of Secured Indebtedness under Credit Facilities that can be incurred from the greater of $9 billion and 150% of Consolidated Cash Flow to the greater of $9 billion and an amount that would not cause the Secured Debt to Cash Flow Ratio (calculated net of cash and cash equivalents) to exceed 2.00x (the “Ratio Secured Debt Proposed Amendments”) and in each case as such capitalized term is defined in the Indenture. In connection with receiving the requisite consents for the Ratio Secured Debt Proposed Amendments, we made upfront payments to third-party note holders of $17 million during the second quarter of 2018. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These upfront payments increased the effective interest rate of the related debt.In addition, note holders agreed, among other things, to allow certain entities related to Sprint’s existing spectrum securitization notes program (“Existing Sprint Spectrum Program”) to be non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, provided that the principal amount of the spectrum notes issued and outstanding under the Existing Sprint Spectrum Program does not exceed $7.0 billion and that the principal amount of such spectrum notes reduces the amount available under the Credit Facilities ratio basket, and to revise the definition of GAAP to mean generally accepted accounting principles in effect from time to time, unless the Company elects to “freeze” GAAP as of any date, and to exclude the effect of the changes in the accounting treatment of lease obligations (the “Existing Sprint Spectrum and GAAP Proposed Amendments,” and together with the Ratio Secured Debt Proposed Amendments, the “Proposed Amendments”). In connection with receiving the requisite consents for the Existing Sprint Spectrum and GAAP Proposed Amendments, we made upfront payments to third-party note holders of $14 million during the second quarter of 2018. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These upfront payments increased the effective interest rate of the related debt.In connection with obtaining the requisite consents, on May 20, 2018, T-Mobile USA, the guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, executed and delivered the 37th supplemental indenture to the Indenture, pursuant to which, with respect to each of the Notes, the Proposed Amendments will become effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger.47Table of ContentsWe paid third-party bank fees associated with obtaining the requisite consents related to the Proposed Amendments of $6 million during the second quarter of 2018, which we recognized as Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. If the Merger is consummated, we will make additional payments to third-party note holders for requisite consents related to the Ratio Secured Debt Proposed Amendments of up to $54 million and additional payments to third-party note holders for requisite consents related to the Existing Sprint Spectrum and GAAP Proposed Amendments of up to $41 million. We have not accrued these payments as of December 31, 2018. See Note 8 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Future Sources and Uses of LiquidityWe may seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2019, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other assets in private party transactions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. Excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions, or for other assets, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months as well as our longer-term liquidity needs. Our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of high yield callable debt and stock purchases.We determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.The indentures and credit facilities governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the Issuer to loan funds or make payments to the Parent. However, the Issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the Parent under the terms of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of December 31, 2018.Capital Lease FacilitiesWe have entered into uncommitted capital lease facilities with certain partners, which provide us with the ability to enter into capital leases for network equipment and services. As of December 31, 2018, we have committed to $3.0 billion of capital leases under these capital lease facilities, of which $885 million was executed during the year ended December 31, 2018. Capital ExpendituresOur liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure. Property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to our network transformation, including the build-out of 600 MHz low-band spectrum licenses. We expect cash purchases of property and equipment, excluding capitalized interest of approximately $400 million, to be $5.4 to $5.7 billion and cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, to be to be $5.8 to $6.1 billion in 2019. This includes expenditures for 600 MHz and 5G deployment. This does not include property and equipment obtained through capital lease agreements, leased wireless devices transferred from inventory or any additional purchases of spectrum licenses.Share RepurchasesOn December 6, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of our common stock through December 31, 2018 (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”). Repurchased shares are retired. The 2017 Stock Repurchase Program completed on April 29, 2018.48Table of ContentsOn April 27, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the total stock repurchase program to $9.0 billion, consisting of the $1.5 billion in repurchases previously completed and up to an additional $7.5 billion of repurchases of our common stock. The additional $7.5 billion repurchase authorization is contingent upon the termination of the Business Combination Agreement and the abandonment of the Transactions contemplated under the Business Combination Agreement. See Note 12 – Repurchases of Common Stock of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.DividendsWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our credit facilities and the indentures and supplemental indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of December 31, 2018 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods:(in millions)Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years More Than 5 Years TotalLong-term debt (1)$— $2,000 $5,400 $18,200 $25,600Interest on long-term debt1,366 2,679 2,273 1,950 8,268Capital lease obligations, including interest and maintenance909 1,020 168 106 2,203Tower obligations (2)195 391 392 835 1,813Operating leases (3)2,698 4,684 3,290 3,762 14,434Purchase obligations (4)3,377 2,800 1,786 1,367 9,330Network decommissioning (5)79 79 39 5 202Total contractual obligations$8,624 $13,653 $13,348 $26,225 $61,850(1)Represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment, capital lease obligations and vendor financing arrangements.

See Note 9 – Tower Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.(3)Future minimum lease payments for all cell site leases presented above to include payments due for the initial non-cancelable lease term only as they represent the payments which we cannot avoid at our option and also corresponds to our lease term assessment for new leases.(4)The minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contracts. Termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due as of the earliest we could exit the contract, typically in less than one year. For certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. This table does not include open purchase orders as of December 31, 2018 under normal business purposes. See Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.(5)Represents future undiscounted cash flows related to decommissioned MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant cell sites as of December 31, 2018.Certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. Other long-term liabilities, excluding network decommissioning, have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor of such payments. See Note 16 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.The purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase handsets and accessories, equipment, software, programming and network services and marketing activities, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we are contractually committed. Where we are committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether we take delivery, we have included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. Additionally, included within purchase obligations are amounts for the acquisition of spectrum licenses, which are subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.49Table of ContentsIn October 2018, we entered into, and designated, interest rate lock derivatives as cash flow hedges to reduce variability in cash flows due to changes in interest payments attributable to increases or decreases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. The fair value of interest rate lock derivatives as of December 31, 2018 was $447 million and is included in Other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Balances related to the cash flow hedges have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of settlements. See Note 7 – Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have arrangements, as amended from time to time, to sell certain EIP accounts receivable and service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as a source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2018, we derecognized net receivables of $2.6 billion upon sale through these arrangements. See Note 4 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Related Party TransactionsDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into certain debt-related transactions with affiliates. See Note 8 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.In the first quarter of 2018, DT, our majority stockholder and an affiliated purchaser, purchased 3.3 million additional shares of our common stock at an aggregate market value of $200 million in the public market or from other parties, in accordance with the rules of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements. There were no purchases in the remainder of 2018. We did not receive proceeds from these purchases. See Note 12 – Repurchases of Common Stock of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.We also have related party transactions associated with DT or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany servicing and licensing.Disclosure of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2018, that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with DT. We have relied upon DT for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: Gostaresh Ertebatat Taliya, Irancell Telecommunications Services Company, Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran. In addition, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, provided basic telecommunications services in 2018 to Telecommunication Company of Iran and to three customers in Germany identified on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List maintained by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control: Bank Melli, Bank Sepah, and Europäisch-Iranische Handelsbank. These services have been terminated or are in the process of being terminated. For the year ended December 31, 2018, gross revenues of all DT affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic and telecommunications services with the Iranian parties identified herein were less than $1 million, and the estimated net profits were less than $1 million.In addition, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, operating a fixed-line network in their respective European home countries (in particular Germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the Embassy of Iran in those European countries. Gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were less than $0.1 million. We understand that DT intends to continue these activities.50Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition as they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Seven of these policies, below, are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or inputs. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies.Revenue RecognitionWe primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless services to customers and selling or leasing devices and accessories. Our contracts with customers may involve multiple performance obligations, which include wireless services, wireless devices or a combination thereof, and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.Significant JudgmentsThe most significant judgments affecting the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with our customers include the following items:•Revenue for service contracts that we assess are not probable of collection is not recognized until the contract is completed and cash is received. Collectibility is re-assessed when there is a significant change in facts or circumstances. Our assessment of collectibility considers whether we may limit our exposure to credit risk through our right to stop transferring additional service in the event the customer is delinquent as well as certain contract terms such as down payments that reduce our exposure to credit risk. Customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain. See “Allowances,” below, for more discussion on how we assess credit risk.•Promotional EIP bill credits offered to a customer on an equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining a service contract may result in an extended service contract based on whether a substantive penalty is deemed to exist. Determining whether contingent EIP bill credits result in a substantive termination penalty may require significant judgment.•The identification of distinct performance obligations within our service plans may require significant judgment.•Revenue is recorded net of costs paid to another party for performance obligations where we arrange for the other party to transfer goods or services to the customer (i.e., when we are acting as an agent). For example, performance obligations relating to services provided by third-party content providers where we neither controls a right to the content provider’s service nor controls the underlying service itself are presented net because we are acting as an agent. The determination of whether we control the underlying service or right to the service prior to our transfer to the customer requires, at times, significant judgment.•For transactions where we recognize a significant financing component, judgment is required to determine the discount rate. For EIP sales, the discount rate used to adjust the transaction price primarily reflects current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk of the customer. Customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain. See “Allowances”, below, for more discussion on how we assess credit risk.•Our products are generally sold with a right of return, which is accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Device return levels are estimated based on the expected value method as there are a large number of contracts with similar characteristics and the outcome of each contract is independent of the others. Historical return rate experience is a significant input to our expected value methodology.•Sales of equipment to indirect dealers who have been identified as our customer (referred to as the sell-in model) often include credits subsequently paid to the dealer as a reimbursement for any discount promotions offered to the end consumer. These credits (payments to a customer) are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize from the sales of equipment to indirect dealers and are estimated based on historical experience and other factors, such as expected promotional activity. •The determination of the standalone selling price for contracts that involve more than one performance obligation may require significant judgment, such as when the selling price of a good or service is not readily observable.•For capitalized contract costs, determining the amortization period over which such costs are recognized as well as assessing the indicators of impairment may require significant judgment. 51Table of ContentsAllowancesWe maintain an allowance for credit losses, which is management’s estimate of such losses inherent in our receivables portfolio, comprised of accounts receivable and EIP receivable segments. Changes in the allowance for credit losses and, therefore, in related provision for credit losses (“bad debt expense”) can materially affect earnings. Credit risk characteristics are assessed for each receivable segment. In applying the judgment and review required to determine the allowance for credit losses, management considers a number of factors, including receivable volumes, receivable delinquency status, historical loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as macro-economic conditions. While our methodology attributes portions of the allowance to specific portfolio segments, the entire allowance for credit losses is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total receivables portfolio.Management also considers an amount that represents management’s judgment of risks inherent in the process and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses, including process risk and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments.To the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends or assumptions, the appropriate allowance levels for realized credit losses could differ from the estimate. We write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date.We offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments over a period of up to 36 months using an EIP. EIP receivables not held for sale are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, allowance for credit losses and unamortized discounts. Receivables held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. At the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest if the EIP term exceeds 12 months as there is no stated rate of interest on the EIP receivables. The EIP receivables are recorded at their present value, which is determined by discounting future cash payments at the imputed interest rate. The difference between the recorded amount of the EIP receivables and their unpaid principal balance (i.e., the contractual amount due from the customer) results in a discount which is recorded as a reduction in transaction price and allocated to the performance obligations of the arrangement. We determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk on the EIP receivables. As a result, we do not recognize a separate credit loss allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows resulting from credit risk are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable. The imputed discount on EIP receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as Other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.Subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we assess the need for and, if necessary, recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated probable losses on the gross EIP receivable balances exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances. Total imputed discount and allowances was approximately 8.1% of the total amount of gross accounts receivable, including EIP receivables at both December 31, 2018 and 2017.Deferred Purchase Price AssetsIn connection with the sales of certain service and EIP accounts receivable pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable Level 3 inputs, including customer default rates and credit worthiness, dilutions and recoveries. See Note 4 – Sales of Certain Receivables for further information.DepreciationDepreciation commences once assets have been placed in service. We generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit. Leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to us, which is generally shorter than the lease term and considers expected losses. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. These studies consider actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate that the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book values are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful 52Table of Contentslife. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 – Property and Equipment of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management’s underlying estimates of useful lives.Evaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment We assess the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, for potential impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired.When assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. We recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. In the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. We believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value. We test spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with our management of the overall business at a national level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. If the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. We estimate fair value using the Greenfield methodology, which is an income approach, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The Greenfield methodology values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses). The value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. We base the assumptions underlying the Greenfield methodology on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. Future cash flows in the Greenfield methodology are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, EBITDA margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.The valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. If actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. The most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures and the long-term growth rate. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our annual impairment test and impairment charges.Rent ExpenseWe have operating leases for cell sites, retail locations, corporate offices and dedicated transportation lines, some of which have escalating rentals during the initial lease term and during subsequent optional renewal periods. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis, over the non-cancelable lease term and renewal periods that are considered reasonably assured at the inception of the lease. We consider several factors in assessing whether renewal periods are reasonably assured of being exercised, including the continued maturation of our network nationwide, technological advances within the telecommunications industry and the availability of alternative sites. 53Table of ContentsIncome TaxesDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available. We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedSee Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to economic risks in the normal course of business, primarily from changes in interest rates, including changes in investment yields and changes in spreads due to credit risk and other factors. These risks, along with other business risks, impact our cost of capital. Our policy is to manage exposure related to fluctuations in interest rates in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term. We have established interest rate risk limits that are closely monitored by measuring interest rate sensitivities of our debt portfolio. We do not foresee significant changes in the strategies used to manage market risk in the near future.We are exposed to changes in interest rates on our Incremental Term Loan Facility with DT, our majority stockholder. See Note 8 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.To perform the sensitivity analysis, we selected hypothetical changes in market rates that are expected to reflect reasonably possible near-term changes in those rates. We assessed the risk of a change in the fair value from the effect of a hypothetical interest rate change for 30-day LIBOR rates of positive 150 and negative 50 basis points. In cases where the debt is redeemable and the fair value calculation results in a liability greater than the cost to replace the debt, the maximum liability is assumed to be no greater than the current cost to redeem the debt. As of December 31, 2018, the change in the fair value of our Incremental Term Loan Facility, based on this hypothetical change, is shown in the table below: Carrying Amount Fair Value Fair Value Assuming(in millions)+150 Basis Point Shift -50 Basis Point ShiftLIBOR plus 1.50% Senior Secured Term Loan due 2022$2,000 $1,991 $1,933 $2,011LIBOR plus 1.75% Senior Secured Term Loan due 20242,000 1,985 1,913 2,010We are exposed to changes in the benchmark interest rate associated with our interest rate lock derivatives. See Note 7 – Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.To perform the sensitivity analysis, we selected hypothetical changes in market rates that are expected to reflect reasonably possible near-term changes in those rates. We assessed the risk of a change in fair value from the effect of a hypothetical interest rate change for eight and 10-year LIBOR swap rates of positive 200 and negative 100 basis points. As of December 31, 2018, the change in the fair value of our interest rate lock derivatives, based on this hypothetical change, is show in the table below: Fair Value Fair Value Assuming(in millions)+200 Basis Point Shift -100 Basis Point ShiftInterest rate lock derivatives$(447) $1,007 $(1,303)54Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:44:20.570528

T-Mobile’s 5G network works indoors and is available to anyone with a capable device.Spectrum PositionWe provide wireless communications services utilizing mid-band spectrum licenses, such as Advanced Wireless Services (“AWS”) and Personal Communications Service (“PCS”), low-band spectrum licenses utilizing our 600 MHz and 700 MHz spectrum, and mmWave spectrum.•We owned an average of 111 MHz of spectrum nationwide as of December 31, 2019, not including mmWave spectrum. The spectrum comprises an average of 31 MHz in the 600 MHz band, 10 MHz in the 700 MHz band, 29 MHz in the 1900 MHz PCS band and 41 MHz in the AWS band. •We have cleared 600 MHz spectrum covering approximately 275 million POPs as of December 31, 2019 and expect to clear the remaining 600 MHz spectrum POPs in 2020.•We continue our deployment of LTE on 600 MHz spectrum using 5G-ready equipment. As of December 31, 2019, we were live with 4G LTE in nearly 8,900 cities and towns in 49 states and Puerto Rico covering 1.5 million square miles and 248 million POPs.•Combining 600 and 700 MHz spectrum, we have deployed 4G LTE in low-band spectrum to 316 million POPs.•Currently, more than 33 million devices on T-Mobile’s network are compatible with 600 MHz spectrum.•On June 3, 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) announced the results of Auctions 101 (28 GHz spectrum) and 102 (24 GHz spectrum). In the combined auctions, T-Mobile spent $842 million to more than quadruple its nationwide average total mmWave spectrum holdings from 104 MHz to 471 MHz. •We will evaluate future spectrum purchases in current and upcoming auctions and in the secondary market to further augment our current spectrum position. We are not aware of any such spectrum purchase options that come close to matching the efficiencies and synergies possible from the Merger.Network Coverage Growth•We continue to expand our coverage breadth and covered 327 million people with 4G LTE as of December 31, 2019;•Our nationwide 5G network covered more than 200 million people as of December 31, 2019; and•As of December 31, 2019, we had equipment deployed on approximately 66,000 macro cell sites and 25,000 small cell/distributed antenna system sites. Network Capacity Growth Due to industry spectrum limitations (especially in mid-band), we continue to make efforts to expand our capacity and increase the quality of our network through the re-farming of existing spectrum and implementation of new technologies including Voice over LTE (“VoLTE”), Carrier Aggregation, 4x4 multiple-input and multiple-output (“MIMO”), 256 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (“QAM”) and Licensed Assisted Access (“LAA”).•VoLTE comprised 90% of total voice calls in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to 87% in the fourth quarter of 2018. •Carrier aggregation is live for our customers in 969 markets as of December 31, 2019, up from 923 markets as of December 31, 2018. •4x4 MIMO is currently available in 708 markets as of December 31, 2019, up from 564 markets as of December 31, 2018.7Table of Contents•Our customers have 256 QAM available across the Un-carrier's entire 4G LTE footprint. •We are the first carrier globally to have rolled out the combination of carrier aggregation, 4x4 MIMO and 256 QAM.

We are the third largest provider of postpaid service plans and the second largest provider of prepaid service plans in the U.S. as measured by customers. Our competitors include other national carriers, such as AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”), Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”) and Sprint. AT&T and Verizon are significantly larger than we are and enjoy greater resources and scale advantages as compared to us. In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller regional carriers, mobile virtual network operators (“MVNOs”), including TracFone Wireless, Inc., Comcast Corporation, Charter Communications, Inc., and Altice USA, Inc., many of which offer no-contract, postpaid and prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice, messaging and data services, using alternative technologies or services. Competitive factors within the wireless communications services industry include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies, availability of additional spectrum licenses and regulatory changes. Some competitors have shown a willingness to use aggressive pricing as a source of differentiation. Other competitors have sought to add ancillary services, like mobile video or music streaming services, to enhance their offerings. Taken together, the competitive factors we face continue to put pressure on growth and margins as companies compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customers.EmployeesAs of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 53,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions.Regulation The FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The FCC has a number of complex requirements that affect our operations and pending proceedings regarding additional or modified requirements that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection, and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly. Except for operations in certain unlicensed frequency bands, wireless communications services providers generally must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10-15 years depending on the particular licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, Congress’ and the FCC’s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (“CMRS”), which includes cellular, PCS, miscellaneous wireless services and specialized mobile radio, could significantly increase and intensify competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market 8Table of Contentsdevelopments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers’ spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers. Congress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership through an entity controlling the licensee. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest, but must be reviewed and approved. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our Company by DT. This declaratory ruling, and our licenses, are conditioned on DT’s and the Company’s compliance with a network security agreement with the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security. Failure to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation of our spectrum licenses.While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communications services providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of devices while driving, zoning and land use. Additionally, after the FCC’s adoption of the 2017 “Restoring Internet Freedom” (RIF) Order reclassifying broadband internet access services as Title I (non-common carrier services), a number of states have sought to impose state-specific net neutrality and privacy requirements on providers’ broadband services. The FCC ruling broadly preempted such state efforts, which are inconsistent with the FCC’s federal deregulatory approach. Recently, however, the DC Circuit issued a ruling largely upholding the RIF Order, but also vacating the portion of the ruling broadly preempting state/local net neutrality laws. The court left open the prospect that particular state laws could still unlawfully conflict with the FCC net neutrality rules and be preempted. A petition seeking rehearing of the decision has been filed. Court challenges to some of the state enactments also remain pending. While most states are largely seeking to codify the repealed federal rules, there are differences in some states, notably California, which has passed separate privacy and net neutrality legislation. There are also efforts within Congress to pass federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirements, while also ensuring the preemption of separate state requirements, including the California laws. If not rescinded, separate state requirements will impose significant business costs and could also result in increased litigation costs and enforcement risks. State authority over wireless broadband services will remain unsettled until final action by the courts or Congress.In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other federal agencies have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are to some extent unknown and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.

The information on our websites is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC.Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating T-Mobile. Our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results, as well as the price of our common stock and other securities, could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.9Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our Business and the Wireless IndustryCompetition, industry consolidation, and changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We have multiple wireless competitors, some of which have greater resources than we have and compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings, price, network coverage, speed and quality and customer service. We expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry’s customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rates, or possibly negative, leading to ongoing competition for customers. We also expect that our customers’ appetite for data services will place increasing demands on our network capacity. This competition and our capacity will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers. Our ability to compete will depend on, among other things, continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality and customer service, effective marketing and selling of products and services, innovation, attractive pricing, and cost management, all of which will involve significant expenses.Joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances in the wireless sector have resulted in and are expected to result in larger competitors competing for a limited number of customers. The two largest national wireless communications services providers currently serve a significant percentage of all wireless customers and hold significant spectrum and other resources. Our largest competitors may be able to enter into exclusive handset, device, or content arrangements, execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaigns, or otherwise improve their cost position relative to ours. In addition, refusal of our large competitors to provide critical access to resources and inputs, such as roaming services on reasonable terms could improve their position within the wireless broadband mobile services industry.We face intense and increasing competition from other service providers as industry sectors converge, such as cable, telecom services and content, satellite, and other service providers. Companies like Comcast and AT&T (with acquisitions of DirecTV and Time Warner, Inc.) will have the scale and assets to aggressively compete in a converging industry. Verizon, through its acquisitions of AOL, Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. is also a significant competitor focusing on premium content offerings to diversify outside of core wireless. Further, some of our competitors now provide content services in addition to voice and broadband services, and consumers are increasingly accessing video content from Internet-based providers and applications, all of which create increased competition in this area. These factors, together with the effects of the increasing aggregate penetration of wireless services in all metropolitan areas and the ability of our larger competitors to use resources to build out their networks and to quickly deploy advanced technologies, such as 5G, could make it more difficult for us to continue to attract and retain customers, and may adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.The scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum, and regulations relating to spectrum use, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We will need to acquire additional spectrum in order to continue our customer growth, expand and deepen our coverage, maintain our quality of service, meet increasing customer demands, and deploy new technologies. We will be at a competitive disadvantage and possibly experience erosion in the quality of service in certain geographic areas if we fail to gain access to necessary spectrum before reaching network capacity. As a result, we are actively seeking to make additional investment in spectrum, which could be significant.The continued interest in, and acquisition of, spectrum by existing carriers and others may reduce our ability to acquire and/or increase the cost of acquiring spectrum in the secondary market or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other means, including government auctions. We may need to enter into spectrum sharing or leasing arrangements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and may involve significant expenditures. In addition, our return on investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customers and to provide additional services and usage to existing customers. As a result, the return on any investment in spectrum that we make may not be as much as we anticipate or take longer than expected. Additionally, the FCC may not be able to provide sufficient additional spectrum to auction or we may be unable to secure the spectrum we need in any auction we may elect to participate in or in the secondary market, on favorable terms or at all.The FCC may impose conditions on the use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas. Additional conditions that may be imposed by the FCC include heightened build-out requirements, limited license terms or renewal rights, and clearing obligations that may make it less attractive or less economical to acquire spectrum. In addition, rules may be established for future government 10Table of Contentsspectrum auctions that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas.If we cannot acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise, if competitors acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide services competitive with our services, or if we cannot deploy services over acquired spectrum on a timely basis without burdensome conditions, at reasonable cost, and while maintaining network quality levels, then our ability to attract and retain customers and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy.Significant technological changes continue to impact the communications industry. In general, these technological changes enhance communications and enable a broader array of companies to offer services competitive with ours. In order to grow and remain competitive with new and evolving technologies in our industry, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, continually invest in our network, increase network capacity, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings to address our current and potential customers’ changing demands. Enhancing our network, including our 5G network, is subject to risk from equipment changes and migration of customers from older technologies and the potential inability to secure mid-band 5G spectrum that is necessary to add capacity to advanced technologies. Adopting new and sophisticated technologies may result in implementation issues such as scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints, regulatory permitting issues, customer dissatisfaction, and other issues that could cause delays in launching new technological capabilities, which in turn could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the upgrades. In general, the development of new services in the wireless telecommunications industry will require us to anticipate and respond to the continuously changing demands of our customers, which we may not be able to do accurately or timely. If our new services fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with these services are higher than anticipated, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches, whether directly or indirectly.Our business, like that of most retailers and wireless companies, involves the receipt, storage, and transmission of our customers’ confidential information, including sensitive personal information and payment card information, confidential information about our employees and suppliers, and other sensitive information about our Company, such as our business plans, transactions and intellectual property (“Confidential Information”). Unauthorized access to Confidential Information may be difficult to anticipate, detect, or prevent, particularly given that the methods of unauthorized access constantly change and evolve. We are subject to the threat of unauthorized access or disclosure of Confidential Information by state-sponsored parties, malicious actors, third parties or employees, errors or breaches by third-party suppliers, or other security incidents that could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of Confidential Information. In August 2018 and November 2019, we notified affected customers of incidents involving unauthorized access to certain customer information (not involving credit card information, financial data, social security numbers or passwords). While we do not believe these security incidents were material, we expect to continue to be the target of cyber-attacks, data breaches, or security incidents, which may in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.Cyber-attacks, such as denial of service and other malicious attacks, could disrupt our internal systems and applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers, and have other adverse effects on our business and that of others who depend on our services. As a telecommunications carrier, we are considered a critical infrastructure provider and therefore may be more likely to be the target of such attacks. Such attacks against companies may be perpetrated by a variety of groups or persons, including those in jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are ineffective or unavailable, and such attacks may even be perpetrated by or at the behest of foreign governments.In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third-party service providers as part of our business operations. These third-party service providers have experienced data breaches and other attacks that included unauthorized access to Confidential Information in the past, and face security challenges common to all parties that collect and process information. Past data breaches include a breach of the networks of one of our credit decisioning providers in September 2015, during which a subset of records containing current and potential customer information was acquired by an external party.Our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and to defend against attacks seeking to disrupt our services must be continually evaluated and revised to address the ever-evolving threat landscape. We cannot make assurances that all preventive actions taken will adequately repel a significant attack or prevent information security breaches or the misuses of data, unauthorized access by third parties or employees, or exploits against third-party supplier environments. If 11Table of Contentswe or our third-party suppliers are subject to such attacks or security breaches, we may incur significant costs or other material financial impacts, which may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, our cyber insurance, be subject to regulatory investigations, sanctions and private litigation, experience disruptions to our operations or suffer damage to our reputation. Any future cyber-attacks, data breaches, or security incidents may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.System failures and business disruptions may allow unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other systems which could materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.To be successful, we must provide our customers with reliable, trustworthy service and protect the communications, location, and personal information shared or generated by our customers. We rely upon both our systems and networks and the systems and networks of other providers and suppliers to provide and support our services and, in some cases, protect our customers’ information and our information. Failure of our or others’ systems, networks, or infrastructure may prevent us from providing reliable service or may allow for the unauthorized use of or interference with our networks and other systems or for the compromise of customer information. Examples of these risks include:•human error such as responding to deceptive communications or unintentionally executing malicious code;•physical damage, power surges or outages, or equipment failure, including those as a result of severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, political instability and volatility, and acts of war;•theft of customer and/or proprietary information offered for sale for competitive advantage or corporate extortion;•unauthorized access to our IT and business systems or to our network and critical infrastructure and those of our suppliers and other providers;•supplier failures or delays; and•system failures or outages of our business systems or communications network.Such events could cause us to lose customers, lose revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational damage, and subject us to litigation or governmental investigation. Remediation costs could include liability for information loss, repairing infrastructure and systems, and/or costs of incentives offered to customers. Our insurance may not cover, or be adequate to fully reimburse us for, costs and losses associated with such events.We continue implementing a new billing system, which will support a portion of our subscribers, while maintaining our legacy billing systems. Any unanticipated difficulties, disruption, or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial, and reputational effects on our business. We continue implementing a new customer billing system, that involves a new third-party supported platform and utilization of a phased deployment approach. Elements of the billing system have been placed into service and are operational and we plan to operate both the existing and new billing systems in parallel to aid in the transition to the new system until all phases of the conversion are complete.The ongoing implementation may cause major system or business disruptions, or we may fail to implement the new billing system in its entirety or in a timely or effective manner. In addition, we or the supporting vendor may experience errors, cyber-attacks, or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact us and over which we may have limited control. Interruptions and/or failure of this billing services system could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to provide or bill for our services, retain customers, attract new customers, or negatively impact overall customer experience. Any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and reputational damage.We rely on third parties to provide products and services for the operation of our business, and the failure or inability of such parties to provide these products or services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We depend heavily on suppliers, service providers, their subcontractors and other third parties for us to efficiently operate our business. Due to the complexity of our business, it is not unusual to engage a diverse set of suppliers to help us develop, maintain, and troubleshoot products and services such as network components, software development services, and billing and customer service support. Some of our suppliers may provide services from outside of the United States, which carries additional regulatory and legal obligations. We commonly rely on suppliers to provide us with contractual assurances and to disclose accurate information regarding risks associated with their provision of products or services in accordance with our 12Table of Contentspolicies and standards, including our Supplier Code of Conduct and our third party-risk management practices. The failure of our suppliers to comply with our expectations and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Many of the products and services we use are available through multiple sources and suppliers. However, there are a limited number of suppliers who can support or provide billing services, voice and data communications transport services, network infrastructure, equipment, handsets, other devices, and payment processing services, among other products and services. Disruptions or failure of such suppliers to adequately perform could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In the past, our suppliers, service providers and their subcontractors may not have always performed at the levels we expected or at the levels required by their contracts. Our business could be severely disrupted if critical suppliers or service providers fail to comply with their contracts or if we experience delays or service degradation during any transition to a new outsourcing provider or other supplier or if we are required to replace the supplied products or services with those from another source, especially if the replacement becomes necessary on short notice. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Economic, political, and market conditions may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results, as well as our access to financing on favorable terms or at all. Our business, financial condition, and operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, rates of inflation (or concerns about deflation), unemployment rates, economic growth, energy costs, and other macro-economic factors. Difficult, or worsening, general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Market volatility, political and economic uncertainty, and weak economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results in a number of ways. Our services and device financing plans are available to a broad customer base, a significant segment of which may be more vulnerable to weak economic conditions, particularly our subprime customers. We may have greater difficulty in gaining new customers within this segment, and existing customers may be more likely to terminate service and default on device financing plans due to an inability to pay.Weak economic conditions and credit conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers, dealers, and MVNOs, some of which may file for or may be considering bankruptcy, or may experience cash flow or liquidity problems, or may be unable to obtain or refinance credit such that they may no longer be able to operate. Any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market, or sell our products and services.In addition, instability in the global financial markets could lead to periodic volatility in the credit, equity, and fixed income markets. This volatility could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financing arrangements include restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility.The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financing arrangements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions, and incurrence-based ratio tests, may limit our or our subsidiaries’ ability to pursue strategic business opportunities and engage in certain transactions, including the following:•incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock;•paying dividends, redeeming capital stock, or making other restricted payments or investments;•selling or buying assets, properties, or licenses;•developing assets, properties, or licenses that we have or in the future may procure;•creating liens on assets securing indebtedness or other obligations;•participating in future FCC auctions of spectrum or private sales of spectrum; •engaging in mergers, acquisitions, business combinations, or other transactions;•entering into transactions with affiliates; and13Table of Contents•placing restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments.These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain debt financing, engage in share repurchases, refinance or pay principal on our outstanding indebtedness, complete acquisitions for cash or indebtedness or react to business, economic, market and industry conditions and other changes in our operating environment or the economy. Any future indebtedness that we incur may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our debt agreements and other financing arrangements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these and other agreements, giving our lenders the right to terminate any commitments they had made to provide us with further funds and to require us to repay all amounts then outstanding plus any interest, fees, penalties or premiums, which may require us to sell certain assets securing indebtedness. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Our ability to make payments on our debt, to repay our existing indebtedness when due, to fund our capital-intensive business and operations, and to make significant planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is in turn subject to the operational risks described elsewhere in this report. Our debt service obligations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and operating results, including by:•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the communications industry or pursuing growth opportunities;•reducing the amount of cash available for other operational or strategic needs; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors who are less leveraged than we are.Any hedging agreements we have and may continue to enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations may not offer complete protection from these risks or may be unsuccessful, and consequently may effectively increase the interest rate we pay on our debt or the exchange rate with respect to such debt, and any portion not subject to such hedging agreements would have full exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations, as applicable.We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our hedging agreements. The primary credit exposure that we have with respect to our hedging agreements is that a counterparty will default on payments due, which could result in us having to acquire a replacement derivative from a different counterparty at a higher cost or we may be unable to find a suitable replacement. The counterparties to our hedging agreements are all major financial institutions; however, this does not eliminate our exposure to credit risk with these institutions. In addition, any netting and/or set off rights we may have through master netting arrangements with these counterparties may not apply to affiliates of a counterparty with whom we may have various other financial arrangements. If any financial institutions that are parties to our hedging agreements were to default on their payment obligations to us, declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, we would be unhedged against the underlying exposures. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, under some of our hedging agreements, the counterparties’ and our obligations are required to be secured by cash or U.S. Treasury securities, subject to defined thresholds. Any additional posting of collateral by us under these arrangements would negatively impact our liquidity. The modification or termination of our hedging agreements could also negatively impact our liquidity or other financial metrics.Some of our debt has a variable rate of interest linked to various indices. If the changes in indices result in interest rate increases, our debt service requirements will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. In particular, some or all of our variable-rate indebtedness may use the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or similar rates as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR will be discontinued after 2021 and will be replaced with an alternative reference rate. The consequence of this development cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could result in a loss of investor confidence regarding our financial statements or may have a material adverse effect on our business.Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we along with our independently registered public accounting firm are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We rely heavily on IT systems and, manual and automated processes as an important part of our internal controls in order to operate, transact, and otherwise manage our business, as well as provide effective and timely reporting of our financial results. Failure to design and maintain effective internal controls, including those over our IT systems, could constitute a material weakness that could result in 14Table of Contentsinaccurate financial statements, inaccurate disclosures, or failure to prevent fraud. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm were unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence regarding our financial statements and our business could be materially adversely affected.Our financial condition and operating results will be impaired if we experience high fraud rates related to device financing, credit cards, dealers, or subscriptions.Our operating costs could increase substantially as a result of fraud, including any fraud related to device financing, customer credit card, subscriptions, or dealers. If our fraud detection strategies and processes are not successful in detecting and controlling fraud, whether directly or by way of the systems, processes, and operations of third parties such as national retailers, dealers, and others, the resulting loss of revenue or increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.We rely on highly skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture.The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly-skilled personnel for all areas of our organization, including our CEO, the other members of our senior leadership team and highly skilled employees in technical, marketing and staff positions. Doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, changes to U.S. immigration policy, competitors’ hiring practices, employee tolerance for the significant amount of change within and demands on our Company and our industry, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain and motivate our existing employees and to attract new employees. If we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employees and attracting new key personnel, we may not be able to meet our business plan and, as a result, our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected. In addition, certain members of our senior leadership team, including our CEO, have term employment agreements with us. Our inability to extend the terms of these employment agreements or to replace these members or our senior leadership team at the end of their terms with qualified and capable successors could hinder our strategic planning and execution. In November 2019, we announced that John Legere would retire as our Chief Executive Officer on April 30, 2020. Our ability to execute our business strategies and retain key executives may be adversely affected by the transition to our successor, Michael Sievert.Any acquisition, investment, or merger may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business.We may pursue acquisitions of, investments in or mergers with businesses, technologies, services and/or products that complement or expand our business. Some of these potential transactions could be significant relative to the size of our business and operations. Any such transaction would involve a number of risks and could present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:•diversion of management attention from running our existing business;•increased costs to integrate the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the business involved in any such transaction with our business;•difficulties in effectively integrating the financial and operational systems of the business involved in any such transaction into (or supplanting such systems with) our financial and operational reporting infrastructure and internal control framework in an effective and timely manner;•potential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process or as a result of any litigation arising in connection with any such transaction;•significant transaction expenses in connection with any such transaction, whether consummated or not;•risks related to our ability to obtain any required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate any such transaction;•acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and any such financing could significantly increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings; and•any business, technology, service, or product involved in any such transaction may significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from the transaction, which could, among other things, also result in a write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with such transaction.For any or all of these reasons, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment, or merger may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.15Table of ContentsRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory MattersChanges in regulations or in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale, and interconnection of wireless communications systems, as do some state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and the resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. Additionally, the FTC and other federal and state agencies have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection, and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of wireless products and services. We are subject to regulatory oversight by various federal, state and local agencies, as well as judicial review and actions, on issues related to the wireless industry that include, but are not limited to: roaming, interconnection, spectrum allocation and licensing, facilities siting, pole attachments, intercarrier compensation, Universal Service Fund (“USF”), net neutrality, 911 services, consumer protection, consumer privacy, and cybersecurity. We are also subject to regulations in connection with other aspects of our business, including handset financing and insurance activities.We cannot assure you that the FCC or any other federal, state or local agencies will not adopt regulations or take enforcement or other actions that would adversely affect our business, impose new costs, or require changes in current or planned operations. For example, under the Obama administration, the FCC established net neutrality and privacy regimes that applied to our operations. Both sets of rules potentially subjected some of our initiatives and practices to more burdensome requirements and heightened scrutiny by federal and state regulators, the public, edge providers, and private litigants regarding whether such initiatives or practices are compliant. While the FCC rules are now largely rolled back under the Trump administration, some states and other jurisdictions have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws in these areas (including for example the CCPA cited below), perpetuating the risk and uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment and compliance around these issues.In addition, states are increasingly focused on the quality of service and support that wireless communications services providers provide to their customers and several states have proposed or enacted new and potentially burdensome regulations in this area. We also face potential investigations by, and inquiries from or actions by state public utility commissions. We also cannot assure you that Congress will not amend the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, and which serves to limit state authority, or enact other legislation in a manner that could be adverse to our business. Additionally, in June 2018, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) effective January 2020, creating new data privacy rights for California residents and new compliance obligations for us. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant implementation costs to ensure compliance with the CCPA, and we could see increased litigation costs with the law now in effect. The California Attorney General has proposed related CCPA regulations, which could be adopted in a form that increases our costs and/or litigation exposure. If we are unable to put proper controls and procedures in place to ensure compliance, it could have an adverse effect on our business. A California ballot initiative has recently been introduced by the original proponent of the CCPA that would provide additional data privacy rights and require additional implementation processes if passed. Other states, such as Nevada and Washington, have passed or are considering similar legislation, which, if passed, could create more risks and potential costs for us, especially to the extent the specific requirements of these laws vary significantly from those in California, Nevada and other existing laws. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We could be subject to fines, forfeitures, and other penalties (including, in extreme cases, revocation of our spectrum licenses) for failure to comply with FCC or other governmental regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.Unfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We are regularly involved in a number of legal proceedings before various state and federal courts, the FCC, the FTC, other federal agencies, and state and local regulatory agencies, including state attorneys general. Such legal proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energy of management and other key personnel. The assessment of the outcome of legal proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or pursuant to final judgment, order or decree may differ materially from amounts accrued in our financial statements. In addition, litigation or similar proceedings could impose restraints on our current or future manner of 16Table of Contentsdoing business. Such potential outcomes including judgments, awards, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We offer highly regulated financial services products. These products expose us to a wide variety of state and federal regulations.The financing of devices, through our EIP and JUMP! On Demand programs, has expanded our regulatory compliance obligations. Failure to remain compliant with applicable regulations, may increase our risk exposure in the following areas:•consumer complaints and potential examinations or enforcement actions by federal and state regulatory agencies, including but not limited to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, state attorneys general, the FCC and the FTC; and•regulatory fines, penalties, enforcement actions, civil litigation, and/or class action lawsuits.Failure to comply with applicable regulations and the realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.We may not be able to adequately protect the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.We rely on a combination of patent, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which offer only limited protection. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary rights. We may not have the ability in certain jurisdictions to adequately protect intellectual property rights. Moreover, others may independently develop processes and technologies that are competitive to ours. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. We cannot be sure that any legal actions against such infringers will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. We cannot assure you that our pending or future patent applications will be granted or enforceable, or that the rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide us with any competitive advantages. In addition, we cannot assure you that any trademark or service mark registrations will be issued with respect to pending or future applications or will provide adequate protection of our brands. We do not have insurance coverage for intellectual property losses, and as such, a charge for an anticipated settlement or an adverse ruling awarding damages represents an unplanned loss event. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. We are a defendant in numerous intellectual property lawsuits, including patent infringement lawsuits, which exposes us to the risk of adverse financial impact either by way of significant settlement amounts or damage awards. As we adopt new technologies and new business systems and provide customers with new products and/or services, we may face additional infringement claims. These claims could require us to cease certain activities or to cease selling relevant products and services. These claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend, and divert management resources, and expose us to significant damages awards or settlements, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. In addition to litigation directly involving our Company, our vendors and suppliers can be threatened with patent litigation and/or subjected to the threat of disruption or blockage of sale, use, or importation of products, posing the risk of supply chain interruption to particular products and associated services which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Our business may be impacted by new or amended tax laws or regulations, judicial interpretations of same or administrative actions by federal, state, and/or local taxing authorities.In connection with the products and services we sell, we calculate, collect, and remit various federal, state, and local taxes, fees and regulatory charges (“tax” or “taxes”) to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including federal USF contributions and common carrier regulatory fees. In addition, we incur and pay state and local taxes and fees on purchases of goods and services used in our business.Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In many cases, the application of existing, newly enacted or amended tax laws (such as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) may be uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services, such as broadband internet access and cloud related services. Changes in tax laws could also impact revenue reported on tax inclusive plans.17Table of ContentsIn the event that we have incorrectly described, disclosed, determined, calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts that were due to governmental authorities, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In the event that federal, state, and/or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes on our network, operations, or services, or seek to impose new taxes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Our wireless licenses are subject to renewal and may be revoked in the event that we violate applicable laws.Our existing wireless licenses are subject to renewal upon the expiration of the 10-year or 15-year period for which they are granted. Historically, the FCC has approved our license renewal applications. However, the Communications Act provides that licenses may be revoked for cause and license renewal applications denied if the FCC determines that a renewal would not serve the public interest. In addition, our licenses are subject to our compliance with the terms set forth in the agreement pertaining to national security among us, DT, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security. The failure of DT or the Company to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation or non-renewal of our spectrum licenses. If we fail to timely file to renew any wireless license or fail to meet any regulatory requirements for renewal, including construction and substantial service requirements, we could be denied a license renewal. Many of our wireless licenses are subject to interim or final construction requirements and there is no guarantee that the FCC will find our construction, or the construction of prior licensees, sufficient to meet the build-out or renewal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the FCC will renew our wireless licenses upon their expiration. If any of our wireless licenses were to be revoked or not renewed upon expiration, we would not be permitted to provide services under that license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Our business could be adversely affected by findings of product liability for health or safety risks from wireless devices and transmission equipment, as well as by changes to regulations or radio frequency emission standards.We do not manufacture the devices or other equipment that we sell, and we depend on our suppliers to provide defect-free and safe equipment. Suppliers are required by applicable law to manufacture their devices to meet certain governmentally imposed safety criteria. However, even if the devices we sell meet the regulatory safety criteria, we could be held liable with the equipment manufacturers and suppliers for any harm caused by products we sell if such products are later found to have design or manufacturing defects. We generally seek to enter into indemnification agreements with the manufacturers who supply us with devices to protect us from losses associated with product liability, but we cannot guarantee that we will be protected in whole or in part against losses associated with a product that is found to be defective.Allegations have been made that the use of wireless handsets and wireless transmission equipment, such as cell towers, may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer and brain tumors. Lawsuits have been filed against manufacturers and carriers in the industry claiming damages for alleged health problems arising from the use of wireless handsets. In addition, the FCC has from time to time gathered data regarding wireless handset emissions and its assessment of this issue may evolve based on its findings. The media has also reported incidents of handset battery malfunction, including reports of batteries that have overheated. These allegations may lead to changes in regulatory standards. There have also been other allegations regarding wireless technology, including allegations that wireless handset emissions may interfere with various electronic medical devices (including hearing aids and pacemakers), airbags and anti-lock brakes. Defects in the products of our suppliers, such as the 2016 recall by a handset original equipment manufacturer of one of its smartphone devices, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Any of these allegations or risks could result in customers purchasing fewer devices and wireless services, and could also result in significant legal and regulatory liability.Additionally, there are safety risks associated with the use of wireless devices while operating vehicles or equipment. Concerns over any of these risks and the effect of any legislation, rules or regulations that have been and may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to sell our wireless services.Risks Related to Ownership of our Common StockWe are controlled by DT, whose interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders.DT beneficially owns and possesses majority voting power of the fully diluted shares of our common stock. Through its control of the voting power of our common stock and the rights granted to DT in our certificate of incorporation and the Stockholder’s Agreement, DT controls the election of our directors and all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. By virtue of DT’s voting control, we are a “controlled company,” as defined in The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) listing 18Table of Contentsrules, and are not subject to NASDAQ requirements that would otherwise require us to have a majority of independent directors, a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors. Accordingly, our stockholders will not be afforded the same protections generally as stockholders of other NASDAQ-listed companies with respect to corporate governance for so long as we rely on these exemptions from the corporate governance requirements.In addition, our certificate of incorporation and the Stockholder’s Agreement restrict us from taking certain actions without DT’s prior written consent as long as DT beneficially owns 30% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including:•the incurrence of debt (excluding certain permitted debt) if our consolidated ratio of debt to cash flow, as defined in the indenture dated April 28, 2013, for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available would exceed 5.25 to 1.0 on a pro forma basis;•the acquisition of any business, debt or equity interests, operations or assets of any person for consideration in excess of $1.0 billion;•the sale of any of our or our subsidiaries’ divisions, businesses, operations or equity interests for consideration in excess of $1.0 billion;•the incurrence of secured debt (excluding certain permitted secured debt);•any change in the size of our Board of Directors;•the issuances of equity securities in excess of 10% of our outstanding shares or to repurchase debt held by DT;•the repurchase or redemption of equity securities or the declaration of extraordinary or in-kind dividends or distributions other than on a pro rata basis; and•the termination or hiring of our chief executive officer.These restrictions could prevent us from taking actions that our Board of Directors may otherwise determine are in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders or that may be in the best interests of our other stockholders.DT effectively has control over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, changes to our certificate of incorporation, a sale or merger of our Company and other transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law. DT’s controlling interest may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, the Company. DT may have strategic, financial, or other interests different from our other stockholders, including as the holder of a substantial amount of our indebtedness and as the counter-party in a number of commercial arrangements, and may make decisions adverse to the interests of our other stockholders.In addition, we license certain trademarks from DT, including the right to use the trademark “T-Mobile” as a name for the Company and our flagship brand, under a trademark license agreement with DT. As described in more detail in our proxy statement under the heading “Transactions with Related Persons and Approval,” we are obligated under the trademark license agreement to pay DT a royalty in an amount equal to 0.25%, which we refer to as the royalty rate, of the net revenue (as defined in the trademark license) generated by products and services we sell under the licensed trademarks. The trademark license agreement includes a royalty rate adjustment mechanism that would have occurred in early 2018 and potentially resulted in a new royalty rate effective in January 2019. The license agreement includes a royalty rate adjustment mechanism that has been postponed until the conclusion of the proposed Sprint Merger. The current royalty rate will remain effective until that time. The royalty rate under the license agreement will be adjusted retroactively if the Business Combination Agreement is terminated. We also have the right to terminate the trademark license upon one year’s prior notice. An increase in the royalty rate or termination of the trademark license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Future sales or issuances of our common stock, including sales by DT, could have a negative impact on our stock price.We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares or the availability of shares of our common stock will have on the prevailing trading price of our common stock from time to time. Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline and could result in dilution of your shares.We and DT are parties to the Stockholder’s Agreement pursuant to which DT is free to transfer its shares in public sales without notice, as long as such transactions would not result in the transferee owning 30% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If a transfer would exceed the 30% threshold, it is prohibited unless the transferee makes a binding offer to 19Table of Contentspurchase all of the other outstanding shares on the same price and terms. The Stockholder’s Agreement does not otherwise impose any other restrictions on the sales of common stock by DT. Moreover, we may be required to file a shelf registration statement with respect to the common stock and certain debt securities held by DT, which would facilitate the resale by DT of all or any portion of the shares of our common stock it holds. The sale of shares of our common stock by DT (other than in transactions involving the purchase of all of our outstanding shares) could significantly increase the number of shares available in the market, which could cause a decrease in our stock price. In addition, even if DT does not sell a large number of its shares into the market, its right to transfer a large number of shares into the market may depress our stock price.Our stock price may be volatile and may fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results.The trading prices of the securities of communications companies historically have been highly volatile, and the trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations. Our stock price may fluctuate in reaction to a number of events and factors that may include, among other things:•our or our competitors’ actual or anticipated operating and financial results; •introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors or changes in service plans or pricing by us or our competitors;•analyst projections, predictions and forecasts, analyst target prices for our securities and changes in, or our failure to meet, securities analysts’ expectations;•transaction in our common stock by major investors;•share repurchases by us or purchases by DT;•DT’s financial performance, results of operation, or actions implied or taken by DT;•entry of new competitors into our markets or perceptions of increased price competition, including a price war;•our performance, including subscriber growth, and our financial and operational performance;•market perceptions relating to our services, network, handsets, and deployment of our LTE and 5G platforms and our access to iconic handsets, services, applications, or content;•market perceptions of the wireless communications services industry and valuation models for us and the industry;•conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry sectors in which we operate;•changes in our credit rating or future prospects;•changes in interest rates;•changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;•the availability or perceived availability of additional capital in general and our access to such capital;•actual or anticipated consolidation, or other strategic mergers or acquisition activities involving us or our competitors, or other participants in related or adjacent industries, or market speculations regarding such activities, including the pending Merger and views of market participants regarding the likelihood the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied and the anticipated benefits of the Merger will be realized;•disruptions of our operations or service providers or other vendors necessary to our network operations; •the general state of the U.S. and world politics and economies; and•availability of additional spectrum, whether by the announcement, commencement, bidding and closing of auctions for new spectrum or the acquisition of companies that own spectrum, and the extent to which we or our competitors succeed in acquiring additional spectrum.In addition, the stock market has been volatile in the recent past and has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which may continue for the foreseeable future. This volatility has had a significant impact on the trading price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in the communications industry. These changes frequently occur irrespective of the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the trading price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results.We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our credit facilities and the indentures and supplemental indentures 20Table of Contentsgoverning our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to use future earnings, if any, to invest in our business and to fund our previously authorized stock repurchase program if the Merger fails to close.Our previously announced stock repurchase program, and any subsequent stock purchase program put in place from time to time, could affect the price of our common stock, increase the volatility of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves. Such repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.We may have in place from time to time, a stock repurchase program. Any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under any such stock repurchase program depends on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows, the price of our common stock, corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions. We may effect repurchases under any stock repurchase program from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including accelerated stock repurchase arrangements. Repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness. Additionally, our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information.Risks Related to the Proposed Transactions The closing of the Transactions is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of approval from, and the absence of any order preventing the closing issued by, governmental entities, which may not approve the Transactions, may delay the approval for, or may impose conditions or restrictions on, jeopardize or delay completion of, or reduce or delay the anticipated benefits of, the Transactions, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Transactions will not be completed.The completion of the Transactions is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, the receipt of approval from, and the absence of any legal requirements preventing the completion of the Transactions enacted or enforced by, governmental entities, including courts. As noted below, while the parties have obtained a number of approvals from governmental entities to date, the Transactions remain subject to various judicial proceedings, and the California Public Utility Commission review remains pending.In connection with the required approval for the Transactions, we have agreed to significant actions and conditions, including the planned Prepaid Transaction (as defined below) and ongoing commercial and transition services arrangements to be entered into in connection with such Prepaid Transaction, which we and Sprint announced on July 26, 2019 (collectively, the “Divestiture Transaction”), a stipulation and order and proposed final judgment with the U.S. Department of Justice, which we and Sprint announced on July 26, 2019 (the “Consent Decree”), the proposed commitments contained in the ex parte presentation filed with the Secretary of the FCC, which we and Sprint announced on May 20, 2019 (the “FCC Commitments”) and commitments and undertakings we have entered into at the federal and state level (collectively, with the Consent Decree, the FCC Commitments and any other commitments or undertakings that we have entered into and may in the future enter into with governmental authorities (including but not limited to those we have made to certain states) and nongovernmental organizations, the “Government Commitments”). All state public utility commission proceedings have been completed other than the California Public Utility Commission review, which remains pending.While the parties have received approval from the FCC, the DOJ and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States for the Transactions to proceed subject to the above-described commitments and undertakings, the Transactions remain subject to several judicial proceedings. The Consent Decree is subject to judicial approval, which proceeding is underway. The attorneys general of certain states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit in New York federal court seeking an order prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions. The trial in that case has concluded and the parties are awaiting the judge’s ruling. Another case seeking to prohibit the Transactions was filed in California federal court on behalf of individual consumers, and has been stayed pending the outcome of the New York case. Appeals of any or all of these judicial and agency actions could be filed, which could further delay the Transactions or, if the Transactions close over a pending proceeding, create 21Table of Contentsrisk and uncertainty after the Transactions close. The ultimate outcome of these matters is uncertain and there is no assurance that we will prevail or prevail in a timely manner, or whether remaining required approvals will be subject to additional required actions, conditions, limitations or restrictions on the combined company’s business, operations or assets. Such litigation, and any such additional required actions, conditions, limitations or restrictions, may prevent the completion of the Transactions, or, even if they do not prevent the completion of the Transactions, they may delay such completion, or reduce or delay the anticipated benefits of the Transactions, which could result in a material adverse effect on our or the combined company’s business, financial condition or operating results. In particular, the substantial delay in the completion of the Transactions may delay, reduce or eliminate synergies and other benefits anticipated to be realized from the Transactions and/or increase costs and expenses associated with the Transactions. In addition, because the Transactions were not completed by the “outside date” provided in the Business Combination Agreement, each of T-Mobile and Sprint may terminate the Business Combination Agreement unless the parties agree to extend such outside date, and there can be no assurance that the parties will not exercise this termination right or will agree to extend the outside date. Furthermore, the completion of the Transactions is also subject to T-Mobile USA having specified minimum credit ratings on the closing date of the Transactions (after giving effect to the Merger) from at least two of three specified credit rating agencies, subject to certain qualifications. There is no assurance that the required ratings will be obtained or that they will be obtained in a timely manner. In the event that we terminate the Business Combination Agreement in connection with a failure to satisfy the closing condition related to the specified minimum credit ratings, then in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay Sprint an amount equal to $600 million. The Business Combination Agreement may also be terminated if there is a final and non-appealable order or injunction preventing the consummation of the Transactions or the other conditions to closing are not satisfied, and we and Sprint may also mutually decide to terminate or amend the Business Combination Agreement.Failure to complete, or additional delay in the completion of, the Merger could negatively impact us and our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition or results of operations.If the completion of the Merger is prevented or continues to be delayed, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, we may be subject to a number of material risks. The price of our common stock may decline to the extent that its current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will or may be completed. In addition, significant costs related to the Transactions must be paid by us whether or not the Transactions are completed. Furthermore, we may experience negative reactions from our stockholders, customers, employees, suppliers, distributors, retailers, dealers and others who deal with us, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, it is expected that if the Merger is not completed, we will continue to lack the network, scale and financial resources of the current market share leaders in, and other companies that have more recently begun providing, wireless services. Further, if the Merger is not completed, we will need to seek access to additional wireless spectrum, in particular mid-band wireless spectrum through other sources, which if we are not successful, in turn would impact our ability to maintain (or improve) service from current levels, and to deploy a broad and deep nationwide 5G network on the same scale and on the same timeline as the combined company, and therefore limit our ability to compete effectively in the 5G era.We are subject to various uncertainties, including litigation and contractual restrictions and requirements while the Transactions are pending that could disrupt our or the combined company’s business and adversely affect our or the combined company’s business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition and results of operations.Uncertainty about whether the Transactions will be completed and/or the effect of the Transactions on employees, customers, suppliers, vendors, distributors, dealers and retailers may have an adverse effect on us or the combined company. These uncertainties may impair the ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel during the pendency of the Transactions and, whether or not the Transactions are completed, for a period of time thereafter, as existing and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us or the combined company. If key employees, including key employees of Sprint, depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, the combined company’s business following the completion of the Transactions could be negatively impacted. We or the combined company may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent. Additionally, these uncertainties could cause customers, suppliers, distributors, dealers, retailers and others to seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with us or the combined company or fail to renew existing relationships. Suppliers, distributors and content and application providers may also delay or cease developing for us or the combined company new products that are necessary for the operations of its business due to the uncertainty created by the Transactions. Competitors may also target our existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties that may result from the Transactions.22Table of ContentsThe Business Combination Agreement also restricts us, without Sprint’s consent, from taking certain actions outside of the ordinary course of business while the Transactions are pending, including, among other things, certain acquisitions or dispositions of businesses and assets, entering into or amending certain contracts, repurchasing or issuing securities, making capital expenditures, incurring indebtedness, and refinancing existing indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions. These restrictions and the inability to independently access the debt capital markets during the pendency of the Merger may have a significant negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Management and financial resources have been diverted and will continue to be diverted toward the completion of the Transactions. We have incurred, and expect to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Transactions. These costs could adversely affect our or the combined company’s financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we and our affiliates are involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, investigations and proceedings and litigation matters, including for example the antitrust litigation related to the Transactions brought by the attorneys general of certain states and the District of Columbia, and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of these matters or other future matters, could prevent the consummation of the Transactions and/or adversely affect us and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the combined company.The Business Combination Agreement contains provisions that restrict the ability of our Board to pursue alternatives to the Transactions.The Business Combination Agreement contains non-solicitation provisions that restrict our ability to solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the completion of which would constitute an alternative transaction for purposes of the Business Combination Agreement. In addition, the Business Combination Agreement does not permit us to terminate the Business Combination Agreement in order to enter into an agreement providing for, or to complete, such an alternative transaction. Furthermore, if the completion of the Transactions continues to be delayed, we or the combined company may be unable to pursue strategic opportunities or business transactions that we may otherwise pursue, such as spectrum acquisitions, share buybacks and/or debt transactions.Our directors and officers may have interests in the Transactions different from the interests of our stockholders.Certain of our directors and executive officers negotiated the terms of the Business Combination Agreement. Our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Transactions that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders. These interests include, but are not limited to, the continued service of certain of our directors as directors of the combined company, the continued employment of certain of our executive officers by the combined company, severance arrangements and employment terms linked to the Transactions and other rights held by our directors and executive officers, and provisions in the Business Combination Agreement regarding continued indemnification of and advancement of expenses to our directors and officers.Risks Related to Integration and the Combined CompanyAlthough we expect that the Transactions will result in synergies and other benefits, those synergies and benefits may not be realized or may not be realized within the expected time frame, and risks associated with the foregoing may increase as a result of the extended delay in the completion of the Transactions.Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions will depend, to a large extent, on the combined company’s ability to integrate our and Sprint’s businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the projected standalone cost savings and revenue growth trends identified by each company without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. In addition, some of the anticipated synergies are not expected to occur for a significant time period following the completion of the Transactions and will require substantial capital expenditures in the near term to be fully realized. Moreover, additional delay in the completion of the Transactions may delay, reduce or eliminate the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the Transactions, including as a result of the delay in the integration of, or inability to integrate, the networks of T-Mobile and Sprint to launch a broad and deep nationwide 5G network and increasing costs and expenses incurred by T-Mobile and Sprint during the pendency of the Transactions. Even if the combined company is able to integrate the two companies successfully, the anticipated benefits of the Transactions, including the expected synergies and network benefits, may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.Our business and Sprint’s business may not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected. Operating costs, customer loss and business disruption, including difficulties in 23Table of Contentscompleting the Divestiture Transaction, satisfying all of the Government Commitments and maintaining relationships with employees, customers, suppliers or vendors, may be greater than expected following the Transactions. Revenues following the Transactions may be lower than expected.The combination of two independent businesses is complex, costly and time-consuming and may divert significant management attention and resources to combining our and Sprint’s business practices and operations. This process, as well as the Divestiture Transaction and the Government Commitments, may disrupt our business or otherwise impact our ability to compete. The failure to meet the challenges involved in combining our and Sprint’s businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined company and could adversely affect the results of operations of the combined company. The overall combination of our and Sprint’s businesses, the completion of the Divestiture Transaction and compliance with the Government Commitments may also result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses and impacts, and loss of customer and other business relationships. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies, completing the Divestiture Transaction and satisfying all of the Government Commitments include, among others:•the diversion of management attention to integration matters;•difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including intellectual property and communications systems, administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems;•challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the two companies;•differences in control environments, cultures, and auditor expectations may result in future material weaknesses, significant deficiencies, and/or control deficiencies while we work to integrate the companies and align guidelines and practices;•alignment of key performance measurements may result in a greater need to communicate and manage clear expectations while we work to integrate the companies and align guidelines and practices;•difficulties in integrating employees and attracting and retaining key personnel;•challenges in retaining existing customers and obtaining new customers;•difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, accretion targets, business opportunities, financing plans and growth prospects from the combination;•difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;•the impact of the additional debt financing expected to be incurred in connection with the Transactions;•the transition of management to the combined company management team, and the need to address possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;•challenges in managing the divestiture process for the Divestiture Transaction and the ongoing commercial and transition services arrangements to be entered into in connection with the Divestiture Transaction;•known or potential unknown liabilities arising in connection with the Divestiture Transaction that are larger than expected;•an increase in competition from DISH and other third parties that DISH may enter into commercial agreements with, who are significantly larger than we are and enjoy greater resources and scale advantages as compared to us; •difficulties in satisfying the large number of Government Commitments in the required timeframes and cost incurred in the tracking and monitoring of them, including the network build-out obligations under the Government Commitments; •known or potential unknown liabilities of Sprint that are larger than expected; and•other potential adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses or liabilities associated with the Transactions, the Divestiture Transaction and the Government Commitments.Some of these factors are outside of our control and/or will be outside the control of the combined company, and any one of them could result in lower revenues, higher costs and diversion of management time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. In addition, even if the operations of our and Sprint’s businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including, among others, the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected, including as a result of the Divestiture Transaction, the Government Commitments and/or the other actions and conditions we have agreed to in connection with the Transactions, or otherwise. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our and Sprint’s businesses and in connection with the Divestiture Transaction and the Government Commitments, including potential penalties that could arise if we fail to fulfill our obligations thereunder. All of these factors could suppress the earnings per share of the combined company, decrease or delay the projected accretive effect of the Merger, and negatively impact the price of our common stock following the Merger. As a result, it cannot be assured that the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint will result in the realization of the full benefits expected from the Transactions within the anticipated time frames or at all.24Table of ContentsThe indebtedness of the combined company following the completion of the Transactions will be substantially greater than the indebtedness of each of T-Mobile and Sprint on a standalone basis prior to the execution of the Business Combination Agreement. This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect the combined company’s business flexibility and increase its borrowing costs.In connection with the Transactions, we and Sprint have conducted, and expect to conduct, certain pre-Merger financing transactions, which will be used in part to prepay a portion of our and Sprint’s existing indebtedness and to fund liquidity needs. After giving effect to the pre-Merger financing transactions and the Transactions, we anticipate that the combined company will have consolidated indebtedness of up to approximately $69.0 billion to $71.0 billion, based on estimated December 31, 2019 debt and cash balances, and excluding tower obligations and operating lease liabilities.Our substantially increased indebtedness following the Transactions could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business, economic, market and industry conditions and increasing the amount of cash required to meet interest payments. In addition, this increased level of indebtedness following the Transactions may reduce funds available to support efforts to combine our and Sprint’s businesses and realize the expected benefits of the Transactions, and may also reduce funds available for capital expenditures, share repurchases and other activities that may put the combined company at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Further, it may be necessary for the combined company to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in its debt instruments, which could increase the risks associated with the capital structure of the combined company.Because of the substantial indebtedness of the combined company following the completion of the Transactions, there is a risk that the combined company may not be able to service its debt obligations in accordance with their terms.The ability of the combined company to service its substantial debt obligations following the Transactions will depend on future performance, which will be affected by business, economic, market and industry conditions and other factors, including the ability of the combined company to achieve the expected benefits of the Transactions. There is no guarantee that the combined company will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt obligations when due. If the combined company is unable to meet such obligations or fails to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing such debt obligations, it may be required to refinance all or part of its debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices or make additional borrowings. The combined company may not be able to, at any given time, refinance its debt, sell assets or make additional borrowings on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations after the Transactions.Some or all of the combined company’s variable-rate indebtedness may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR will be discontinued after 2021 and will be replaced with an alternative reference rate. The consequence of this development cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness. In addition, any hedging agreements we have and may continue to enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations may not offer complete protection from these risks or may be unsuccessful, and consequently may effectively increase the interest rate we pay on our debt or the exchange rate with respect to such debt, and any portion not subject to such hedging agreements would have full exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations, as applicable. If any financial institutions that are parties to our hedging agreements were to default on their payment obligations to us, declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, we would be unhedged against the underlying exposures. Any posting of collateral by us under our hedging agreements and the modification or termination of any of our hedging agreements could negatively impact our liquidity or other financial metrics. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.The agreements governing the combined company’s indebtedness and other financings will include restrictive covenants that limit the combined company’s operating flexibility.The agreements governing the combined company’s indebtedness and other financings will impose material operating and financial restrictions on the combined company. These restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions and maintenance and incurrence-based financial tests, may limit the combined company’s ability to engage in transactions and pursue strategic business opportunities, including the following:•incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock;•paying dividends, redeeming capital stock or making other restricted payments or investments;•selling or buying assets, properties or licenses;•developing assets, properties or licenses which the combined company has or in the future may procure;25Table of Contents•creating liens on assets securing indebtedness or other obligations;•participating in future FCC auctions of spectrum or private sales of spectrum;•engaging in mergers, acquisitions, business combinations or other transactions;•entering into transactions with affiliates; and•placing restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments.These restrictions could limit the combined company’s ability to obtain debt financing, make share repurchases, refinance or pay principal on its outstanding indebtedness, complete acquisitions for cash or indebtedness or react to business, economic, market and industry conditions and other changes in its operating environment or the economy. Any future indebtedness that the combined company incurs may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the combined company’s debt agreements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these and other agreements, giving the combined company’s lenders the right to terminate any commitments they had made to provide it with further funds and to require the combined company to repay all amounts then outstanding plus any interest, fees, penalties or premiums, and which may include requiring the combined company to sell certain assets securing indebtedness.The financing of the Transactions is not assured.We have received commitments for $27.0 billion in debt financing to fund the Transactions, which is comprised of (i) a $4.0 billion secured revolving credit facility, (ii) a $4.0 billion term loan credit facility and (iii) a $19.0 billion secured bridge loan facility. Furthermore, the Merger financing commitments currently expire on May 1, 2020, and if the completion of the Transactions continues to be delayed, any extension of the financing commitments or new financing commitments may not be obtained on the expected terms or at all. Our reliance on the financing from the $19.0 billion secured bridge loan facility commitment is intended to be reduced through one or more secured note offerings or other long-term financings prior to the Merger closing. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to issue any such secured notes or other long-term financings on terms we find acceptable or at all, especially in light of recent debt market volatility, in which case we may have to exercise some or all of the commitments under the secured bridge facility to fund the Transactions. The obligation of the lenders to provide these debt financing facilities is subject to a number of conditions and the financing of the Transactions may not be obtained on the expected terms or at all. Accordingly, the costs of financing for the Transactions may be higher than expected.Credit rating downgrades could adversely affect the businesses, cash flows, financial condition and operating results of T-Mobile and, following the Transactions, the combined company.Credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings, and, as a result, cost of capital. Our current ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or, following the completion of the Transactions, obligations to the combined company’s obligors. Each rating agency reviews these ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that such ratings will be maintained in the future. A downgrade in the rating of us and/or Sprint could adversely affect the businesses, cash flows, financial condition and operating results of T-Mobile and, following the Transactions, the combined company.We have incurred, and will incur, direct and indirect costs as a result of the Transactions.We have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of completing the Transactions, the Divestiture Transaction and compliance with the Government Commitments, and over a period of time following the completion of the Transactions, the combined company also expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with integrating and coordinating our and Sprint’s businesses, operations, policies and procedures. A portion of the transaction costs related to the Transactions will be incurred regardless of whether the Transactions are completed. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses will exceed the costs historically borne by us. These costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations prior to the Transactions and the financial condition and results of operations of the combined company following the Transactions.Item 1B.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket InformationOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “TMUS.” T-Mobile was added to the S&P 500 Index effective prior to the open of trading on July 15, 2019. We were added to the S&P 500 GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard) Wireless Telecommunication Services Sub-Industry index. As of December 31, 2019, there were 258 registered stockholders of record of our common stock, but we estimate the total number of stockholders to be much higher as a number of our shares are held by brokers or dealers for their customers in street name.27Table of ContentsPerformance GraphThe graph below compares the five-year cumulative total returns of T-Mobile, the S&P 500 index, the NASDAQ Composite index and the Dow Jones US Mobile Telecommunications TSM index.

Comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the standards in effect for those periods. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.(2)On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” and all the related amendments (collectively, the “new revenue standard”), using the modified retrospective method with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application. Comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the standards in effect for those periods. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.(3)In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) was signed into legislation. The TCJA included numerous changes to existing tax law, including a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The rate reduction took place on January 1, 2018. We recognized a net tax benefit of $2.2 billion associated with the enactment of the TCJA in Income tax (expense) benefit in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. (4)On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” (the “new cash flow standard”) which impacted the presentation of our cash flows related to our beneficial interests in securitization transactions, which is the deferred purchase price, resulting in a reclassification of cash inflows from Operating activities to Investing activities of approximately $4.3 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The new cash flow standard also impacted the presentation of our cash payments for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs, resulting in a reclassification of cash outflows from Operating activities to Financing activities of $188 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. There were no cash payments for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. We have applied the new cash flow standard retrospectively to all periods presented. (5)We believe current and future regulatory changes have made the Lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical. We will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the Lifeline program, but have excluded the Lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 4,528,000 reported wholesale customers in 2017.29Table of ContentsItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe objectives of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) are to provide users of our Consolidated Financial Statements with the following:•A narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results;•Context to the financial statements; and•Information that allows assessment of the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.Our MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the three years ended December 31, 2019, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our MD&A are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.Business OverviewUn-carrier StrategyWe are the Un-carrier. Through our Un-carrier strategy, we have disrupted the wireless communications services industry, rattling the status quo, by actively engaging with and listening to our customers and eliminating their existing pain points, including providing them with an unrivaled value, an exceptional experience and implementing signature Un-carrier initiatives that have changed wireless for good.Proposed Sprint TransactionsOn April 29, 2018, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement with Sprint to merge in an all-stock transaction at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile common stock for each share of Sprint common stock, or 9.75 shares of Sprint common stock for each share of T-Mobile common stock. If the Merger closes, the combined company will be named “T-Mobile” and, as a result of the Merger, is expected to be able to build upon our recently launched foundational 5G network 600 MHz spectrum to deliver transformational broad, deep and nationwide 5G for all, accelerate innovation and increase competition in the U.S. wireless, video and broadband industries. Immediately following the Merger, it is anticipated that DT and SoftBank Group Corp. (“SoftBank”) will hold, directly or indirectly, on a fully diluted basis, approximately 41.5% and 27.2%, respectively, of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock, with the remaining approximately 31.3% of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock held by other stockholders, based on closing share prices and certain other assumptions as of December 31, 2019. The consummation of the Merger remains subject to certain closing conditions. We expect the Merger will be permitted to close in early 2020.For more information regarding our Business Combination Agreement, see Note 2 – Business Combinations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.5G LaunchIn December 2019, T-Mobile launched America’s first nationwide 5G network, including prepaid 5G with Metro by T-Mobile, covering more than 200 million people and more than 5,000 cities and towns across the United States with 5G.Magenta PlansIn June 2019, we rebranded our T-Mobile ONE and ONE Plus plans to Magenta and Magenta Plus. TVision HomeIn April 2019, we introduced TVisionTM Home, a rebranded and upgraded version of Layer3 TV. TVisionTM Home delivers what customers want most from high-end home TV, including a premium TV experience and HD and 4K channels. TVisionTM Home launched in eight markets. 30Table of ContentsT-Mobile MONEYIn April 2019, we launched T-Mobile MONEY nationwide, offering customers a no-fee, interest-earning, mobile-first checking account which can be opened and managed from customers’ smartphones. Accounts are held at BankMobile, a Division of Customers Bank, member Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues and we believe our Un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved branded postpaid phone and branded prepaid customer churn.Year Ended December 31,2019 Versus 20182018 Versus 2017(in thousands)201920182017# Change% Change# Change% ChangeNet customer additionsBranded postpaid customers4,515 4,459 3,620 56 1 %839 23 %Branded prepaid customers339 460 855 (121) (26)%(395) (46)%Total branded customers4,854 4,919 4,475 (65) (1)%444 10 %Year Ended December 31,Bps Change 2019 Versus 2018Bps Change 2018 Versus 2017201920182017Branded postpaid phone churn0.89 %1.01 %1.18 %-12 bps-17 bpsBranded prepaid churn3.82 %3.96 %4.04 %-14 bps-8 bpsAccounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Current YearLeasesOn January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease standard.

See Note 18 – Guarantor Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.37Table of ContentsPerformance MeasuresIn managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures. These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry on key operating and financial measures.Total CustomersA customer is generally defined as a SIM number with a unique T-Mobile identifier which is associated with an account that generates revenue. Branded customers generally include customers that are qualified either for postpaid service utilizing phones, wearables, DIGITS or other connected devices which includes tablets and SyncUp DRIVE™, where they generally pay after receiving service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance. Our branded prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile. Wholesale customers include M2M and MVNO customers that operate on our network but are managed by wholesale partners. Starting with the three months ended March 31, 2020, we plan to discontinue reporting wholesale customers and instead focus on branded customers and wholesale revenues, which we consider more relevant than the number of wholesale customers given the expansion of M2M and IoT products.On July 18, 2019, we entered into an agreement whereby certain T-Mobile branded prepaid products will now be offered and distributed by a current MVNO partner. Upon the effective date, the agreement resulted in a base adjustment to reduce branded prepaid customers by 616,000, as we no longer actively support the branded product offering. Prospectively, new customer activity associated with these products is recorded within wholesale customers and revenue for these customers is recorded within Wholesale revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.The following table sets forth the number of ending customers:As of December 31,2019 Versus 20182018 Versus 2017(in thousands)201920182017# Change% Change# Change% ChangeCustomers, end of periodBranded postpaid phone customers40,345 37,224 34,114 3,121 8 %3,110 9 %Branded postpaid other customers6,689 5,295 3,933 1,394 26 %1,362 35 %Total branded postpaid customers47,034 42,519 38,047 4,515 11 %4,472 12 %Branded prepaid customers (1)20,860 21,137 20,668 (277) (1)%469 2 %Total branded customers67,894 63,656 58,715 4,238 7 %4,941 8 %Wholesale customers (1)18,152 15,995 13,870 2,157 13 %2,125 15 %Total customers, end of period86,046 79,651 72,585 6,395 8 %7,066 10 %Adjustment to branded prepaid customers (1)(616) — — (616) NM— — %(1) On July 18, 2019, we entered into an agreement whereby certain T-Mobile branded prepaid products will now be offered and distributed by a current MVNO partner.

An account may include branded postpaid phone customers and branded postpaid other customers which includes wearables, DIGITS, and other connected devices such as tablets and SyncUp DRIVE™. We believe branded postpaid customers per account provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate our branded postpaid customer base.The following table sets forth the branded postpaid customers per account:As of December 31, 2019 Versus 20182018 Versus 2017201920182017# Change% Change# Change% ChangeBranded postpaid customers per account3.13 3.03 2.93 0.10 3 %0.10 3 %Branded postpaid customers per account increased 3% primarily from continued growth of new customer segments and rate plans such as Unlimited 55+, Military, Business and Essentials, promotional activities targeting families and the continued success of other connected devices and wearables, specifically tablets and the Apple Watch.39Table of ContentsStarting with the three months ended March 31, 2020, we plan to report Average Revenue per Postpaid Account or Postpaid ARPA, in addition to our existing ARPU metrics, reflecting the increasing importance of non-phone devices to our customers. We also plan to discontinue reporting branded postpaid customers per account.ChurnChurn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period. The number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored within a certain period of time. We believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.The following table sets forth the churn: Year Ended December 31,Bps Change 2019 Versus 2018Bps Change 2018 Versus 2017201920182017Branded postpaid phone churn0.89 %1.01 %1.18 %-12 bps-17 bpsBranded prepaid churn3.82 %3.96 %4.04 %-14 bps-8 bpsBranded postpaid phone churn decreased 12 basis points, primarily from increased customer satisfaction and loyalty from ongoing improvements to network quality, industry-leading customer service and the overall value of our offerings. Branded prepaid churn decreased 14 basis points, primarily from increased customer satisfaction and loyalty from ongoing improvements to network quality and the continued success of our prepaid brands due to promotional activities and rate plan offers.Average Revenue Per UserARPU represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base.

Net income margin represents Net income divided by Service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues.Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications services companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, network decommissioning costs and costs related to the Transactions, as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, as well as certain other nonrecurring income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).41Table of ContentsThe following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:Year Ended December 31,2019 Versus 20182018 Versus 2017(in millions)201920182017$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeNet income$3,468 $2,888 $4,536 $580 20 %$(1,648) (36)%Adjustments:Interest expense727 835 1,111 (108) (13)%(276) (25)%Interest expense to affiliates408 522 560 (114) (22)%(38) (7)%Interest income(24) (19) (17) (5) 26 %(2) 12 %Other expense, net8 54 73 (46) (85)%(19) (26)%Income tax expense (benefit)1,135 1,029 (1,375) 106 10 %2,404 (175)%Operating income5,722 5,309 4,888 413 8 %421 9 %Depreciation and amortization6,616 6,486 5,984 130 2 %502 8 %Stock-based compensation (1)423 389 307 34 9 %82 27 %Merger-related costs620 196 — 424 216 %196 NM Other, net (2)2 18 34 (16) (89)%(16) (47)%Adjusted EBITDA$13,383 $12,398 $11,213 $985 8 %$1,185 11 %Net income margin (Net income divided by service revenues)10 %9 %15 %100 bps-600 bpsAdjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by service revenues)39 %39 %37 %— bps200 bps(1)Stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree to stock-based compensation expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, certain stock-based compensation expenses associated with the Transactions have been included in Merger-related costs. (2)Other, net may not agree to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income primarily due to certain non-routine operating activities, such as other special items that would not be expected to reoccur or are not reflective of T-Mobile’s ongoing operating performance, and are therefore excluded in Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased $985 million, or 8%, primarily due to:•Higher service revenues, as further discussed above; and•The positive impact of the new lease standard of approximately $195 million; partially offset by•Higher Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding Merger-related costs; •Higher Cost of services expenses; and•The impact from hurricane-related reimbursements, net of costs, of $158 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no significant impacts from hurricanes for the year ended December 31, 2019.•The impact from commission costs capitalized and amortized beginning upon the adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, reduced Adjusted EBITDA by $337 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to year ended December 31, 2018.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and common stock, financing leases, the sale of certain receivables, financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms and secured and unsecured revolving credit facilities with DT. Upon consummation of the Transactions, we will incur substantial third-party indebtedness which will increase our future financial commitments, including aggregate interest payments on higher total indebtedness, and may adversely impact our liquidity. Further, the incurrence of additional indebtedness may inhibit our ability to incur new debt under the terms governing our existing and future indebtedness, which may make it more difficult for us to incur new debt in the future to finance our business strategy.42Table of ContentsCash FlowsThe following is a condensed schedule of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:Year Ended December 31,2019 Versus 20182018 Versus 2017(in millions)201920182017$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeNet cash provided by operating activities$6,824 $3,899 $3,831 $2,925 75 %$68 2 %Net cash used in investing activities(4,125) (579) (6,745) (3,546) 612 %6,166 (91)%Net cash used in financing activities(2,374) (3,336) (1,367) 962 (29)%(1,969) 144 %Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities increased $2.9 billion, or 75%, from:•A $2.0 billion decrease in net cash outflows from changes in working capital, primarily due to lower use from Accounts receivable, Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Equipment installment plan receivables, partially offset by higher use from Inventories; and •A $951 million increase in Net income and net non-cash adjustments to Net income.With the adoption of the new lease standard, changes in Operating lease right-of-use assets and Short and long-term operating lease liabilities are now presented in Changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net impact of changes in these accounts decreased Net cash provided by operating activities by $235 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities increased $3.5 billion, or 612%. The use of cash for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily from: •$6.4 billion in Purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, primarily driven by growth in network build as we continued deployment of low band spectrum, including 600 MHz, and launched our nationwide 5G network;•$967 million in Purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits; and•$632 million in Net cash related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements, see Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information; partially offset by•$3.9 billion in Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities decreased $1.0 billion, or 29%. The use of cash for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily from:•$798 million for Repayments of financing lease obligations; •$775 million for Repayments of short-term debt for purchases of inventory, property and equipment; •$600 million for Repayments of long-term debt; and•$156 million for Tax withholdings on share-based awards.•Activity under the revolving credit facility included borrowing and full repayment of $2.3 billion, for a net of $0 impact.Cash and Cash EquivalentsAs of December 31, 2019, our Cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2018.Free Cash FlowFree Cash Flow represents Net cash provided by operating activities less payments for Purchases of property and equipment, including Proceeds from sales of tower sites and Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions, less Cash 43Table of Contentspayments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management, investors and analysts of our financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business.In 2019, we sold tower sites for proceeds of $38 million which are included in Proceeds from sales of tower sites within Net cash used in investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As these proceeds were from the sale of fixed assets and are used by management to assess cash available for capital expenditures during the year, we determined the proceeds are relevant for the calculation of Free Cash Flow and included them in the table below. Other proceeds from the sale of fixed assets for the periods presented are not significant. We have presented the impact of the sales in the table below, which illustrates the calculation of Free Cash Flow and reconciles Free Cash Flow to Net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.Year Ended December 31,2019 Versus 20182018 Versus 2017(in millions)201920182017$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeNet cash provided by operating activities$6,824 $3,899 $3,831 $2,925 75 %$68 2 %Cash purchases of property and equipment(6,391) (5,541) (5,237) (850) 15 %(304) 6 %Proceeds from sales of tower sites38 — — 38 NM — NM Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions3,876 5,406 4,319 (1,530) (28)%1,087 25 %Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs(28) (212) (188) 184 (87)%(24) 13 %Free Cash Flow$4,319 $3,552 $2,725 $767 22 %$827 30 %Free Cash Flow increased $767 million, or 22%, primarily from:•Higher Net cash provided by operating activities, as described above; and•Lower Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; partially offset by•Lower Proceeds related to our deferred purchase price from securitization transactions; and•Higher Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of $473 million and $362 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.•Free Cash Flow includes $442 million and $86 million in payments for Merger-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Borrowing Capacity and Debt FinancingAs of December 31, 2019, our total debt and financing lease liabilities were $27.3 billion, excluding our tower obligations, of which $24.9 billion was classified as long-term debt.Effective April 28, 2019, we redeemed $600 million aggregate principal amount of our DT Senior Reset Notes. The notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 104.666% of the principal amount of the notes (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon) and were paid on April 29, 2019. The redemption premium was $28 million and was included in Other expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and in Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Certain components of the reset features were required to be bifurcated from the DT Senior Reset Notes and were separately accounted for as embedded derivatives. The write-off of embedded derivatives upon redemption resulted in a gain of $11 million, which was included in Other expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. See Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.We maintain a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with DT which is comprised of a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement and a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit agreement. In December 2019, we amended the terms of the revolving credit facility with DT to extend the maturity date to December 29, 2022. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. We maintain a financing arrangement with Deutsche Bank AG, which allows for up to $108 million in borrowings. Under the financing arrangement, we can effectively extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain vendors. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no outstanding balances.44Table of ContentsWe maintain vendor financing arrangements with our primary network equipment suppliers. Under the respective agreements, we can obtain extended financing terms. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we utilized $800 million and repaid $775 million under the vendor financing arrangements. Invoices subject to extended payment terms have various due dates through the first quarter of 2020. Payments on vendor financing agreements are included in Repayments of short-term debt for purchases of inventory, property and equipment, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2019, there were $25 million in outstanding borrowings under the vendor financing agreements which were included in Short-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2018, there was no outstanding balance.Consents on DebtOn May 18, 2018, under the terms and conditions described in the Consent Solicitation Statement dated as of May 14, 2018, we obtained consents necessary to effect certain amendments to certain of our existing debt and certain existing debt of our subsidiaries. If the Merger is consummated, we will make payments for requisite consents to third-party note holders. There was no payment accrued as of December 31, 2019.In connection with the entry into the Business Combination Agreement, DT and T-Mobile USA entered into a financing matters agreement, dated as of April 29, 2018, pursuant to which DT agreed, among other things, to consent to the incurrence by T-Mobile USA of secured debt in connection with and after the consummation of the Merger. If the Merger is consummated, we will make payments for requisite consents to DT. There was no payment accrued as of December 31, 2019. See Note 8 - Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Commitment LetterIn connection with the entry into the Business Combination Agreement, T-Mobile USA entered into a commitment letter, dated as of April 29, 2018 (as amended and restated on May 15, 2018 and on September 6, 2019, the “Commitment Letter”). In connection with the financing provided for in the Commitment Letter, we expect to incur certain fees payable to the financial institutions, including certain financing fees on the secured term loan commitment. If the Merger closes, we will incur additional fees for the financial institutions structuring and providing the commitments and certain take-out fees associated with the issuance of permanent secured bond debt in lieu of the secured bridge loan. In total, we may incur up to approximately $340 million in fees associated with the Commitment Letter. We began incurring certain Commitment Letter fees on November 1, 2019, which were recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. There were $12 million of fees accrued as of December 31, 2019. See Note 8 - Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Future Sources and Uses of LiquidityWe may seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2020, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other assets in private party transactions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. Excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions, or for other assets, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months as well as our longer-term liquidity needs. Our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of high yield callable debt and stock purchases.In October 2018, we entered into interest rate lock derivatives with notional amounts of $9.6 billion. The fair value of interest rate lock derivatives was a liability of $1.2 billion and $447 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and was included in Other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.In November 2019, we extended the mandatory termination date on our interest rate lock derivatives to June 3, 2020. In December 2019, we made net collateral transfers to certain of our derivative counterparties totaling $632 million, which included variation margin transfers to (or from) such derivative counterparties based on daily market movements. These collateral transfers are included in Other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and in Net cash related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements within Net cash used in investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The interest rate lock derivatives will be settled upon the earlier of the issuance of fixed-rate debt or the current mandatory termination date. Upon settlement of the interest rate lock derivatives, we will receive, or make, a cash payment in the amount of the fair value of the cash flow hedge as of the settlement date. We expect our existing sources of liquidity to be sufficient to meet the requirements of the interest rate lock derivatives.45Table of ContentsWe determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.The indentures and credit facilities governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to incur more debt, pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock, make certain investments, repurchase stock, create liens or other encumbrances, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the Issuer to loan funds or make payments to the Parent. However, the Issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the Parent under the terms of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of December 31, 2019.Financing Lease FacilitiesWe have entered into uncommitted financing lease facilities with certain partners, which provide us with the ability to enter into financing leases for network equipment and services. As of December 31, 2019, we have committed to $3.9 billion of financing leases under these financing lease facilities, of which $898 million was executed during the year ended December 31, 2019. Capital ExpendituresOur liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure. Property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to our network transformation, including the build-out of our network to utilize our 600 MHz spectrum licenses and the deployment of 5G. We expect cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of approximately $400 million, to be $5.9 to $6.2 billion and cash purchases of property and equipment, excluding capitalized interest, to be $5.5 to $5.8 billion in 2020. This includes expenditures for 600 MHz and 5G deployment. This does not include property and equipment obtained through financing lease agreements, vendor financing agreements, leased wireless devices transferred from inventory or any additional purchases of spectrum licenses.Share RepurchasesOn December 6, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of our common stock through December 31, 2018 (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”). Repurchased shares are retired. The 2017 Stock Repurchase Program was completed on April 29, 2018.On April 27, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the total stock repurchase program to $9.0 billion, consisting of the $1.5 billion in repurchases previously completed and up to an additional $7.5 billion of repurchases of our common stock through the year ending December 31, 2020 (the ""2018 Stock Repurchase Program""). The additional $7.5 billion repurchase authorization is contingent upon the termination of the Business Combination Agreement and the abandonment of the Transactions contemplated under the Business Combination Agreement. There were no repurchases of our common stock under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program in 2019 or 2018. See Note 12 - Repurchases of Common Stock of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. DividendsWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our credit facilities and the indentures and supplemental indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding financing leases, contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. 46Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of December 31, 2019 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods:(in millions)Less Than 1 Year1 - 3 Years4 - 5 YearsMore Than 5 YearsTotalLong-term debt (1)$— $5,500 $7,300 $12,200 $25,000 Interest on long-term debt1,282 2,365 1,796 1,163 6,606 Financing lease liabilities, including imputed interest1,013 1,147 172 115 2,447 Tower obligations (2)160 321 320 467 1,268 Operating lease liabilities, including imputed interest2,754 4,894 3,523 3,797 14,968 Purchase obligations (3)3,603 3,263 1,597 1,387 9,850 Total contractual obligations$8,812 $17,490 $14,708 $19,129 $60,139 (1)Represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment, financing lease obligations and vendor financing arrangements. See Note 8 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.(2)Future minimum payments, including principal and interest payments and imputed lease rental income, related to the tower obligations. See Note 9 – Tower Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.(3)The minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contracts. Termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due as of the earliest we could exit the contract, typically in less than one year. For certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. This table does not include open purchase orders as of December 31, 2019 under normal business purposes. See Note 16 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. Other long-term liabilities have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor of such payments. See Note 17 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.The purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase and lease spectrum licenses, wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we are contractually committed. Where we are committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether we take delivery, we have included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. The acquisition of spectrum licenses is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.In October 2018, we entered into interest rate lock derivatives with notional amounts of $9.6 billion. The fair value of interest rate lock derivatives was a liability of $1.2 billion and $447 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and was included in Other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Balances related to the cash flow hedges have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of settlements. See Note 7 – Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Related Party TransactionsWe have related party transactions associated with DT or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany servicing and licensing. See Note 17 - Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Disclosure of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.47Table of ContentsAs of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2019, that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with DT. We have relied upon DT for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: MTN Irancell, Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2019, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, provided basic telecommunications services to three customers in Germany identified on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List maintained by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control: Bank Melli, Bank Sepah, and Europäisch-Iranische Handelsbank. These services have been terminated or are in the process of being terminated. For the year ended December 31, 2019, gross revenues of all DT affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic and telecommunications services with the Iranian parties identified herein were less than $0.1 million, and the estimated net profits were less than $0.1 million.In addition, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate a fixed-line network in their respective European home countries (in particular Germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the Embassy of Iran in those European countries. Gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were less than $0.1 million. We understand that DT intends to continue these activities.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have arrangements, as amended from time to time, to sell certain EIP accounts receivable and service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as a source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2019, we derecognized net receivables of $2.6 billion upon sale through these arrangements. See Note 4 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition as they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Eight of these policies, discussed below, are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies.LeasesWe adopted the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 and recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases that have not previously been recorded. Significant Judgments:The most significant judgments and impacts upon adoption of the standard include the following:•In evaluating contracts to determine if they qualify as a lease, we consider factors such as if we have obtained or transferred substantially all of the rights to the underlying asset through exclusivity, if we can or if we have transferred the ability to direct the use of the asset by making decisions about how and for what purpose the asset will be used and if the lessor has substantive substitution rights. Identification of a lease may require significant judgment. •We recognized right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities for operating leases that have not previously been recorded. The lease liability for operating leases is based on the net present value of future minimum lease payments. The right-of-use asset for operating leases is based on the lease liability adjusted for the reclassification of certain balance sheet amounts such as prepaid rent and deferred rent which we remeasured at adoption due to the application of hindsight to our lease term estimates. Deferred and prepaid rent will no longer be presented separately.48Table of Contents•Capital lease assets previously included within Property and equipment, net were reclassified to financing lease right-of-use assets, and capital lease liabilities previously included in Short-term debt and Long-term debt were reclassified to financing lease liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.•Certain line items in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the “Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information” have been renamed to align with the new terminology presented in the new lease standard; “Repayment of capital lease obligations” is now presented as “Repayments of financing lease obligations” and “Assets acquired under capital lease obligations” is now presented as “Financing lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations.” In the “Operating Activities” section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows we have added “Operating lease right-of-use assets” and “Short and long-term operating lease liabilities” which represent the change in the operating lease asset and liability, respectively. Additionally, in the “Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information” section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows we have added “Operating lease payments,” and in the “Noncash investing and financing activities” section we have added “Operating lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations.” •In determining the discount rate used to measure the right-of-use asset and lease liability, we use rates implicit in the lease, or if not readily available, we use our incremental borrowing rate. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on an estimated secured rate comprised of a risk-free LIBOR rate plus a credit spread as secured by our assets. Determining a credit spread as secured by our assets may require significant judgment.•Certain of our lease agreements include rental payments based on changes in the consumer price index (“CPI”). Lease liabilities are not remeasured as a result of changes in the CPI; instead, changes in the CPI are treated as variable lease payments and are excluded from the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. These payments are recognized in the period in which the related obligation was incurred. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. •We elected the use of hindsight whereby we applied current lease term assumptions that are applied to new leases in determining the expected lease term period for all cell sites. Upon adoption of the new lease standard and application of hindsight our expected lease term has shortened to reflect payments due for the initial non-cancelable lease term only. This assessment corresponds to our lease term assessment for new leases and aligns with the payments that have been disclosed as lease commitments in prior years. As a result, the average remaining lease term for cell sites has decreased from approximately nine to five years based on lease contracts in effect at transition on January 1, 2019. The aggregate impact of using hindsight is an estimated decrease in Total operating expenses of $240 million in fiscal year 2019.•We were also required to reassess the previously failed sale-leasebacks of certain T-Mobile-owned wireless communications tower sites and determine whether the transfer of the assets to the tower operator under the arrangement met the transfer of control criteria in the revenue standard and whether a sale should be recognized. Determining whether the transfer of control criteria has been met requires significant judgement.•We concluded that a sale has not occurred for the 6,200 tower sites transferred to Crown Castle International Corp. (“CCI”) pursuant to a master prepaid lease arrangement; therefore, these sites will continue to be accounted for as failed sale-leasebacks.•We concluded that a sale should be recognized for the 900 tower sites transferred to CCI pursuant to the sale of a subsidiary and for the 500 tower sites transferred to Phoenix Tower International (“PTI”). Upon adoption on January 1, 2019, we derecognized our existing long-term financial obligation and the tower-related property and equipment associated with these 1,400 previously failed sale-leaseback tower sites and recognized a lease liability and right-of-use asset for the leaseback of the tower sites. The impacts from the change in accounting conclusion are primarily a decrease in Other revenues of $44 million and a decrease in Interest expense of $34 million in fiscal year 2019.•Rental revenues and expenses associated with co-location tower sites are presented on a net basis under the new lease standard. These revenues and expenses were presented on a gross basis under the former lease standard. 49Table of ContentsLease ExpenseWe have operating leases for cell sites, retail locations, corporate offices and dedicated transportation lines, some of which have escalating rentals during the initial lease term and during subsequent optional renewal periods. We recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for operating leases based on the net present value of future minimum lease payments. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term and renewal periods that are considered reasonably certain. We consider several factors in assessing whether renewal periods are reasonably certain of being exercised, including the continued maturation of our network nationwide, technological advances within the telecommunications industry and the availability of alternative sites. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15 - Leases of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Revenue RecognitionWe primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless services to customers and selling or leasing devices and accessories. Our contracts with customers may involve multiple performance obligations, which include wireless services, wireless devices or a combination thereof, and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.Significant JudgmentsThe most significant judgments affecting the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with our customers include the following items:•Revenue for service contracts that we assess are not probable of collection is not recognized until the contract is completed or terminated and cash is received. Collectibility is re-assessed when there is a significant change in facts or circumstances. Our assessment of collectibility considers whether we may limit our exposure to credit risk through our right to stop transferring additional service in the event the customer is delinquent as well as certain contract terms such as down payments that reduce our exposure to credit risk. Customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain. See “Allowances,” below, for more discussion on how we assess credit risk.•Promotional EIP bill credits offered to a customer on an equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining a service contract may result in an extended service contract based on whether a substantive penalty is deemed to exist. Determining whether contingent EIP bill credits result in a substantive termination penalty may require significant judgment.•The identification of distinct performance obligations within our service plans may require significant judgment.•Revenue is recorded net of costs paid to another party for performance obligations where we arrange for the other party to transfer goods or services to the customer (i.e., when we are acting as an agent). For example, performance obligations relating to services provided by third-party content providers where we neither control a right to the content provider’s service nor control the underlying service itself are presented net because we are acting as an agent. The determination of whether we control the underlying service or right to the service prior to our transfer to the customer requires, at times, significant judgment.•For transactions where we recognize a significant financing component, judgment is required to determine the discount rate. For EIP sales, the discount rate used to adjust the transaction price primarily reflects current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk of the customer. Customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain. See “Allowances”, below, for more discussion on how we assess credit risk.•Our products are generally sold with a right of return, which is accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Device return levels are estimated based on the expected value method as there are a large number of contracts with similar characteristics and the outcome of each contract is independent of the others. Historical return rate experience is a significant input to our expected value methodology.50Table of Contents•Sales of equipment to indirect dealers who have been identified as our customer (referred to as the sell-in model) often include credits subsequently paid to the dealer as a reimbursement for any discount promotions offered to the end consumer. These credits (payments to a customer) are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize from the sales of equipment to indirect dealers and are estimated based on historical experience and other factors, such as expected promotional activity.•The determination of the standalone selling price for contracts that involve more than one performance obligation may require significant judgment, such as when the selling price of a good or service is not readily observable.•For capitalized contract costs, determining the amortization period over which such costs are recognized as well as assessing the indicators of impairment may require significant judgment.See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 10 - Revenue From Contracts with Customers of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.AllowancesWe maintain an allowance for credit losses, which is management’s estimate of such losses inherent in our receivables portfolio, comprised of accounts receivable and EIP receivable segments. Changes in the allowance for credit losses and, therefore, in related provision for credit losses (“bad debt expense”) can materially affect earnings. Credit risk characteristics are assessed for each receivable segment. In applying the judgment and review required to determine the allowance for credit losses, management considers a number of factors, including receivable volumes, receivable delinquency status, historical loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as macro-economic conditions. While our methodology attributes portions of the allowance to specific portfolio segments, the entire allowance for credit losses is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total receivables portfolio.Management also considers an amount that represents management’s judgment of risks inherent in the process and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses, including process risk and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments.To the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends or assumptions, the appropriate allowance levels for realized credit losses could differ from the estimate. We write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on factors such as customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date.We offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments over a period of up to 36 months using an EIP. EIP receivables not held for sale are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, allowance for credit losses and unamortized discounts. Receivables held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. At the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest if the EIP term exceeds 12 months as there is no stated rate of interest on the EIP receivables. The EIP receivables are recorded at their present value, which is determined by discounting future cash payments at the imputed interest rate. The difference between the recorded amount of the EIP receivables and their unpaid principal balance (i.e., the contractual amount due from the customer) results in a discount which is allocated to the performance obligations of the arrangement and recorded as a reduction in transaction price. We determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk on the EIP receivables. As a result, we do not recognize a separate credit loss allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows resulting from credit risk are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable. The imputed discount on EIP receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as Other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.Subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we assess the need for and, if necessary, recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated probable losses on the gross EIP receivable balances exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances. Deferred Purchase Price AssetsIn connection with the sales of certain service and EIP accounts receivable pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable Level 3 inputs, including customer default rates and credit worthiness, dilutions and recoveries. See Note 4 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.51Table of ContentsDepreciationDepreciation commences once assets have been placed in service. We generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit. Leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to us, which is generally shorter than the lease term and considers expected losses. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. These studies consider actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate that the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book values are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 – Property and Equipment of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management’s underlying estimates of useful lives.Evaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for ImpairmentWe assess the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, for potential impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired.We have identified two reporting units for which discrete financial information is available and results are regularly reviewed by management: wireless and Layer3. The Layer3 reporting unit consists of the assets and liabilities of Layer3 TV, Inc., which was acquired in January 2018. The wireless reporting unit consists of the remaining assets and liabilities of T-Mobile US, Inc., excluding Layer3 TV, Inc. We separately evaluate these reporting units for impairment. When assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.We employed a qualitative approach to assess the wireless reporting unit. The fair value of the wireless reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. We recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. In the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. We believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value.We employed a quantitative approach to assess the Layer3 reporting unit. The fair value of the Layer3 reporting unit is determined using an income approach, which is based on estimated discounted future cash flows. We made estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates to determine the reporting unit’s estimated fair value. The key assumptions used were as follows:•Expected cash flows underlying the Layer3 business plan for the periods 2020 through 2024, which took into account estimates of subscribers for TVision services, average revenue and content cost per subscriber, operating costs and capital expenditures. •Cash flows beyond 2024 were projected to grow at a long-term growth rate estimated at 3%. Estimating a long-term growth rate requires significant judgment about future business strategies as well as micro- and macro-economic environments that are inherently uncertain.•We used a discount rate of 32% to risk adjust the cash flow projections in determining the estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the Layer3 reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 3% as of December 31, 2019. Delays in the national launch of TVision services or cash flows that do not meet our projections could result in a goodwill impairment of Layer3 in the future. The carrying value of the goodwill associated with the Layer3 reporting unit was $218 million as of December 31, 2019.52Table of ContentsWe test our spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with our management of the overall business at a national level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. If the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. We estimate fair value using the Greenfield methodology, which is an income approach, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The Greenfield methodology values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses). The value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. We base the assumptions underlying the Greenfield methodology on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. Future cash flows in the Greenfield methodology are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, EBITDA margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.The valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. If actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. The most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures and the long-term growth rate. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our annual impairment test and impairment charges.Income TaxesDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available.We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedSee Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to economic risks in the normal course of business, primarily from changes in interest rates, including changes in investment yields and changes in spreads due to credit risk and other factors. These risks, along with other business risks, impact our cost of capital. Our policy is to manage exposure related to fluctuations in interest rates in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term. We have established interest rate risk limits that are closely monitored by measuring interest rate sensitivities of our debt portfolio. We do not foresee significant changes in the strategies used to manage market risk in the near future.We are exposed to changes in interest rates on our Incremental Term Loan Facility with DT, our majority stockholder. See Note 8 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.To perform the sensitivity analysis, we selected hypothetical changes in market rates that are expected to reflect reasonably possible near-term changes in those rates. We assessed the risk of a change in the fair value from the effect of a hypothetical interest rate change for 30-day LIBOR rates of positive 150 and negative 50 basis points. In cases where the debt is redeemable and the fair value calculation results in a liability greater than the cost to replace the debt, the maximum liability is assumed to 53Table of Contentsbe no greater than the current cost to redeem the debt. As of December 31, 2019, the change in the fair value of our Incremental Term Loan Facility, based on this hypothetical change, is shown in the table below:Carrying AmountFair ValueFair Value Assuming(in millions)+150 Basis Point Shift-50 Basis Point ShiftLIBOR plus 1.50% Senior Secured Term Loan due 2022$2,000 $2,000 $1,966 $2,000 LIBOR plus 1.75% Senior Secured Term Loan due 20242,000 2,000 1,956 2,000 We are exposed to changes in the benchmark interest rate associated with our interest rate lock derivatives.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Sprint Merger and Note 2 - Business Combination of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our 4G Long-Term Evolution (“LTE”) network covers 328 million people (99% of the U.S. population). Additionally, our 5G network is America’s largest, covering 1.6 million square miles, 280 million people and 9,100 cities and towns across the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as of December 31, 2020.We continue to expand the footprint and improve the quality of our network, providing outstanding wireless experiences for customers who will not have to compromise on quality and value. Going forward, it is this network that will allow us to deliver new, innovative products and services with the same customer experience focus and industry-disrupting mentality that has redefined the wireless communications services industry in the United States in the customers’ favor. BusinessAs of December 31, 2020, we provide wireless services to 102.1 million postpaid and prepaid customers and generate revenue by providing affordable wireless communications services to these customers, as well as a wide selection of wireless devices and accessories. Our most significant expenses relate to operating and expanding our network, providing a full range of devices, acquiring and retaining high-quality customers and compensating employees. We provide service, devices and accessories across our flagship brands, T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile, through our owned and operated retail stores, as well as through our websites (www.t-mobile.com and www.metrobyt-mobile.com), T-Mobile app and customer care channels. In addition, we sell devices to dealers and other third-party distributors for resale through independent third-party retail outlets and a variety of third-party websites. The information on our websites is not part of this Form 10-K. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information.Services and ProductsWe provide wireless communications services through a variety of service plan options. We also offer a wide selection of wireless devices, including smartphones, wearables, tablets and other mobile communication devices, which are manufactured by various suppliers. 5Table of ContentsOur primary service plan offering, which allows customers to subscribe for wireless communications services separately from the purchase of a device, is our signature Magenta plan (“Magenta”), which includes, among other benefits, unlimited talk, text and smartphone data on our network, 5G access at no extra cost, scam protection features and more. Customers also have the ability to choose additional features, such as HD video streaming and increased high-speed hotspot data, for an additional cost on our Magenta Plus plan. We also offer an Essentials rate plan for customers who want the basics, as well as specific rate plans to qualifying customers, including Unlimited 55+, Military, First Responder, and Business. Our device options for qualifying customers include: •The option of financing all or a portion of the individual device or accessory purchase price at the time of sale over an installment period, generally of 24 months, using an Equipment Installment Plan (“EIP”);•For qualifying customers who finance their initial device with an EIP, an option to enroll in our Just Upgrade My Phone (“JUMP!®”) program to later upgrade their device; and•The option to lease a device over a period of up to 18 months and upgrade it when eligibility requirements are met.We also provide products that are complementary to our wireless communications services, including device protection, Home Internet, TVision™ and wireline communication services to domestic and international customers.In August 2020, we unified the Sprint retail operations under the T-Mobile brand, providing Sprint customers access to all of our products, services and retail locations. CustomersWe provide wireless communications services to two primary categories of customers: •Postpaid customers generally include customers who are qualified to pay after receiving wireless communications services utilizing phones, wearables, DIGITS (a service that allows our customers to use multiple mobile numbers on any compatible smartphone or device with internet connection) or other connected devices, which include tablets and SyncUp products; and•Prepaid customers generally include customers who pay for wireless communications services in advance. Our prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile.We provide Machine-to-Machine (“M2M”) and Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) customers access to our network. This access and the customer relationship is managed by wholesale partners. We generate the majority of our service revenues by providing wireless communications services to postpaid and prepaid customers. Our ability to attract and retain postpaid and prepaid customers is important to our business in the generation of service revenues, equipment revenues and other revenues. In 2020, our service revenues generated by providing wireless communications services by customer category were:•72% Postpaid customers;•19% Prepaid customers; and •9% Wholesale, roaming and other services.Substantially all of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were earned in the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Network StrategyOn April 1, 2020, we closed our Merger with Sprint, which greatly enhanced our spectrum position. Integration of the spectrum and network assets acquired in the Merger is expected to occur over the next three years.The integration strategy includes deploying the acquired spectrum on the combined network assets to supplement capacity, migrating Sprint customers to our network and optimizing the combined assets by decommissioning redundant sites to realize synergies.6Table of ContentsSpectrum PositionWe provide wireless communications services utilizing mid-band spectrum licenses, such as AWS, PCS and 2.5 GHz, low-band spectrum licenses utilizing our 600 MHz, 700 MHz and 800 MHz spectrum and mmWave spectrum.•We controlled an average of 329 MHz of combined low- and mid-band spectrum nationwide as of December 31, 2020. This spectrum is comprised of:•An average of 40 MHz in the 600 MHz band;•An average of 10 MHz in the 700 MHz band;•An average of 14 MHz in the 800 MHz band;•An average of 66 MHz in the 1900 MHz PCS band;•An average of 41 MHz in the AWS band; and•An average of 158 MHz in the 2.5 GHz band.•In March 2020, the FCC announced the results of Auctions 103 (37/39 GHz and 47 GHz spectrum bands). We were the winning bidder of 2,384 licenses for an aggregate price of $873 million. Prior to the Merger, the FCC announced that Sprint was the winning bidder of 127 licenses in Auction 103.•In April 2020, we acquired control of FCC licenses in the 800 MHz, 1900 MHz and 2.5 GHz bands as part of our Merger with Sprint. •We plan to evaluate future spectrum purchases in current and upcoming auctions and in the secondary market to further augment our current spectrum position.•As of December 31, 2020, we had equipment deployed on approximately 108,000 macro cell sites and 69,000 small cell/distributed antenna system sites across our T-Mobile and legacy Sprint networks. 5G Leadership•As of December 31, 2020, our Extended Range 5G covers 280 million people in 9,100 cities and towns covering 1.6 million square miles.•Our Ultra Capacity 5G covers 106 million people as of December 31, 2020.CompetitionThe wireless communications services industry is highly competitive. We are the second largest provider of wireless communications services in the U.S. as measured by our total postpaid and prepaid customers. Our competitors include other national carriers, such as AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”) and Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”). In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller regional carriers, MVNOs, including TracFone Wireless, Inc., Comcast Corporation, Charter Communications, Inc., Altice USA, Inc. and DISH, many of which offer no-contract, postpaid and prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice, messaging and data services, using alternative technologies or services. Competitive factors within the wireless communications services industry include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies and regulatory changes. Some competitors have shown a willingness to use aggressive pricing as a source of differentiation. Other competitors have sought to add ancillary services, like mobile video or music streaming services, to enhance their offerings. Taken together, the competitive factors we face continue to put pressure on growth and margins as companies compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customers.Human CapitalEmployeesAs of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 75,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions.7Table of ContentsAttraction and RetentionWe employ a highly skilled workforce within a broad range of functions. Our employees are located throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico, to serve our nationwide network and retail operations. Our headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington and Overland Park, Kansas.We attract and retain our workforce through a dynamic and inclusive culture and by providing exceptional benefits, including:•Competitive medical, dental and vision benefits;•Annual stock grants to all full-time and part-time employees and a discounted Employee Stock Purchase Program;•A 401(k) Savings Plan;•LiveMagenta: a custom-branded program for employee engagement and well-being, including free access to life coaches, financial coaches and tools for healthy living;•Access to personal health advocates offering independent guidance;•Tuition assistance for all full-time and part-time employees; and•A matching program for employee donations and volunteering.To keep our employees safe during the Pandemic, we implemented remote working arrangements for many employees with a significant portion of our internal and global care employees transitioned to a work-from-home environment. We also encouraged our corporate and administrative employees to work remotely, if possible. For employees who did not have this option, we provided access to incremental paid time off for employees experiencing symptoms, taking care of children who were home due to school closures or caring for individuals impacted by the Pandemic. We also continue to encourage healthy practices such as social distancing and hand washing and have increased cleaning and sanitation in all our facilities and stores. See “Our Response - To Protect and Support Our Employees and Communities” included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information on actions we took to support our employees during the Pandemic.Training and DevelopmentWe believe in providing opportunities for our employees to improve their skills and advance their careers. We do this through a variety of programs, including:•Award-winning career and development programs for all employees at all levels; •Transparent career paths available to employees and candidates that provide realistic progression timelines, salaries and expectations;•A Customer Care organization that uses 96 types of programs to train over 42,000 front line representatives and leaders;•A Leader-to-Executives Program that provides elite career track opportunities for select MBA students and graduates; and•Training for employees with disabilities pursuant to U.S. Department of Labor standards.Diversity, Equity and InclusionDiversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) have always been a part of the Un-carrier culture, and we are committed to having DE&I touch every aspect of our future as a bigger and better company. We are on a mission to increase diversity in leadership, talent pipelines, suppliers and customers while embedding inclusive behaviors across the business and investing in the communities we serve.We have established six DE&I Employee Resource Groups and four sub-affinity groups that have helped us establish and maintain a culture of inclusion. Currently, we have over 55 DE&I chapters across the nation that help spearhead volunteer opportunities, events and meaningful conversation with employees at a local level. Our DE&I networks include the following:•Accessibility Community at T-Mobile;•Multicultural Alliance;◦Asia Pacific & Allies Network;8Table of Contents◦Black Empowerment;◦Indigenous Peoples Network;◦Magenta Latinx Network;•Multigenerational Network;•Pride;•Veterans & Allies Network; and•Women & Allies Network. We have established an External Diversity and Inclusion Council in connection with our civil rights memorandum of understanding. The council includes civil rights leaders representing a wide-range of underrepresented communities. Together with T-Mobile, the council will help identify ways to improve our efforts in focus areas such as corporate governance, workforce recruitment and retention, procurement, entrepreneurship, philanthropy and community investment.Regulation The FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The FCC has a number of complex requirements that affect our operations and pending proceedings regarding additional or modified requirements that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly. Except for operations in certain unlicensed frequency bands, wireless communications services providers generally must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10-15 years depending on the particular licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such noncompliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, Congress’s and the FCC’s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (“CMRS”), which includes cellular, PCS and other wireless services, could significantly increase and intensify competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses or our competitive position in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers’ spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers. Congress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership through an entity controlling the licensee. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest, but must be reviewed and approved. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our Company by DT.For our Educational Broadband Service (“EBS”) licenses in the 2.5 GHz band, FCC rules previously limited eligibility to hold EBS licenses to accredited educational institutions and certain governmental, religious and nonprofit entities, while permitting those license holders to lease up to 95% of their capacity for non-educational purposes. Therefore, we primarily access EBS spectrum through long-term leasing arrangements with EBS license holders. Our EBS spectrum leases typically have an initial 9Table of Contentsterm equal to the remaining term of the EBS license, with an option to renew the lease for additional terms, for a total lease term of up to 30 years. On April 27, 2020, the FCC lifted the restriction on who can hold EBS licenses and the 30-year limitation on lease duration, among other changes. T-Mobile has started to acquire some of these EBS licenses but we continue to lease most of our spectrum in this band and expect that to be the case for some time. The elimination of these restrictions will allow and may encourage current license holders to sell their licenses to other parties, including to T-Mobile. While a majority of our leases have contractual provisions enabling us to match offers, we may be forced to compete with others to purchase 2.5 GHz licenses on the secondary market and expend additional capital earlier than we may have anticipated.While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communications services providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of devices while driving, zoning and land use. Notwithstanding this federal preemption, in response to the Pandemic, several state legislatures are considering bills that could potentially set prices, minimum performance standards, and/or restrictions on service discontinuation that could impact our business in those states.In addition, following the FCC’s adoption of the 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom (“RIF”) Order reclassifying broadband internet access services as Title I (non-common carrier services), a number of states have sought to impose state-specific net neutrality and privacy requirements on providers’ broadband services. The FCC’s RIF Order preempted such state efforts, which are inconsistent with the FCC’s federal deregulatory approach. Recently, however, the DC Circuit issued a ruling largely upholding the RIF Order, but also vacating the portion of the ruling broadly preempting state/local net neutrality laws. The court left open the prospect that particular state laws could still unlawfully conflict with the FCC net neutrality rules and be preempted; court challenges to some state enactments are pending. While most states are largely seeking to codify the repealed federal rules, there are differences in some states, notably California, which has passed separate privacy and net neutrality legislation. There are also efforts within Congress to pass federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirements, while also ensuring the preemption of separate state requirements, including the California laws. If not preempted or rescinded, separate state requirements will impose significant business costs and could also result in increased litigation costs and enforcement risks. State authority over wireless broadband services will remain unsettled until final action by the courts or Congress.In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other federal agencies have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are to some extent unknown, and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.

The information on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC.Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully inevaluating T-Mobile. Our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results, as well as the price of our common stock and other securities, could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. 10Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our Business and the Wireless IndustryThe Pandemic has adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our business, liquidity, financial condition and operating results. The Pandemic has impacted, and will continue to impact, the demand for our products and services, the ways in which our customers use them, where and how we work, and our suppliers and vendors’ ability to provide products to us. As a result, our business, liquidity, financial condition, and operating results have been, and will continue to be, adversely impacted by the Pandemic. To ensure the safety of both customers and employees, we continue to open, close, and limit capacity of our retail stores in compliance with local and state mandates and orders. However, even when we are able to open stores and provide safe and healthy operating environments, we have seen and may continue to see decreased traffic and therefore lower switching activity in the industry.In addition, the Pandemic has impacted customers’ ability to pay, and we expect to continue to work with them to help them maintain service and become current on their accounts, which may materially and adversely impact our financial results. These efforts may divert resources from our network buildout and put additional strain on our network, potentially leading to impacts on customer experience. Even after the Pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience impacts to our business as a result of the Pandemic’s global economic impact and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. Further, as the Pandemic situation is unprecedented and continuously evolving, the Pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or in a manner that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.Economic, political and market conditions, including those caused by the Pandemic, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.Our business, financial condition and operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, rates of inflation (or concerns about deflation), unemployment rates, economic growth, energy costs, and other macro-economic factors. Our services and device financing plans are available to a broad customer base, a significant segment of which may be vulnerable to weak economic conditions, particularly our subprime customers. We may have greater difficulty in gaining new customers within this segment, and existing customers may be more likely to terminate service and default on device financing plans due to an inability to pay.Further, because we offer a device leasing plan, we expect to realize economic benefit from the estimated residual value of a leased device, which reflects the estimated fair value of the underlying asset at the end of the expected lease term. Changes in residual value assumptions made at lease inception affect the amount of depreciation expense and the net amount of equipment under operating leases. If estimated residual values, in the aggregate, significantly decline due to economic factors, including COVID-19 impacts, obsolescence, or other circumstances, we may not realize such residual value. Sprint historically suffered, and we may suffer, negative consequences including increased costs and increased losses on devices as a result of a lease customer default, the related termination of a lease, and the attempted repossession of the device, including failure of a lease customer to return a leased device.Weak economic conditions and credit conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers, dealers, and MVNOs, some of which may file for bankruptcy, or may experience cash flow or liquidity problems, or may be unable to obtain or refinance credit such that they may no longer be able to operate. Any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market, or sell our products and services.Competition, industry consolidation, and changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We have multiple competitors, many of which possess either more or different access to strategic capital assets, and yet we compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings, price, network coverage, speed and quality and customer 11Table of Contentsservice. We expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry’s customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rates, leading to ongoing competition for customers. We also expect that our customers’ appetite for data services will place increasing demands on our network capacity. This competition and our capacity will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for a relatively fixed pool of customers with an ever-expanding variety of products and services. Our ability to compete will depend upon, among other things, continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality and customer service, effective marketing and selling of products and services, innovation, and attractive pricing, all of which will involve significant expenses.We face intense and increasing competition from other service providers as industry sectors converge, such as cable, telecom services and content, satellite, and other service providers. Companies such as Altice, Charter and DISH are diversifying outside cable, voice and broadband services to also offer wireless services. Competitors such as Comcast and AT&T provide original content services in addition to wireless, cable, voice and broadband services, and consumers are increasingly accessing video content from Internet-based providers and applications, all of which create increased competition in this area. These factors, together with the effects of the increasing aggregate penetration of wireless services in all metropolitan areas and the ability of our larger competitors to use resources to build out their networks and to quickly deploy advanced technologies, such as 5G, could make it more difficult for us to continue to attract and retain customers, and may adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances in the wireless sector have resulted in, and are expected to result in, larger competitors competing for a limited number of customers. Further consolidation, including the pending acquisition of TracFone Wireless by Verizon, could negatively impact our businesses, including wholesale. We will experience declining revenues from our wholesale business if Verizon migrates legacy TracFone customers off the T-Mobile network and DISH migrates Boost customers to their standalone network. Our competitors may also enter into exclusive handset, device, or content arrangements, execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaigns, or otherwise improve their cost position relative to ours. In addition, refusal of our competitors to provide critical access to resources and inputs, such as roaming and/or backhaul services, on reasonable terms could negatively impact our business.We could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches, whether directly or indirectly. Our business involves the receipt, storage and transmission of our customers’ confidential information, including sensitive personal information and payment card information, confidential information about our employees and suppliers, and other sensitive information about our Company, such as our business plans, transactions and intellectual property (collectively, “Confidential Information”). Unauthorized access to Confidential Information may be difficult to anticipate, detect, or prevent, particularly given that the methods of unauthorized access constantly change and evolve. We are subject to the threat of unauthorized access or disclosure of Confidential Information by state-sponsored parties, malicious actors, third parties or employees, errors or breaches by third-party suppliers, or other security incidents that could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of Confidential Information. We have previously notified affected customers of incidents involving unauthorized access to certain customer information in compliance with applicable laws concerning customer notice, and we expect we will provide such notices again. For example, in December 2020, we notified a small number of customers of unauthorized access to their account information that is considered “customer proprietary network information” by the FCC. More typically, such incidents involved attempts to commit fraud by taking control of a customer’s phone line. In a few cases, incidents involved unauthorized access to credit card information, financial data, social security numbers or passwords. While we do not believe these security incidents were material and actions were taken to prevent reoccurrence, we expect to continue to be the target of cyber-attacks, data breaches, or security incidents, which may in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.As a telecommunications carrier, we are considered a critical infrastructure provider and therefore may be more likely to be the target of cyber-attacks (e.g., denial of service and other malicious attacks). Such attacks against companies may be perpetrated by a variety of groups or persons, including those in jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are ineffective or unavailable, and such attacks may even be perpetrated by or at the behest of foreign governments.In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third-party service providers as part of our business operations. These third-party service providers have experienced data breaches and other attacks that included unauthorized access to Confidential Information in the past, and face security challenges common to all parties that collect and 12Table of Contentsprocess information. Past data breaches include a breach of the networks of one of our credit decisioning providers in September 2015, during which a subset of records containing current and potential customer information was acquired by an external party. Our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and to defend against attacks seeking to disrupt our services must be continually evaluated and revised to address the ever-evolving threat landscape. We cannot make assurances that all preventive actions taken will adequately repel a significant attack or prevent information security breaches or the misuses of data, unauthorized access by third parties or employees, or exploits against third-party supplier environments. If we or our third-party suppliers are subject to such attacks or security breaches, we may incur significant costs or other material financial impacts, which may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, our cyber insurance, be subject to regulatory investigations, sanctions and private litigation, experience disruptions to our operations or suffer damage to our reputation. Any future cyber-attacks, data breaches, or security incidents may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. The scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum, and regulations relating to spectrum use, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. As a result of completing the Transactions, we acquired additional spectrum from Sprint, including 2.5 GHz spectrum, that we need in order to continue our customer growth, expand and deepen our coverage, maintain our quality of service, meet increasing customer demands, and deploy new technologies. Although the Merger has reduced our immediate need to acquire additional spectrum, as we continue to enhance the quality of our services in certain geographic areas and deploy new technologies, including 5G, we may acquire additional spectrum in the future. As a result, we will continue to actively seek to make additional investment in spectrum, which could be significant.The continued interest in, and acquisition of, spectrum by existing carriers and others may reduce our ability to acquire and/or increase the cost of acquiring spectrum in the secondary market or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other means, including government auctions. Our return on investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customers and to provide additional services and usage to existing customers. Additionally, the FCC may not be able to provide sufficient additional spectrum to auction or we may be unable to secure the spectrum necessary to maintain or enhance our competitive position in any auction we may elect to participate in or in the secondary market, on favorable terms or at all.The FCC may impose conditions on the acquisition and use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas. If we cannot acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise, if competitors acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide services competitive with our services, or if we cannot deploy services over acquired spectrum on a timely basis without burdensome conditions, at reasonable cost, and while maintaining network quality levels, our ability to attract and retain customers and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.We rely on highly skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented personnel for all areas of our organization, including our CEO and the other members of our senior leadership team. In addition, certain members of our senior leadership team, including our CEO have term employment agreements with us. Our inability to extend the terms of these employment agreements or to replace these members of our senior leadership team at the end of their terms with qualified and capable successors could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, changes to U.S. immigration policy, competitors’ hiring practices, employee tolerance for the significant amount of change within and demands on our Company and our industry, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs.In addition, uncertainty about the process of integrating T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s businesses could have an adverse impact on our employees. These uncertainties may impact our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, as existing and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us. If key employees depart, our business could be negatively impacted. We may incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and replacing departing employees and may lose 13Table of Contentssignificant expertise and talent. As a result, we may not be able to meet our business plan and our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy. Significant technological changes continue to impact the communications industry. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, continually invest in our network, increase network capacity, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings to address our current and potential customers’ changing demands. Enhancing our network, including our 5G network, is subject to risk from equipment changes and migration of customers from older technologies. Adopting new and sophisticated technologies may result in implementation issues such as scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints, regulatory permitting issues, customer dissatisfaction, and other issues that could cause delays in launching new technological capabilities, which in turn could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the upgrades. If our new services fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with these services are higher than anticipated, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, brand, financial condition and operating results.System failures and business disruptions may allow unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other systems, which could materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition. To be successful, we must provide our customers with reliable, trustworthy service and protect the communications, location, and personal information shared or generated by our customers. We rely upon systems and networks - those of suppliers and other providers, in addition to our own - to provide and support our services and, in some cases, protect our customers’ information and our information. System, network or infrastructure failures may prevent us from providing reliable service or may allow for unauthorized use of or interference with our networks and other systems or the compromise of customer information. Examples of these risks include:•human error such as responding to deceptive communications or unintentionally executing malicious code;•physical damage, power surges or outages, or equipment failure with respect to both our wireless and wireline networks, including those as a result of severe weather and, natural disasters, public health crises, terrorist attacks, political instability and volatility, and acts of war;•theft of customer and/or proprietary information offered for sale for competitive advantage or corporate extortion;•unauthorized access to our IT and business systems or to our network and critical infrastructure and those of our suppliers and other providers;•supplier failures or delays; and•system failures or outages of our business systems or communications network.Such events could cause us to lose customers, lose revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational damage, and subject us to fines, penalties, adverse actions or judgments, litigation or governmental investigation. Remediation costs could include liability for information loss, costs of repairing infrastructure and systems, and/or costs of incentives offered to customers. Our insurance may not cover, or be adequate to fully reimburse us for, costs and losses associated with such events.The challenges in satisfying the large number of Government Commitments in the required time frames and the significant cumulative cost incurred in tracking, monitoring and complying with them could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In connection with the regulatory proceedings and approvals required to close the Transactions, we agreed to various Government Commitments. These Government Commitments include, among other things, extensive 5G network build-out commitments, obligations to deliver high-speed wireless services to the vast majority of Americans, and marketing an in-home broadband product to households where spectrum capacity is sufficient. Other Government Commitments relate to national security, pricing and availability of rate plans, employment, substantial monetary contributions to support organizations, and implementation of diversity and inclusion initiatives. The majority of the Government Commitments specify time frames for compliance and reporting. Failure to fulfill our obligations under these Government Commitments in a timely manner could result in substantial fines, penalties, or other legal and administrative actions.14Table of ContentsWe expect to incur significant costs, expenses and fees to track, monitor, comply with and fulfill our obligations under these Government Commitments. In addition, abiding by the Government Commitments may divert our management’s time and energy away from other business operations and could force us to make business decisions we would not otherwise make and forego taking actions that might be beneficial to the Company. The challenges in satisfying the large number of Government Commitments in the required time frames and the cost incurred in tracking, monitoring and complying with them could also adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results and hinder our ability to effectively compete.Our business may be adversely impacted if we are not able to successfully manage the ongoing commercial and transition services arrangements entered into in connection with the Divestiture Transaction and known or unknown liabilities arising in connection therewith.In connection with the closing of the Divestiture Transaction, we and DISH entered into certain commercial and transition services arrangements, including a Master Network Services Agreement (the “MNSA”) and a Spectrum Purchase Agreement (the “Spectrum Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the MNSA, DISH will receive network services from the Company for a period of seven years. As set forth in the MNSA, the Company will provide DISH, among other things, (a) legacy network services for certain Boost Mobile prepaid end users on the Sprint network, (b) T-Mobile network services for certain end users that have been migrated to the T-Mobile network or provisioned on the T-Mobile network by or on behalf of DISH and (c) infrastructure mobile network operator services to assist in the access and integration of the DISH network. Pursuant to the Spectrum Purchase Agreement, DISH has agreed to purchase all of Sprint’s 800 MHz spectrum (approximately 13.5 MHz of nationwide spectrum) for a total of approximately $3.6 billion; provided, however, that if DISH breaches the Spectrum Purchase agreement prior to the closing or fails to deliver the purchase price following the satisfaction or waiver of all closing conditions, DISH’s sole liability will be to pay us a fee of approximately $72 million. In such instance, T-Mobile may be required to conduct an auction sale of all of Sprint’s 800 MHz spectrum under the terms set forth in the Consent Decree, but would not be required to divest such spectrum for an amount less than $3.6 billion. The covered spectrum sale will not occur before the third anniversary of the Merger (i.e., not before April 1, 2023), but must be divested within the later of three years after the closing of the Divestiture Transaction and five days after receipt of the approval from the FCC for the transfer, following an application for FCC approval to be filed by the third anniversary of the closing of the Merger. T-Mobile may exercise an option to lease back 4 MHz (2 MHz downlink + 2 MHz uplink) of the spectrum for two years following the closing of the 800 MHz spectrum sale at the same per person rate used to calculate the purchase price paid by DISH to T-Mobile – a rate of approximately $68 million per year.Failure to successfully manage these ongoing commercial and transition services arrangements entered into in connection with the Divestiture Transaction and liabilities arising in connection therewith may result in material unanticipated problems, including diversion of management time and energy, significant expenses and liabilities. There may also be other potential adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses or liabilities associated with the Divestiture Transaction, the occurrence of which could materially impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and operating results. In addition, there may be an increase in competition from DISH and other third parties that DISH may enter into commercial agreements with, who are significantly larger and with greater resources and scale advantages as compared to us. Such increased competition may result in our loss of customers and other business relationships.Any acquisition, investment, or merger may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business. We may pursue acquisitions of, investments in or mergers with businesses, technologies, services and/or products that complement or expand our business. Some of these potential transactions could be significant relative to the size of our business and operations. Any such transaction would involve a number of risks and could present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:•diversion of management attention from running our existing business;•increased costs to integrate the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the business involved in any such transaction with our business;•difficulties in effectively integrating the financial and operational systems of the business involved in any such transaction into (or supplanting such systems with) our financial and operational reporting infrastructure and internal control framework in an effective and timely manner;•potential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process or as a result of any litigation arising in connection with any such transaction;•significant transaction-related expenses in connection with any such transaction, whether consummated or not;15Table of Contents•risks related to our ability to obtain any required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate any such transaction;•acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and any such financing could significantly increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings; and•any business, technology, service, or product involved in any such transaction may significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from the transaction, which could, among other things, also result in a write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with such transaction.For any or all of these reasons, acquisitions, investments, or mergers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We rely on third parties to provide products and services for the operation of our business, and the failure or inability of such parties to provide these products or services could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We depend heavily on suppliers, service providers, their subcontractors and other third parties for us to efficiently operate our business. Due to the complexity of our business, it is not unusual to engage a diverse set of suppliers to help us develop, maintain, and troubleshoot products and services such as wireless and wireline network components, software development services, and billing and customer service support. Some of our suppliers may provide services from outside of the United States, which carries additional regulatory and legal obligations. We commonly rely on suppliers to provide us with contractual assurances and to disclose accurate information regarding risks associated with their provision of products or services in accordance with our policies and standards, including our Supplier Code of Conduct and our third-party risk management practices. The failure of our suppliers to comply with our expectations and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Many of the products and services we use are available through multiple sources and suppliers. However, there are a limited number of suppliers who can support or provide billing services, voice and data communications transport services, wireless or wireline network infrastructure, equipment, handsets, other devices, and payment processing services, among other products and services. Disruptions or failure of such suppliers to adequately perform could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Our suppliers, service providers and their subcontractors may not perform at the levels we expect or at the levels required by their contracts. Our suppliers are also subject to their own risks, including, but not limited to, economic, financial and credit conditions and the risks of natural catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and public health crises such as the Pandemic. Our business could be severely disrupted if critical suppliers or service providers fail to comply with their contracts or if we experience delays or service degradation during any transition to a new outsourcing provider or other supplier or if we are required to replace the supplied products or services with those from another source, especially if the replacement becomes necessary on short notice. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Our financial condition and operating results will be negatively affected if we experience high fraud rates or volumes related to device financing, customer payment cards, third-party dealers, employees, subscriptions, identities or account takeover fraud. Our operating costs could increase substantially as a result of fraud, including any fraud related to device financing, customer payment cards, third-party dealers, employees, subscriptions, service use/abuse, or account takeover fraud. If our fraud strategies and processes are not successful in detecting, mitigating, and preventing fraud, the resulting loss of revenue or increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operation results. This includes fraudulent activities perpetrated directly against us or through the systems, processes, and operations of third parties such as national retailers, dealers, and others.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business flexibility and increase our borrowing costs.We have, and we expect that we will continue to have, a substantial amount of debt. Our substantial level of indebtedness could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business, economic, market and 16Table of Contentsindustry conditions and increasing the amount of cash required to service our debt. In addition, this level of indebtedness may reduce funds available to support efforts to integrate T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s businesses and realize the expected benefits of the Transactions, and may also reduce funds available for capital expenditures, share repurchases and other activities. Those impacts may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Further, we may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, which could increase the risks associated with our capital structure.Because of our substantial indebtedness, there is a risk that we may not be able to service our debt obligations in accordance with their terms.Our ability to service our substantial debt obligations will depend on future performance, which will be affected by business, economic, market and industry conditions and other factors, including our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the Transactions. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations when due. If we are unable to meet such obligations or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing such debt obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices or make additional borrowings. We may not be able to, at any given time, refinance our debt, sell assets or make additional borrowings on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.In addition, instability in the global financial markets could lead to periodic volatility in the credit, equity, and fixed income markets. This volatility could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.Some or all of our variable-rate indebtedness may use the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR will be discontinued after 2021 and will be replaced with an alternative reference rate. The consequence of this development cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness. In addition, any hedging agreements we have and may continue to enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations may not offer complete protection from these risks or may be unsuccessful, and consequently may effectively increase the interest rate we pay on our debt or the exchange rate with respect to such debt, and any portion not subject to such hedging agreements would have full exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations, as applicable. If any financial institutions that are parties to our hedging agreements were to default on their payment obligations to us, declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, we would be unhedged against the underlying exposures. Any posting of collateral by us under our hedging agreements and the modification or termination of any of our hedging agreements could negatively impact our liquidity or other financial metrics. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financings include restrictive covenants that limit our operatingflexibility.The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financings impose material operating and financial restrictions. These restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions and maintenance and incurrence-based financial tests, together with our debt service obligations, may limit our ability to engage in transactions and pursue strategic business opportunities, including the following:•incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock;•paying dividends, redeeming capital stock or making other restricted payments or investments;•selling, buying or leasing assets, properties or licenses, including spectrum;•developing assets, properties or licenses that we have or in the future may procure;•creating liens on assets securing indebtedness or other obligations;•participating in future FCC auctions of spectrum or private sales of spectrum;•engaging in mergers, acquisitions, business combinations or other transactions;•entering into transactions with affiliates; and•our subsidiaries paying dividends or making other payments to us.17Table of ContentsThese restrictions could limit our ability to obtain debt financing, make share repurchases, refinance or pay principal on our outstanding indebtedness, complete acquisitions for cash or indebtedness or react to business, economic, market and industry conditions and other changes in our operating environment or the economy. Any future indebtedness that we incur may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our debt agreements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these and other agreements, giving our lenders the right to terminate the commitments they had made or the right to require us to repay all amounts then outstanding plus any interest, fees, penalties or premiums. An event of default may also compel us to sell certain assets securing indebtedness under these agreements.Credit rating downgrades could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and operating results, which rely on investment-grade markets. Credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, as a result, cost of capital. Our current ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. Our capital structure and business model are reliant on continued access to the investment-grade debt markets. Each rating agency reviews our ratings periodically, and there can be no assurance that such ratings will be maintained in the future. A downgrade in our corporate rating and/or our issued investment-grade debt ratings, or our amount of secured debt outstanding, could impact our ability to access the investment-grade debt market and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and operating results. Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory MattersAny material weaknesses we identify while we work to integrate and align policies, principles and practices of the two companies following the Merger, or any other failure by us to maintain effective internal controls, could result in a loss of investor confidence regarding our financial statements. Additionally, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital could be negatively impacted, and we could be subject to significant costs and reputational damage that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we, along with our independent registered public accounting firm, are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This requirement is subject to an exemption for business combinations during the most recent fiscal year, which we are utilizing due to the Merger. Any identified material weakness in internal control over financial reporting would still be reported, as obligated. While we integrate and align the policies, principles and practices of the two companies following the Merger, as a result of the differences in control environments and cultures, we could identify material weaknesses that could result in materially inaccurate financial statements, materially inaccurate disclosures, or failure to prevent error or fraud for the combined company. There can be no assurance that remediation of any material weaknesses identified during integration of the two companies will be completed in a timely manner or that the remedial measures will prevent other control deficiencies or material weaknesses. If we are unable to remediate material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, then our ability to analyze, record and report financial information free of material misstatements, to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC and otherwise to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will be negatively impacted. The impact could negatively impact our business, financial condition or operating results, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require the expenditure of significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies, subject us to fines, penalties, investigations or judgments, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.Changes in regulations or in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We are subject to regulatory oversight by various federal, state and local agencies, as well as judicial review and actions, on issues related to the wireless industry that include, but are not limited to, roaming, interconnection, spectrum allocation and licensing, facilities siting, pole attachments, intercarrier compensation, Universal Service Fund, 911 services, consumer protection, consumer privacy, and cybersecurity. We are also subject to regulations in connection with other aspects of our business, including device financing and insurance activities.The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale, and interconnection of wireless communications systems, as do some state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation 18Table of Contentson licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and the resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. Additionally, the FTC and other federal and state agencies have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection, and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of wireless products and services. We cannot assure that the FCC or any other federal, state or local agencies will not adopt regulations, implement new programs in response to the Pandemic, or take enforcement or other actions that would adversely affect our business, impose new costs, or require changes in current or planned operations. For example, in response to the Pandemic, T-Mobile implemented the Keep Americans Connected Pledge in March 2020, in which we pledged, through June 2020, to not terminate service for certain customers failing to pay their bills due to the Pandemic, to waive any such customers’ late fees, and to open our Wi-Fi hotspots to any American who needs them. Similarly, in response to the Pandemic, starting in January 2021 and extending at least 90 days, the California Public Utilities Commission adopted a resolution providing a moratorium on customer disconnects and late fees for certain California customers facing financial hardship. Additionally, under the Obama administration, the FCC established net neutrality and privacy regimes that applied to our operations. Both sets of rules potentially subjected some of our initiatives and practices to more burdensome requirements and heightened scrutiny by federal and state regulators, the public, edge providers, and private litigants regarding whether such initiatives or practices are compliant. While the FCC rules were largely rolled back under the Trump administration, the FCC could possibly revisit that decision under the Biden administration. In addition, some states and other jurisdictions have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws in these areas (including, for example, the CCPA and CPRA as discussed below), and it is uncertain what rules may be promulgated under the Biden administration, perpetuating the risk and uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment and compliance around these issues.In addition, states are increasingly focused on the quality of service and support that wireless communications services providers provide to their customers and several states have proposed or enacted new and potentially burdensome regulations in this area. We also face potential investigations by, and inquiries from or actions by state public utility commissions. We also cannot assure that Congress will not amend the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, and which serves to limit state authority, or enact other legislation in a manner that could be adverse to our business. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We could be subject to fines, forfeitures, and other penalties (including, in extreme cases, revocation of our spectrum licenses) for failure to comply with FCC or other governmental regulations, even if any such noncompliance was unintentional. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Laws and regulations relating to the handling of privacy and data protection may result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage.In January 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) became effective, creating new data privacy rights for California residents and new compliance obligations for us. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant implementation costs to ensure compliance with the CCPA, and we could see increased litigation costs. Moreover, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), was passed by Californians via ballot initiative during the November 3, 2020 election. The CPRA, which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023 (with a lookback to January 1, 2022), will significantly modify the CCPA and will impose additional data protection obligations on companies such as ours doing business in California. Other states (such as Nevada) have passed or are considering similar legislation (such as Washington), which could create more risks and potential costs for us, especially to the extent the specific requirements vary from those in California, Nevada and other existing laws.We have incurred and will continue to incur significant implementation costs to ensure compliance with the CCPA, the CPRA, and their related regulations and any additional laws and regulations could cause us to incur further costs or further constrain our business, strategies, offerings and initiatives.Unfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We and our affiliates are involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, investigations and proceedings and litigation matters. Such legal proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energy of management and other key personnel.19Table of ContentsIn connection with the Transactions, it is possible that stockholders of T-Mobile and/or Sprint may file putative class action lawsuits or shareholder derivative actions against the Company and the legacy T-Mobile board of directors and/or the legacy Sprint board of directors. Among other remedies, these stockholders could seek damages. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain and any such potential lawsuits could result in substantial costs and may be costly and distracting to management.Additionally, on April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed the contingencies and litigation matters of Sprint. Those matters include a wide variety of disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions and other proceedings, including, among other things, certain ongoing FCC and state government agency investigations into Sprint’s Lifeline program. In September 2019, Sprint notified the FCC that it had claimed monthly subsidies for serving customers even though those customers may not have met usage requirements under Sprint’s usage policy for the Lifeline program due to an inadvertent coding issue in the system used to identify qualifying customer usage that occurred in July 2017 while the system was being updated. Sprint has made a number of payments to reimburse the federal government and certain states for excess subsidy payments. Unfavorable resolution of these matters could require making additional reimbursements and paying additional fines and penalties. On February 28, 2020, we received a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Admonishment from the FCC, which proposed a penalty against us for allegedly violating Section 222 of the Communications Act and the FCC’s regulations governing the privacy of customer information. We recorded an accrual for an estimated payment amount as of March 31, 2020, which was included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We, along with equipment manufacturers and other carriers, are subject to current and potential future lawsuits alleging adverse health effects arising from the use of wireless handsets or from wireless transmission equipment such as cell towers. In addition, the FCC has from time to time gathered data regarding wireless device emissions, and its assessment of the risks associated with using wireless devices may evolve based on its findings. Any of these allegations or changes in risk assessments could result in customers purchasing fewer devices and wireless services, could result in significant legal and regulatory liability, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.The assessment of the outcome of legal proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or pursuant to final judgment, order or decree may differ materially from amounts accrued in our financial statements. In addition, litigation or similar proceedings could impose restraints on our current or future manner of doing business. Such potential outcomes including judgments, awards, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We offer regulated financial services products. These products expose us to a wide variety of state and federal regulations. The financing of devices, such as through our EIP, JUMP! On Demand or other leasing programs, such as those acquired in the Merger, has expanded our regulatory compliance obligations. Failure to remain compliant with applicable regulations may increase our risk exposure in the following areas:•consumer complaints and potential examinations or enforcement actions by federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, state attorneys general, the FCC and the FTC; and•regulatory fines, penalties, enforcement actions, civil litigation, and/or class action lawsuits.Failure to comply with applicable regulations and the realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Our business may be impacted by new or amended tax laws or regulations or administrative interpretations and judicial decisions affecting the scope or application of tax laws or regulations. In connection with the products and services we sell, we calculate, collect, and remit various federal, state, and local taxes, fees and regulatory charges (“tax” or “taxes”) to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including federal and state USF contributions and common carrier regulatory charges and public safety fees. In addition, we incur and pay state and local transaction taxes and fees on purchases of goods and services used in our business.20Table of ContentsTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In many cases, the application of existing, newly enacted or amended tax laws (such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 or the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) may be uncertain and subject to different interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services, such as broadband internet access and cloud related services and in the context of our recent merger with Sprint. Legislative changes, administrative interpretations and judicial decisions affecting the scope or application of tax laws could also impact revenue reported and taxes due on tax inclusive plans.In the event that T-Mobile, including pre-acquisition Sprint, has incorrectly described, disclosed, determined, calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts that were due to governmental authorities, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In the event that federal, state, and/or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes and regulatory or public safety charges on our network, operations, or services, or seek to impose new taxes or charges, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Our wireless licenses are subject to renewal and may be revoked in the event that we violate applicable laws. Our existing wireless licenses are subject to renewal upon the expiration of the period for which they are granted. Our licenses have been granted with an expectation of renewal and the FCC has approved our license renewal applications. However, the Communications Act provides that licenses may be revoked for cause and license renewal applications denied if the FCC determines that a renewal would not serve the public interest. If we fail to timely file to renew any wireless license or fail to meet any regulatory requirements for renewal, including construction and substantial service requirements, we could be denied a license renewal. Many of our wireless licenses are subject to interim or final construction requirements and there is no guarantee that the FCC will find our construction, or the construction of prior licensees, sufficient to meet the build-out or renewal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure that the FCC will renew our wireless licenses upon their expiration. If any of our wireless licenses were to be revoked or not renewed upon expiration, we would not be permitted to provide services under that license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockEach of DT, which controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock, and SoftBank, a significant stockholder of T-Mobile, may have interests that differ from the interests of our other stockholders. Upon the completion of the Transactions, DT and SoftBank entered into the SoftBank Proxy Agreement, and on June 22, 2020, DT, Claure Mobile LLC (“CM LLC”), and Marcelo Claure entered into a Proxy, Lock-up and ROFR Agreement (“the Claure Proxy Agreement,” together with the SoftBank Proxy Agreement, the “Proxy Agreements”). Pursuant to the Proxy Agreements, at any meeting of our stockholders, the shares of our common stock beneficially owned by SoftBank or CM LLC will be voted in the manner as directed by DT.Accordingly, DT controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock and therefore we are a “controlled company,” as defined in The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) listing rules, and we are not subject to NASDAQ requirements that would otherwise require us to have a majority of independent directors, a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors. Accordingly, our stockholders will not be afforded the same protections generally as stockholders of other NASDAQ-listed companies with respect to corporate governance for so long as we rely on these exemptions from the corporate governance requirements.In addition, pursuant to our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (“Certificate of Incorporation”) and the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement, as long as DT beneficially owns 30% or more of our outstanding common stock, we are restricted from taking certain actions without DT’s prior written consent, including (i) incurring indebtedness above certain levels based on a specified debt to cash flow ratio, (ii) taking any action that would cause a default under any instrument evidencing indebtedness involving DT or its affiliates, (iii) acquiring or disposing of assets or entering into mergers or similar acquisitions in excess of $1.0 billion, (iv) changing the size of our board of directors, (v) subject to certain exceptions, issuing equity of 10% or more of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock, or issuing equity to redeem debt held by DT, (vi) repurchasing or redeeming equity securities or making any extraordinary or in-kind dividend other than on a pro rata basis, or (vii) making certain changes involving our CEO. We are also restricted from amending our Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws in any manner that could adversely affect DT’s rights under the Second Amended and 21Table of ContentsRestated Stockholders’ Agreement for as long as DT beneficially owns 5% or more of our outstanding common stock. These restrictions could prevent us from taking actions that our board of directors may otherwise determine are in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders or that may be in the best interests of our other stockholders.DT effectively has control over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, changes to our Certificate of Incorporation, a sale or merger of our Company and other transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law. DT’s controlling interest may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, the Company. DT and SoftBank, as significant stockholders, may have strategic, financial, or other interests different from our other stockholders, including as the holder of a substantial amount of our indebtedness and as the counterparty in a number of commercial arrangements, and may make decisions adverse to the interests of our other stockholders.In addition, we license certain trademarks from DT, including the right to use the trademark “T-Mobile” as a name for the Company and our flagship brand, under a trademark license agreement, as amended, with DT. As described in more detail in our Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on April 21, 2020 under the heading “Transactions with Related Persons and Approval,” we are obligated to pay DT a royalty in an amount equal to 0.25% (the “royalty rate”) of the net revenue (as defined in the trademark license) generated by products and services sold by the Company under the licensed trademarks subject to a cap of $80.0 million per calendar year through December 31, 2028. We and DT are obligated to negotiate a new trademark license when (i) DT has 50% or less of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or (ii) any third party owns or controls, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or otherwise has the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Company. If we and DT fail to agree on a new trademark license, either we or DT may terminate the trademark license and such termination shall be effective, in the case of clause (i) above, on the third anniversary after notice of termination and, in the case of clause (ii) above, on the second anniversary after notice of termination. A further increase in the royalty rate or termination of the trademark license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Future sales of our common stock by DT and SoftBank and foreign ownership limitations by the FCC could have a negative impact on our stock price and decrease the value of our stock.We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock by DT or SoftBank will have on the prevailing trading price of our common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline.We, DT and SoftBank are parties to the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement pursuant to which DT and SoftBank are free to transfer their shares in public sales without notice, as long as such transactions would not result in a third party owning more than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If a transfer would exceed the 30% threshold, it is prohibited unless the transfer is approved by our board of directors or the transferee makes a binding offer to purchase all of the other outstanding shares on the same price and terms. The Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement does not otherwise impose any other restrictions on the sales of common stock by DT or SoftBank. Moreover, we may be required to file a shelf registration statement with respect to the common stock and certain debt securities of ours held by DT and SoftBank, which would facilitate the resale by DT or SoftBank of all or any portion of such shares of our common stock or debt securities they hold. The sale of shares of our common stock by DT or SoftBank (other than in transactions involving the purchase of all of our outstanding shares) could significantly increase the number of shares available in the market, which could cause a decrease in our stock price. In addition, even if DT or SoftBank does not sell a large number of their shares into the market, their right to transfer a large number of shares into the market may depress our stock price.Furthermore, under existing law, no more than 20% of an FCC licensee’s capital stock may be directly owned, or no more than 25% indirectly owned, or voted by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, by a foreign government or its representatives or by a foreign corporation. If an FCC licensee is controlled by another entity, up to 25% of that entity’s capital stock may be owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, by a foreign government or its representatives or by a foreign corporation. Foreign ownership above the 25% holding company level may be allowed if the FCC finds such higher levels consistent with the public interest. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest with respect to investors from certain nations. If our foreign ownership by previously unapproved foreign parties were to exceed the permitted level, the FCC could subject us to a range of penalties, including an order for us to divest the foreign ownership in part, fines, license revocation or denials of license renewals. If ownership of our common stock by an unapproved foreign entity were to become subject to such limitations, or if any 22Table of Contentsownership of our common stock violates any other rule or regulation of the FCC applicable to us, our Certificate of Incorporation provides for certain redemption provisions at a pre-determined price which may be less than fair market value. These limitations and our Certificate of Incorporation may limit our ability to attract additional equity financing outside the United States and decrease the value of our common stock.Our stock price may be volatile and may fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results. The trading prices of the securities of communications companies historically have been highly volatile, and the trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations. Our stock price may fluctuate in reaction to a number of events and factors that may include, among other things:•adverse economic, political or market conditions in the U.S. and international markets, including those caused by the Pandemic;•our or our competitors’ actual or anticipated operating and financial results; •introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors or changes in service plans or pricing by us or our competitors;•analyst projections, predictions and forecasts, analyst target prices for our securities and changes in, or our failure to meet, securities analysts’ expectations;•realization of the expected benefits and synergies of the Transactions, or market or analyst expectations with respect thereto;•transactions in our common stock by major investors;•share repurchases by us or purchases by DT or SoftBank;•the potential issuance to SoftBank of the SoftBank Specified Shares Amount, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Letter Agreement (see Note 2 - Business Combination of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information);•DT’s financial performance and results of operations, or actions implied or taken by DT or SoftBank;•entry of new competitors into our markets or perceptions of increased price competition, including a price war;•our performance, including customer growth, and our financial and operational performance;•market perceptions relating to our services, network, handsets, and deployment of our LTE and 5G platforms and our access to iconic handsets, services, applications, or content;•market perceptions of the wireless communications services industry and valuation models for us and the industry;•conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry sectors in which we operate;•changes in our credit rating or future prospects;•changes in interest rates;•changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;•the availability or perceived availability of additional capital in general and our access to such capital;•actual or anticipated consolidation or other strategic mergers or acquisition activities involving us or our competitors, or other participants in related or adjacent industries, or market speculation regarding such activities;•disruptions of our operations or the operations of service providers or other vendors necessary to our network operations; and•availability of additional spectrum, whether by the announcement, commencement, bidding and closing of auctions for new spectrum or the acquisition of companies that own spectrum, and the extent to which we or our competitors succeed in acquiring additional spectrum.In addition, the stock market has been volatile and has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the past, which may continue for the foreseeable future. Severe market fluctuations, such as those experienced recently with regard to the Pandemic, oil and other commodity prices, concerns over sovereign debt risk, trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, and those that may arise from global and political tensions or weak economic conditions, have had and may continue to have a significant impact on the trading price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in the communications industry. These changes frequently occur irrespective of the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the trading price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results.23Table of ContentsWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our credit facilities and indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to use future earnings, if any, to invest in our business and for general corporate purposes, including the integration of T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s businesses and the continued build-out of our 5G network. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of potential gain. Risks Related to Integration Although we expect that the Transactions will result in synergies and other benefits, those synergies and benefits may not be realized in the amounts anticipated, or may not be realized within the expected time frame, and risks associated with the foregoing may also result from the extended delay in the integration of the companies. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate our and Sprint’s businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the projected cost savings. In addition, some of the anticipated synergies are not expected to occur for a significant time period following the completion of the Transactions and will require substantial capital expenditures in the near term.As a result of the delays experienced in the completion of the Transactions and the Pandemic, our anticipated synergies and other benefits of the Transactions may be reduced or eliminated, including a delay in the integration of, or inability to integrate, the networks of T-Mobile and Sprint. Even if we are able to integrate the two companies successfully, the anticipated benefits of the Transactions, including the expected synergies and network benefits, may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.We have incurred substantial expenses as a result of completing the Transactions. We expect to incur substantial additional expenses in connection with integrating T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s businesses, operations, policies and procedures and compliance with the Government Commitments. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction-related expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could exceed the costs historically borne by us and offset the expected synergies.Our business and Sprint’s business may not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected. Operating costs, customer loss and business disruption, including maintaining relationships with employees, customers, suppliers or vendors, may be greater than expected. The combination of two independent businesses is complex, costly and time-consuming, and may divert significant management attention and resources. This process may disrupt our business or otherwise impact our ability to compete. The overall combination of our and Sprint’s businesses may also result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses and impacts, and loss of customers and other business relationships. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:•diversion of management attention to integration matters;•difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including intellectual property and communications systems, administrative and information technology infrastructure, and supplier and vendor arrangements;•challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies;•alignment of key performance measurements may result in a greater need to communicate and manage clear expectations while we work to integrate and align policies and practices;•difficulties in integrating employees; •the transition of management to the combined company management team, and the need to address possible differences in corporate cultures, management philosophies, and compensation structures;•challenges in retaining existing customers and obtaining new customers;24Table of Contents•difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;•possible delays, disputes, or regulatory issues in connection with the finalizing and consummation of an asset purchase agreement between Sprint PCS and Shentel for all of Shentel’s wireless assets and customers, and any associated adverse effects on the operations and business in the Shentel service area;•compliance with Government Commitments relating to national security;•known or potential unknown liabilities of Sprint that are larger than expected; •other potential adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses or liabilities associated with the Transactions.Additionally, uncertainties over the integration process could cause customers, suppliers, distributors, dealers, retailers and others to seek to change or cancel our existing business relationships or to refuse to renew existing relationships. Suppliers, distributors and content and application providers may also delay or cease developing new products for us that are necessary for the operations of our business due to uncertainties. Competitors may also target our existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties.Some of these factors are outside our control, and any one of them could result in lower revenues, higher costs and diversion of management time and energy, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, even if the integration is successful, the full benefits of the Transactions including, among others, the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities may not be realized. As a result, it cannot be assured that we will realize the full benefits expected from the Transactions within the anticipated time frames or at all.In connection with the Merger, we are evaluating the long-term billing system architecture strategy for our customers. Our long-term strategy is to migrate Sprint’s legacy customers onto T-Mobile’s existing billing platforms. We will operate and maintain multiple billing systems until such migration is completed. Any unanticipated difficulties, disruption, or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial, and reputational effects on our business. Following the closing of the Merger, we are operating and maintaining multiple billing systems. We expect to continue to do so until successful migration of Sprint’s legacy customers to T-Mobile’s existing billing platforms. We may encounter unanticipated difficulties or experience delays in the ongoing integration efforts with respect to billing, causing major system or business disruptions. In addition, we or our supporting vendors may experience errors, cyber-attacks or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact us and over which we may have limited control. Interruptions and/or failure of these billing systems could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to provide or bill for our services, retain customers, attract new customers or negatively impact overall customer experience. Any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition, and/or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and reputational damage.Item 1B.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket InformationOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “TMUS.” We are included within the S&P 500 in the Wireless Telecommunication Services GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard) Sub-Industry index. As of January 31, 2021, there were 16,299 registered stockholders of record of our common stock, but we estimate the total number of stockholders to be much higher as a number of our shares are held by brokers or dealers for their customers in street name.We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our credit facilities and indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to use future earnings, if any, to invest in our business and for general corporate purposes, including the integration of T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s businesses. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of potential gain.Performance GraphThe graph below compares the five-year cumulative total returns of T-Mobile, the S&P 500 index, the NASDAQ Composite index and the Dow Jones US Mobile Telecommunications TSM index.

Our financial results include the consolidated operations of T-Mobile and Sprint subsequent to the date of Merger close.(2)On January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” and all the related amendments (collectively, the “new lease standard”), using the modified retrospective method with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application. Comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the standards in effect for those periods. (3)On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” and all the related amendments (collectively, the “new revenue standard”), using the modified retrospective method with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application. Comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the standards in effect for those periods. (4)In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) was signed into legislation. The TCJA included numerous changes to existing tax law, including a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The rate reduction took place on January 1, 2018. We recognized a net tax benefit of $2.2 billion associated with the enactment of the TCJA in Income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. (5)On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” (the “new cash flow standard”) which impacted the presentation of our cash flows related to our beneficial interests in securitization transactions, which is the deferred purchase price, resulting in a reclassification of cash inflows from Operating activities to Investing activities of approximately $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The new cash flow standard also impacted the presentation of our cash payments for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs, resulting in a reclassification of cash outflows from Operating activities to Financing activities of $188 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. There were no cash payments for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs during the year ended December 31, 2016. We have applied the new cash flow standard retrospectively to all periods presented. (6)In connection with obtaining regulatory approval for the Merger, on July 1, 2020, DISH acquired the prepaid wireless business operated under the Boost Mobile and Sprint prepaid brands (excluding the Assurance brand Lifeline customers and the prepaid wireless customers of Shentel and Swiftel Communications, Inc.), the results of which prior to the divestiture are presented in Income from discontinued operations, net of tax.29Table of ContentsItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewThe objectives of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) are to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with the following:•A narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results;•Context to the financial statements; and•Information that allows assessment of the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.Our MD&A is performed on a consolidated basis and is inclusive of the results and operations of Sprint prospectively from the close of our Merger on April 1, 2020. The Merger enhanced our spectrum portfolio, increased our customer base, altered our product mix by increasing the portion of customers who finance their devices with leasing programs and created opportunity for synergies in our operations. We anticipate an initial increase in our combined operating costs which we expect to decrease as we realize synergies. We expect the trends and results of operations of the combined company to be materially different than those of the standalone entities.Our MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our MD&A are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.Beginning with the second quarter of 2020, we have discontinued the use of “Branded” to describe the results and metrics associated with our flagship brands including T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile. Sprint MergerTransaction OverviewOn April 1, 2020, we completed our Merger with Sprint, a communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services. As a result, Sprint and its subsidiaries became wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of T-Mobile.The Merger has altered the size and scope of our operations, impacting our assets, liabilities, obligations, capital requirements and performance measures. We expect the trends and results of operations of the combined company to be materially different than those of the standalone entities. As a combined company, we expect to be able to enhance the breadth and depth of our nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation, increase competition in the U.S. wireless, video and broadband industries and achieve significant synergies and cost reductions by eliminating redundancies within the combined network as well as other business processes and operations.For more information regarding the Merger, see Note 2 – Business Combination of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.On June 22, 2020, we entered into a Master Framework Agreement and related transactions with SoftBank to facilitate the SoftBank Monetization as described in Note 14 - SoftBank Equity Transaction of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.30Table of ContentsBrand and Retail UnificationOn August 2, 2020, we combined the Sprint and T-Mobile operations under the T-Mobile brand nationwide. We combined our retail operations and rebranded thousands of Sprint stores to T-Mobile stores while implementing the tools and systems across our distribution footprint to serve all customers in all stores. Sale of Boost Mobile and Sprint Prepaid BrandsIn connection with obtaining regulatory approval for the Merger, on July 1, 2020, DISH acquired the prepaid wireless business operated under the Boost Mobile and Sprint prepaid brands (excluding the Assurance brand Lifeline customers and the prepaid wireless customers of Shentel and Swiftel Communications, Inc.), including customer accounts, inventory, contracts, intellectual property and certain other specified assets (the “Prepaid Business”), and assumed certain related liabilities (the “Prepaid Transaction”). For more information, see Note 12 - Discontinued Operations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Upon the closing of the Prepaid Transaction, we entered into a Master Network Services Agreement (the “MVNO Agreement”) providing for the provisioning of network services to customers of the Prepaid Business for a period of up to seven years following the closing of the Prepaid Transaction. The revenue generated through this agreement is presented within Wholesale revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income following the close of the Prepaid Transaction on July 1, 2020. We included the pre-tax results of our discontinued operations in our determination of Adjusted EBITDA, a Non-GAAP measure, to reflect contributions of the Prepaid Business that was replaced by the MVNO Agreement beginning on July 1, 2020. See “Adjusted EBITDA” in the “Performance Measures” section of this MD&A.Merger-Related CostsMerger-related costs generally include:•Integration costs to achieve efficiencies in network, retail, information technology and back office operations;•Restructuring costs, including severance, store rationalization and network decommissioning; and•Transaction costs, including legal and professional services related to the completion of the Merger.Transaction and restructuring costs are disclosed in Note 2 – Business Combination and Note 19 - Restructuring Costs, respectively. Merger-related costs have been excluded from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as we do not consider these costs to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance. See “Adjusted EBITDA” in the “Performance Measures” section of this MD&A. Cash payments for Merger-related costs, including payments related to our restructuring plan, are included in Net cash provided by operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Merger-related costs during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are presented below:(in millions)Year Ended December 31,2020 Versus 20192019 Versus 2018202020192018$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeMerger-related costsCost of services, exclusive of depreciation and amortization$646 $— $— $646 NM$— NMCost of equipment sales6 — — 6 NM— NMSelling, general and administrative1,263 620 196 643 104 %424 216 %Total Merger-related costs$1,915 $620 $196 $1,295 209 %$424 216 %Cash payments for Merger-related costs$1,493 $442 $86 $1,051 238 %$356 414 %NM - Not MeaningfulMerger-related costs will be impacted by restructuring and integration activities expected to occur over the next three years as we implement initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from the Merger. Transaction costs, including legal and professional service fees related to the completion of the Merger, are expected to decrease in periods subsequent to the close of the Merger.31Table of ContentsRestructuringUpon the close of the Merger, we began implementing restructuring initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from the Merger. The major activities associated with the restructuring initiatives to date include:•Contract termination costs associated with rationalization of retail stores, distribution channels, duplicative network and backhaul services and other agreements;•Severance costs associated with the reduction of redundant processes and functions; and•The decommissioning of certain small cell sites and distributed antenna systems to achieve synergies in network costs. Anticipated ImpactsOur restructuring activities are expected to occur over the next three years with substantially all costs incurred by the end of fiscal year 2023. We are evaluating additional restructuring initiatives which are dependent on consultations and negotiation with certain counterparties and the expected impact on our business operations, which could affect the amount or timing of the restructuring costs and related payments. We expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements and anticipated payments associated with the restructuring initiatives. As a result of our ongoing restructuring activities, we expect to realize cost efficiencies by eliminating redundancies within our combined network as well as other business processes and operations. We expect these activities to result in a reduction of expenses within Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected businesses, economies, and financial markets worldwide, and has caused significant volatility in the U.S. and international debt and equity markets. The impact of the Pandemic has been wide-ranging, including, but not limited to, the temporary closures of many businesses and schools, “shelter in place” orders, travel restrictions, social distancing guidelines and other governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the Pandemic. These restrictions have impacted, and will continue to impact, our business, including the demand for our products and services and the ways in which our customers purchase and use them. In addition, the Pandemic has resulted in economic uncertainty and a significant increase in unemployment in the United States, which could affect our customers’ purchasing decisions and ability to make timely payments. Throughout the year, the Pandemic has peaked, subsided and seen a resurgence, leading to phased re-openings, as well as continuing or renewed containment measures.As a critical communications infrastructure provider as designated by the government, our focus has been on providing crucial connectivity to our customers and impacted communities while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees. Our ResponseWe have taken a variety of steps to help mitigate the impact of the Pandemic on our customers and to protect the health and well-being of our workforce and communities: To Protect and Support Our Employees and Communities•Before the Merger, in mid-March, approximately 80% of T-Mobile and 70% of Sprint company-owned store locations, as well as many third-party retailer locations that sell our T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile and Sprint brands were temporarily closed. In compliance with the regulations of various states, we have since reopened substantially all of our previously closed stores.•At the onset of the Pandemic, we supplemented pay for certain of our employees and commissions for third-party dealers and provided access to incremental paid time off for employees experiencing symptoms, taking care of children who were home due to school closures or caring for individuals impacted by the Pandemic.32Table of Contents•We implemented remote working arrangements for many employees with a significant portion of our internal and global care employees transitioned to a work-from-home environment. We also encouraged our corporate and administrative employees to work remotely, if possible.•We also continue to encourage healthy practices such as social distancing and hand washing and have increased cleaning and sanitation in all our facilities and stores.To Keep Our Customers Connected•In March, we committed to the FCC’s Keep Americans Connected pledge, and at the FCC’s request, later extended our commitment to June 30, 2020. During this period, we pledged to:•Not terminate service to any residential or small business customers because of their inability to pay their bills due to disruptions caused by the Pandemic; and•Waive any late fees that any residential or small business customers incurred because of their economic circumstances related to the Pandemic.•After the Pledge extension ended, we continued to work with our customers to help them maintain service and become current on their accounts, while avoiding financial hardship.•We also took additional temporary steps in March to ensure that all current T-Mobile customers with smartphone data plans were provided connectivity to learn and work remotely through June 30, 2020, including:•Providing unlimited high-speed smartphone data to current customers as of March 13, 2020 who had legacy plans without unlimited high-speed data (excluding roaming);•Giving T-Mobile postpaid and Metro by T-Mobile customers on smartphone plans with mobile hotspot data the ability to add 10GB of Smartphone Mobile HotSpot each month (20GB total);•Working with our Lifeline partners to provide customers up to 5GB per month of free data;•Increasing the data allowance, at no extra charge, to schools and students using our EmpowerED digital learning program to ensure each participant had access to at least 20GB of data per month; and •Providing free international calling to landlines (and, in many cases, mobile numbers) to countries that were significantly impacted by the Pandemic through May 13, 2020.•In addition: •We are offering our customers creative, new COVID-safe solutions such as virtual selling and curbside pickup;•We partnered with multiple spectrum holders and the FCC to successfully deploy additional 600 MHz spectrum on a temporary basis (through June 30, 2020), effectively doubling total 600 MHz LTE capacity across the nation to help ensure customers can stay connected during this critical time; and•We are working to keep our network fully operational as an essential service to first responders, 911 communications and our customers and continue to expand our 5G network, while adhering to governmental guidelines.We continue to monitor the Pandemic and its impacts and may adjust our actions as needed to continue to provide our products and services to our communities and employees.Impact on Results of Operations and Performance Measures for the Year Ended December 31, 2020For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $458 million, before taxes, in supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related COVID-19 costs, which are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. These costs have been excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as they represent direct, incremental costs as a result of our response to the Pandemic. See “Adjusted EBITDA” in the “Performance Measures” section of this MD&A.Expected Continued Impact on Results of Operations and Performance MeasuresWe continue to monitor developments regarding the Pandemic and evaluate the appropriate steps needed to align with guidelines from state, local and federal government agencies and do what is best for our employees and customers. The extent to which the Pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous future developments that we are not able to predict at this time, including the duration and scope of the Pandemic, the success of governmental, business 33Table of Contentsand individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the Pandemic, and the impact on economic activity from the Pandemic and actions taken in response. Such impacts may include:•Lower net customer additions due to lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to temporary retail store closures and reduced consumer spending caused by widespread unemployment and other adverse economic effects, partially offset by lower churn;•Lower Equipment revenues and lower Cost of equipment sales from lower device sales due to lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to temporary retail store closures, which may impact our ability to sell devices; •Higher bad debt expense on our service and EIP receivable portfolios due to adverse macro-economic conditions. Should these adverse conditions worsen, our operating and financial results could be negatively impacted; •Continued costs to protect and support our employees and customers; and•Potential disruptions in our supply chains.In addition, we have reevaluated, and continue to assess, our spending, including for marketing purposes like advertising, capital projects like build-out of our stores, travel, third-party services and certain operating expenses. We have taken actions to adjust our spending given the significant uncertainty around the magnitude and duration of any recessionary impacts arising from the Pandemic. For additional risks to our business and industry, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.34Table of ContentsResults of OperationsSet forth below is a summary of our consolidated financial results:Year Ended December 312020 Versus 20192019 Versus 2018(in millions)202020192018$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeRevenuesPostpaid revenues$36,306 $22,673 $20,862 $13,633 60 %$1,811 9 %Prepaid revenues9,421 9,543 9,598 (122)(1)%(55)(1)%Wholesale revenues2,590 1,279 1,183 1,311 103 %96 8 %Roaming and other service revenues2,078 1,005 798 1,073 107 %207 26 %Total service revenues50,395 34,500 32,441 15,895 46 %2,059 6 %Equipment revenues17,312 9,840 10,009 7,472 76 %(169)(2)%Other revenues690 658 860 32 5 %(202)(23)%Total revenues68,397 44,998 43,310 23,399 52 %1,688 4 %Operating expensesCost of services, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below11,878 6,622 6,307 5,256 79 %315 5 %Cost of equipment sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below16,388 11,899 12,047 4,489 38 %(148)(1)%Selling, general and administrative18,926 14,139 13,161 4,787 34 %978 7 %Impairment expense418 — — 418 NM— NMDepreciation and amortization14,151 6,616 6,486 7,535 114 %130 2 %Total operating expenses61,761 39,276 38,001 22,485 57 %1,275 3 %Operating income6,636 5,722 5,309 914 16 %413 8 %Other income (expense)Interest expense(2,483)(727)(835)(1,756)242 %108 (13)%Interest expense to affiliates(247)(408)(522)161 (39)%114 (22)%Interest income29 24 19 5 21 %5 26 %Other expense, net(405)(8)(54)(397)4,963 %46 (85)%Total other expense, net(3,106)(1,119)(1,392)(1,987)178 %273 (20)%Income from continuing operations before income taxes3,530 4,603 3,917 (1,073)(23)%686 18 %Income tax expense(786)(1,135)(1,029)349 (31)%(106)10 %Income from continuing operations2,744 3,468 2,888 (724)(21)%580 20 %Income from discontinued operations, net of tax320 — — 320 NM— NMNet income$3,064 $3,468 $2,888 $(404)(12)%$580 20 %Statement of Cash Flows DataNet cash provided by operating activities$8,640 $6,824 $3,899 $1,816 27 %$2,925 75 %Net cash used in investing activities(12,715)(4,125)(579)(8,590)208 %(3,546)612 %Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities13,010 (2,374)(3,336)15,384 (648)%962 (29)%Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA24,557 13,383 12,398 11,174 83 %985 8 %Free Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps3,001 4,3193,552(1,318)(31)%76722 %NM - Not Meaningful35Table of ContentsThe following discussion and analysis is for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019 unless otherwise stated.

partially offset by•Lower commissions expense due to lower prepaid gross additions and compensation structure changes;•Higher bad debt expense, primarily due to customers acquired as a result of the Merger and the recording of estimated losses associated with the new credit loss standard, including incremental bad debt for the estimated macro-economic impacts of the Pandemic; and•Higher legal-related expenses from recording an estimated accrual associated with the FCC Notice of Apparent Liability and commitments associated with the Merger.•Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $458 million of supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related COVID-19 costs.Impairment expense was $418 million and consisted of the following:•A $218 million impairment on the goodwill in the Layer3 reporting unit; and•A $200 million impairment on the capitalized software development costs related to our postpaid billing system.•There was no impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2019.For more information regarding the impairments above, see Note 5 – Property and Equipment and Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.37Table of ContentsDepreciation and amortization increased $7.5 billion, or 114%, primarily as a result of the Merger, including:•Higher depreciation expense from assets acquired in the Merger, excluding leased devices, and network expansion from the continued build-out of our nationwide 5G network;•Higher depreciation expense on leased devices resulting from a higher total number of customer devices under lease, primarily from customers acquired in the Merger; and•Higher amortization from intangible assets acquired in the Merger.Operating income, the components of which are discussed above, increased $914 million, or 16%.Interest expense increased $1.8 billion, or 242%, primarily from:•The assumption of debt with a fair value of $31.8 billion in connection with the Merger;•The issuance of an aggregate of $19.0 billion in Senior Secured Notes and the entry into a $4.0 billion secured term loan in April 2020 in connection with the Merger;•Amortization of interest rate swap derivatives beginning upon settlement in April 2020; and•The issuance of an aggregate of $8.75 billion in Senior Secured Notes in October 2020.Interest expense to affiliates decreased $161 million, or 39%, primarily from the redemption of an aggregate of $5.25 billion in Senior Notes to affiliates and the repayment of an aggregate of $4.0 billion in Incremental term loan facility to affiliates in 2020, partially offset by lower capitalized interest.Other expense, net increased $397 million, primarily from losses on the extinguishment of debt.Income from continuing operations before income taxes, the components of which are discussed above, was $3.5 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Income tax expense decreased $349 million, or 31%, primarily from:•Lower income before income taxes; and•A lower effective tax rate, primarily due to changes in state income taxes and excess tax benefits, partially offset by an increase in non-deductible expenses, including certain Merger-related costs. The effective tax rate was 22.3% and 24.7% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Income from continuing operations decreased $724 million, or 21%, primarily from:•Higher Interest expense; and•Higher Other expense, net; partially offset by•Higher operating income; and•Lower Income tax expense.Income from discontinued operations, net of tax was $320 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and consists of the results of the Prepaid Business that was divested on July 1, 2020. There were no discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. For more information regarding the Prepaid Transaction, see Note 12 – Discontinued Operations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.38Table of ContentsNet income, the components of which are discussed above, decreased $404 million, or 12%, and included the following:•Merger-related costs, net of tax, of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $501 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.•The negative impact of supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related COVID-19 costs, net of tax, of $339 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to no impact for the year ended December 31, 2019.•Impairment expense of $366 million, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to no impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2019.Guarantor Financial InformationOn March 2, 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to the financial disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities, as well for affiliates whose securities collateralize a registrant’s securities. We early adopted the requirements of the amendments on January 1, 2020, which included replacing guarantor condensed consolidating financial information with summarized financial information for the consolidated obligor group (Parent, Issuer, and Guarantor Subsidiaries) and no longer requiring guarantor cash flow information, financial information for non-guarantor subsidiaries, or a reconciliation to the consolidated results.On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed certain registered debt to third parties issued by Sprint, Sprint Communications, Inc. and Sprint Capital Corporation (collectively, the “Sprint Issuers”). Amounts previously disclosed for the estimated values of certain acquired assets and liabilities assumed have been adjusted based on additional information arising subsequent to the initial valuation. These revisions to the estimated values did not have a significant impact on our summarized financial information for the consolidated obligor group.Pursuant to the applicable indentures and supplemental indentures, the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc. and the Sprint Issuers (collectively, the “Issuers”) is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile (“Parent”) and certain of Parent’s 100% owned subsidiaries (“Guarantor Subsidiaries”). The guarantees of the Guarantor Subsidiaries are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. The indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements governing the long-term debt contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers or borrowers and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to incur more debt, pay dividends and make distributions, make certain investments, repurchase stock, create liens or other encumbrances, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit agreements, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt restrict the ability of the Issuers or borrowers to loan funds or make payments to Parent. However, the Issuers or borrowers and Guarantor Subsidiaries are allowed to make certain permitted payments to Parent under the terms of the indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements.In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” The standard simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. We early adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and have applied the standard retrospectively to all periods presented. Upon the adoption of the standard, deferred tax assets of non-guarantor entities in aggregate of $163 million were reclassified and netted with the deferred tax liabilities of the guarantor obligor group of the debt issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.In March 2020, certain Guarantor Subsidiaries became non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.In connection with the preparation of our guarantor financial information for the year ended December 31, 2020, we determined that the summarized balance sheet information and summarized results of operations for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc., as presented in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020, should be adjusted to exclude investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries and the related equity method income from non-guarantor subsidiaries as of and for the year-to-date periods ending December 31, 2019, March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020. We also determined the summarized balance sheet information 39Table of Contentsand summarized results of operations for the consolidated obligor groups of debt issued by Sprint, Sprint Communications, Inc. and Sprint Capital Corporation, as presented in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020, should be adjusted as well to exclude investments in their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries for the year-to-date periods ending June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020. Therefore, we have updated the historical summarized financial information for these periods and obligor groups as set forth below. This adjustment does not impact the Consolidated Financial Statements for any quarterly or annual periods and does not impact guarantor financial information filed prior to our adoption of the new disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities on January 1, 2020.Basis of PresentationThe following tables include summarized financial information of the obligor groups of debt issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc., Sprint, Sprint Communications, Inc., and Sprint Capital Corporation. The summarized financial information of each obligor group is presented on a combined basis with balances and transactions within the obligor group eliminated. Investments in and the equity in earnings of non-guarantor subsidiaries which would otherwise be consolidated in accordance with U.S. GAAP are excluded from the below summarized financial information pursuant to SEC Regulation S-X Rule 13-01.The summarized balance sheet information for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc. is presented in the table below: (in millions)March 31, 2020June 30, 2020September 30, 2020December 31, 2020December 31, 2019Current assets$8,431 $23,105 $18,035 $22,638 $8,177 Noncurrent assets77,827 154,164 164,220 165,294 77,684 Current liabilities14,125 21,487 17,765 19,982 11,885 Noncurrent liabilities41,330 101,662 109,249 112,930 43,448 Due to non-guarantors— 7,054 7,183 7,433 — Due from non-guarantors358 — — — 346 Due to related parties14,215 6,067 4,846 4,873 14,173 Due from related parties26 24 19 22 20 The summarized results of operations information for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc. is presented in the table below: Three Months EndedMarch 31, 2020Six Months EndedJune 30, 2020Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2020Year Ended December 31, 2020Year Ended December 31, 2019(in millions)Total revenues$10,694 $28,071 $47,076 $67,112 $43,431 Operating income1,309 1,525 3,353 4,335 4,761 Net income809 412 1,029 1,148 2,860 Revenue from non-guarantors259 656 1,088 1,496 974 Operating expenses to non-guarantors129 775 1,443 2,127 668 Other expense to non-guarantors— (40)(77)(114)— The summarized balance sheet information for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by Sprint and Sprint Communications, Inc. is presented in the table below: (in millions)June 30, 2020September 30, 2020December 31, 2020Current assets$1,619 $1,051 $2,646 Noncurrent assets49,525 25,512 26,278 Current liabilities4,716 3,317 4,209 Noncurrent liabilities64,845 61,437 65,161 Due from non-guarantors49,254 25,231 25,993 Due to related parties6,025 4,774 4,786 Due from related parties— 5 — 40Table of ContentsThe summarized results of operations information for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by Sprint and Sprint Communications, Inc., since the acquisition of Sprint on April 1, 2020, is presented in the table below: Three Months EndedJune 30, 2020Six Months EndedSeptember 30, 2020Nine Months Ended December 31, 2020(in millions)Total revenues$2 $4 $10 Operating loss(15)(17)(15)Net loss(819)(1,651)(2,229)Revenue from non-guarantors2 4 6 Other income, net, from non-guarantors367 732 1,084 The summarized balance sheet information for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by Sprint Capital Corporation is presented in the table below: (in millions)June 30, 2020September 30, 2020December 31, 2020Current assets$1,619 $1,051 $2,646 Noncurrent assets58,547 34,540 35,330 Current liabilities4,788 3,388 4,281 Noncurrent liabilities70,070 66,530 70,253 Due from non-guarantors58,276 34,259 35,046 Due to related parties6,025 4,774 4,786 Due from related parties— 5 — The summarized results of operations information for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by Sprint Capital Corporation, since the acquisition of Sprint on April 1, 2020, is presented in the table below: Three Months EndedJune 30, 2020Six Months EndedSeptember 30, 2020Nine Months Ended December 31, 2020(in millions)Total revenues$2 $4 $10 Operating loss(15)(17)(15)Net loss(804)(1,608)(2,165)Revenue from non-guarantors2 4 6 Other income, net, from non-guarantors366 732 1,085 Performance MeasuresIn managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures. These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry on key operating and financial measures.The performance measures presented below include the impact of the Merger on a prospective basis from the close date of April 1, 2020. Historical results were not restated.CustomersA customer is generally defined as a SIM number with a unique T-Mobile identifier which is associated with an account that generates revenue. Customers are qualified either for postpaid service utilizing phones, wearables, DIGITS or other connected devices, which include tablets and SyncUp products, where they generally pay after receiving service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance of receiving service. Our postpaid customers include customers of T-Mobile. Our prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile. 41Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth the number of ending customers:As of December 31,2020 Versus 20192019 Versus 2018(in thousands)202020192018#%#%Customers, end of periodPostpaid phone customers (1)66,618 40,345 37,224 26,273 65 %3,121 8 %Postpaid other customers (1)14,732 6,689 5,295 8,043 120 %1,394 26 %Total postpaid customers81,350 47,034 42,519 34,316 73 %4,515 11 %Prepaid customers (1),(2)20,714 20,860 21,137 (146)(1)%(277)(1)%Total customers102,064 67,894 63,656 34,170 50 %4,238 7 %Adjustment to prepaid customers (2)— (616)— 616 (100)%(616)NMNM - Not Meaningful(1) Includes customers acquired in connection with the Merger and certain customer base adjustments. See Customer Base Adjustments and Net Customer Additions tables below.(2) On July 18, 2019, we entered into an agreement whereby certain T-Mobile prepaid products will now be offered and distributed by a current MVNO partner. As a result, we included a base adjustment in the third quarter of 2019 to reduce prepaid customers by 616,000. Total customers increased 34,170,000, or 50%, primarily from:•Higher postpaid phone customers, primarily due to customers acquired in the Merger and the success of new customer segments and rate plans and continued growth in existing and new markets, along with promotional activities; and•Higher postpaid other customers, primarily due to customers acquired in the Merger and growth in other connected devices primarily related to public and educational sector customers and wearable products; partially offset by•Lower prepaid customers, primarily due to the customer base adjustments made to align the customer reporting policies of T-Mobile and Sprint, partially offset by the continued success of our prepaid business due to promotional activities and rate plan offers.Customer Base AdjustmentsCertain adjustments were made to align the customer reporting policies of T-Mobile and Sprint.

Starting with the three months ended March 31, 2020, we discontinued reporting wholesale customers to focus on postpaid and prepaid customers and wholesale revenues, which we consider more relevant than the number of wholesale customers given the expansion of M2M and IoT products.(2) Prepaid customers with a device installment billing plan historically included as Sprint postpaid customers have been reclassified to prepaid customers to align with T-Mobile policy.(3) Customers associated with the Sprint wireless prepaid and Boost Mobile brands that were divested on July 1, 2020, have been excluded from our reported customers.(4) Customers who have rate plans with monthly recurring charges which are considered insignificant have been excluded from our reported customers.42Table of Contents(5) Customers with postpaid phone rate plans without a phone (e.g., non-phone devices) have been reclassified from postpaid phone to postpaid other customers to align with T-Mobile policy.(6) Certain Sprint customers subject to collection activity for an extended period of time have been excluded from our reported customers to align with T-Mobile policy.(7) Miscellaneous insignificant adjustments to align with T-Mobile policy.Net Customer AdditionsThe following table sets forth the number of net customer additions:Year Ended December 31,2020 Versus 20192019 Versus 2018(in thousands)202020192018#%#%Net customer additionsPostpaid phone customers 2,218 3,121 3,097 (903)(29)%24 1 %Postpaid other customers3,268 1,394 1,362 1,874 134 %32 2 %Total postpaid customers5,486 4,515 4,459 971 22 %56 1 %Prepaid customers (1)145 339 460 (194)(57)%(121)(26)%Total customers5,631 4,854 4,919 777 16 %(65)(1)%Acquired customers, net of base adjustments29,228 — — 29,228 NM— NMNM - Not Meaningful(1) On July 18, 2019, we entered into an agreement whereby certain T-Mobile prepaid products will now be offered and distributed by a current MVNO partner. As a result, we included a base adjustment in the third quarter of 2019 to reduce prepaid customers by 616,000. Total net customer additions increased 777,000, or 16%, primarily from:•Higher postpaid other net customer additions, primarily due to higher gross additions from connected devices, primarily due to public and educational sector additions and lower churn, partially offset by lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to retail store closures arising from the Pandemic; partially offset by•Lower postpaid phone net customer additions, primarily due to higher churn from customers acquired in the Merger and lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to retail store closures arising from the Pandemic; and•Lower prepaid gross customer additions, partially offset by lower churn, both primarily due to lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to retail store closures arising from the Pandemic. ChurnChurn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period. The number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored within a certain period of time. We believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty. The following table sets forth the churn: Year Ended December 31,Bps Change 2020 Versus 2019Bps Change 2019 Versus 2018202020192018Postpaid phone churn0.90 %0.89 %1.01 %1 bps-12 bpsPrepaid churn3.03 %3.82 %3.96 %-79 bps-14 bpsPostpaid phone churn was essentially flat, primarily due to the inclusion of the customer base acquired in the Merger with higher churn, offset by lower switching activity in the industry due to reduced store traffic due to temporary retail store closures arising from the Pandemic.Prepaid churn decreased 79 basis points, primarily due to lower switching activity in the industry due to reduced store traffic due to temporary retail store closures arising from the Pandemic and the continued success of our prepaid products due to promotional activities and rate plan offers.43Table of ContentsTotal Postpaid AccountsA postpaid account is generally defined as a billing account number that generates revenue.

We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. Postpaid phone ARPU excludes postpaid other customers and related revenues, which include wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices such as tablets and SyncUp products.44Table of ContentsThe following table illustrates the calculation of our operating measure ARPU and reconciles this measure to the related service revenues:(in millions, except average number of customers and ARPU)Year Ended December 31,2020 Versus 20192019 Versus 2018202020192018$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeCalculation of Postpaid Phone ARPUPostpaid service revenues$36,306 $22,673 $20,862 $13,633 60 %$1,811 9 %Less: Postpaid other revenues(2,367)(1,344)(1,117)(1,023)76 %(227)20 %Postpaid phone service revenues33,939 21,329 19,745 12,610 59 %1,584 8 %Divided by: Average number of postpaid phone customers (in thousands) and number of months in period59,249 38,602 35,458 20,647 53 %3,144 9 %Postpaid phone ARPU$47.74 $46.04 $46.40 $1.70 4 %$(0.36)(1)%Calculation of Prepaid ARPUPrepaid service revenues$9,421 $9,543 $9,598 $(122)(1)%$(55)(1)%Divided by: Average number of prepaid customers (in thousands) and number of months in period20,594 20,955 20,761 (361)(2)%194 1 %Prepaid ARPU$38.12 $37.95 $38.53 $0.17 — %$(0.58)(2)%Postpaid Phone ARPUPostpaid phone ARPU increased $1.70, or 4%, primarily due to:•The net impact of customers acquired in the Merger, which have higher ARPU (net of changes arising from the reduction in base due to policy adjustments and reclassification of certain ARPU components from the acquired customers being moved to other revenue lines); and•Higher premium service revenues; partially offset by•An increase in our promotional activities.Prepaid ARPUPrepaid ARPU was essentially flat and was primarily impacted by:•The impacts of certain adjustments to our customer base, including the removal of certain prepaid customers associated with products now offered and distributed by a current MVNO partner as those customers had lower ARPU; offset by•Dilution from promotional rate plans; and•A reduction in certain non-recurring charges.Average Revenue Per AccountAverage Revenue per Account (“ARPA”) represents the average monthly postpaid service revenue earned per account. We believe postpaid ARPA provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our postpaid service revenue realization and assist in forecasting our future postpaid service revenues on a per account basis. We consider postpaid ARPA to be indicative of our revenue growth potential given the increase in the average number of postpaid phone customers per account and increases in postpaid other customers, including wearables, DIGITS or other connected devices, which include tablets and SyncUp products.45Table of ContentsThe following table illustrates the calculation of our operating measure ARPA and reconciles this measure to the related service revenues:(in millions, except average number of accounts, ARPA)Year Ended December 31,2020 Versus 20192019 Versus 2018202020192018$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeCalculation of Postpaid ARPAPostpaid service revenues$36,306 $22,673 $20,862 $13,633 60 %$1,811 9 %Divided by: Average number of postpaid accounts (in thousands) and number of months in period22,959 14,486 13,492 8,473 58 %994 7 %Postpaid ARPA$131.78 $130.43 $128.86 $1.35 1 %$1.57 1 %Postpaid ARPAPostpaid ARPA increased $1.35, or 1%, primarily due to:•An increase in customers per account, including further penetration in connected devices, and the success of new customer segments and rate plans;•Higher premium service revenues; and•The net impact of customers acquired in the Merger; partially offset by•An increase in our promotional activities; and•A reduction in certain non-recurring charges, including from the impact of the Pandemic.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA represents earnings before Interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, non-cash Stock-based compensation and certain income and expenses not reflective of our ongoing operating performance. Net income margin represents Net income divided by Service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues.Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications services companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, Merger-related costs including network decommissioning costs, incremental costs directly attributable to COVID-19 and impairment expense, as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, as well as certain other nonrecurring income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).46Table of ContentsThe following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:Year Ended December 31,2020 Versus 20192019 Versus 2018(in millions)202020192018$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeNet income$3,064 $3,468 $2,888 $(404)(12)%$580 20 %Adjustments:Income from discontinued operations, net of tax(320)— — (320)NM— NMIncome from continuing operations2,744 3,468 2,888 (724)(21)%580 20 %Interest expense2,483 727 835 1,756 242 %(108)(13)%Interest expense to affiliates247 408 522 (161)(39)%(114)(22)%Interest income(29)(24)(19)(5)21 %(5)26 %Other expense, net405 8 54 397 4,963 %(46)(85)%Income tax expense786 1,135 1,029 (349)(31)%106 10 %Operating income6,636 5,722 5,309 914 16 %413 8 %Depreciation and amortization14,151 6,616 6,486 7,535 114 %130 2 %Operating income from discontinued operations (1)432 — — 432 NM— NMStock-based compensation (2)516 423 389 93 22 %34 9 %Merger-related costs1,915 620 196 1,295 209 %424 216 %COVID-19-related costs458 — — 458 NM— NMImpairment expense418 — — 418 NM— NMOther, net (3)31 2 18 29 1,450 %(16)(89)%Adjusted EBITDA$24,557 $13,383 $12,398 $11,174 83 %$985 8 %Net income margin (Net income divided by Service revenues)6 %10 %9 %-400 bps100 bpsAdjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues)49 %39 %38 %1,000 bps100 bpsNM - Not Meaningful(1)Following the Prepaid Transaction, starting on July 1, 2020, we provide MVNO services to DISH. We have included the operating income from discontinued operations from April 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020, in our determination of Adjusted EBITDA to reflect contributions of the Prepaid Business that were replaced by the MVNO Agreement beginning on July 1, 2020 in order to enable management, analysts and investors to better assess ongoing operating performance and trends.(2)Stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree to stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, certain stock-based compensation expenses associated with the Transactions have been included in Merger-related costs. (3)Other, net may not agree to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income primarily due to certain non-routine operating activities, such as other special items that would not be expected to reoccur or are not reflective of T-Mobile’s ongoing operating performance, and are therefore excluded in Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased $11.2 billion, or 83%. The components comprising Adjusted EBITDA are discussed further above. The increase was primarily due to:•Higher Total service revenues; and•Higher Equipment revenues; partially offset by•Higher Cost of services expenses, excluding Merger-related costs; •Higher Cost of equipment sales; and•Higher Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding Merger-related costs and supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related COVID-19 costs.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and common stock, financing leases, the sale of certain receivables, financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms and the New Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). In connection with the closing of the Merger on April 1, 2020, we incurred a substantial amount of additional third-party indebtedness which increased our future financial commitments, including aggregate interest payments. Further, the incurrence of additional indebtedness may inhibit our ability to incur new debt under the terms governing our existing and future indebtedness, which 47Table of Contentsmay make it more difficult for us to incur new debt in the future to finance our business strategy. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Indebtedness.”Cash FlowsThe following is a condensed schedule of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:Year Ended December 31,2020 Versus 20192019 Versus 2018(in millions)202020192018$%$%Net cash provided by operating activities$8,640 $6,824 $3,899 $1,816 27 %$2,925 75 %Net cash used in investing activities(12,715)(4,125)(579)(8,590)208 %(3,546)612 %Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities13,010 (2,374)(3,336)15,384 (648)%962 (29)%Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities increased $1.8 billion, or 27%, primarily from:•Higher Net income, excluding non-cash income and expenses; partially offset by•A $6.3 billion increase in net cash outflows from changes in working capital, primarily due to the one-time impact of $2.3 billion in gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps related to Merger financing for the year ended December 31, 2020, included in the use of cash from Other current and long-term liabilities, as well as higher use of cash from Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Inventories.•Net cash provided by operating activities includes $1.5 billion and $442 million in payments for Merger-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.•Net cash provided by operating activities includes $458 million in payments for supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related COVID-19 costs for the year ended December 31, 2020.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities increased $8.6 billion, or 208%. The use of cash was primarily from:•$11.0 billion in Purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, from network integration related to the Merger and the continued build-out of our nationwide 5G network; •$5.0 billion in cash paid for the acquisition of Sprint, net of cash and restricted cash acquired; and•$1.3 billion in Purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits; partially offset by •$3.1 billion in Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions; •$1.2 billion in Proceeds from the divestiture of prepaid business; and•$632 million related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements, for more information regarding these contracts, see Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased $15.4 billion. The source of cash was primarily from:•$35.3 billion in Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of discounts and issuance costs, driven primarily by the issuance of $31.8 billion in Senior Secured Notes and a draw of $4.0 billion on the New Secured Term Loan Facility; •$18.7 billion in Proceeds from the issuance of short-term debt, net of discounts and issuance costs, driven by a $19.0 billion draw on the New Secured Bridge Loan Facility in connection with the closing of the Merger; and•$304 million in net proceeds from the SoftBank Equity transaction, see Note 14 - SoftBank Equity Transaction of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements; partially offset by•$20.4 billion in Repayments of long-term debt driven by the repayment of $5.3 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes held by DT, our $4.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility with DT, our $4.0 billion New Secured Term Loan Facility, $2.3 billion of outstanding principal for the termination of the accounts receivable facility assumed in the Merger, $4.2 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes held by third parties and $656 million 48Table of Contentsaggregate principal amount of our 3.360% Senior Secured Series 2016-1 A-1 Notes due 2021; •$18.9 billion in Repayments of short-term debt, net of refunds for issuance costs, for the repayment of the $19.0 billion draw on the New Secured Bridge Loan Facility; and•$1.0 billion in Repayments of financing lease obligations.Cash and Cash EquivalentsAs of December 31, 2020, our Cash and cash equivalents were $10.4 billion compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2019.Free Cash FlowFree Cash Flow represents Net cash provided by operating activities less cash payments for Purchases of property and equipment, including Proceeds from sales of tower sites and Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions, less Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps, are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management, investors and analysts of our financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business.The table below provides reconciliations of Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps to Net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.Year Ended December 31,2020 Versus 20192019 Versus 2018(in millions)202020192018$%$ Change% ChangeNet cash provided by operating activities$8,640 $6,824 $3,899 $1,816 27 %$2,925 75 %Cash purchases of property and equipment(11,034)(6,391)(5,541)(4,643)73 %(850)15 %Proceeds from sales of tower sites— 38 — (38)(100)%38 NMProceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions3,134 3,876 5,406 (742)(19)%(1,530)(28)%Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs(82)(28)(212)(54)193 %184 (87)%Free Cash Flow658 4,319 3,552 (3,661)(85)%767 22 %Gross cash paid for the settlement of interest rate swaps2,343 — — 2,343 NM— NMFree Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps$3,001 $4,319 $3,552 $(1,318)(31)%$767 22 %NM - Not MeaningfulFree Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps related to Merger financing, decreased $1.3 billion, or 31%.

Under the financing arrangement, we can effectively extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain vendors. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding balances under such financing arrangement.We also maintain vendor financing arrangements primarily with our main network equipment suppliers. Under the respective agreements, we can obtain extended financing terms. Additionally, we assumed financial liabilities with certain vendors in connection with the closing of the Merger and incurred additional financial liabilities with DISH at the closing of the Prepaid Transaction. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repaid $481 million associated with the vendor financing arrangements and other financial liabilities, of which $342 million was associated with financial liabilities assumed in connection with the closing of the Merger. These payments are included in Repayments of short-term debt for purchases of inventory, property and equipment and other financial liabilities, in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the outstanding balance under the vendor financing arrangements and other financial liabilities was $240 million and $25 million, respectively.On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into a Credit Agreement with certain financial institutions named therein, providing for a $4.0 billion secured term loan facility (the “New Secured Term Loan Facility”) and a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility (the “New Revolving Credit Facility”). On September 16, 2020, we increased the aggregate commitment under the New Revolving Credit Facility to $5.5 billion through an amendment to the Credit Agreement. On October 9, 2020, we repaid at par all of the outstanding amounts under, and terminated, our New Secured Term Loan Facility. As of December 31, 2020, there was no outstanding balance under the New Revolving Credit Facility.On October 30, 2020, we entered into a $5.0 billion senior secured term loan commitment with certain financial institutions. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, on January 14, 2021, we issued an aggregate of $3.0 billion in Senior Notes. The senior secured term loan commitment was reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds of the Senior Notes, which reduced the commitment to $2.0 billion. Up to $2.0 billion of loans under the commitment may be drawn at any time (subject to customary conditions precedent) through June 30, 2021. If drawn, the facility matures in 364 days with one six-month extension exercisable at our discretion. Proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes and will accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25% per annum.Debt FinancingAs of December 31, 2020, our total debt and financing lease liabilities were $73.6 billion, excluding our tower obligations, of which $66.5 billion was classified as long-term debt and $1.4 billion was classified as long-term financing lease liabilities.During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued short- and long-term debt for net proceeds of $54.2 billion and redeemed and repaid short- and long-term debt with an aggregate principal amount of $39.9 billion. Additionally, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed certain indebtedness of Sprint totaling $31.8 billion.On October 6, 2020, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, issued an aggregate of $4.0 billion in Senior Secured Notes bearing interest rates ranging from 2.050% to 3.300% and maturing in 2028 through 2051. On October 9, 2020, we used the net proceeds of $4.0 billion to repay at par all of the outstanding amounts under, and terminate, our New Secured Term Loan Facility.On October 28, 2020, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, issued an aggregate of $4.75 billion in Senior Secured Notes bearing interest rates ranging from 2.250% to 3.600% and maturing in 2031 through 2060. We intend to use the net proceeds of $4.6 billion for general corporate purposes, which may include among other things, acquisitions of additional spectrum and refinancing existing indebtedness on an ongoing basis.50Table of ContentsOn October 30, 2020, we entered into a $5.0 billion senior secured term loan commitment with certain financial institutions. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, on January 14, 2021, T-Mobile USA issued $1.0 billion of 2.250% Senior Notes due 2026, $1.0 billion of 2.625% Senior Notes due 2029, and $1.0 billion of 2.875% Senior Notes due 2031. We intend to use the net proceeds of $3.0 billion for general corporate purposes, which may include among other things, financing acquisitions of additional spectrum and refinancing existing indebtedness on an ongoing basis. A portion of the senior secured term loan commitments were reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds of the Senior Notes, which reduced the commitment to $2.0 billion. Up to $2.0 billion of loans under the commitment may be drawn at any time (subject to customary conditions precedent) through June 30, 2021. If drawn, the facility matures in 364 days with one six-month extension exercisable at our discretion. Proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes and will accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25% per annum.For more information regarding our debt financing transactions, see Note 8 - Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Spectrum AuctionIn March 2020, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder of 2,384 licenses in Auction 103 (37/39 GHz and 47 GHz spectrum bands) for an aggregate price of $873 million, net of an incentive payment of $59 million. At the inception of Auction 103 in October 2019, we deposited $82 million with the FCC. Upon conclusion of Auction 103 in March 2020, we made a down payment of $93 million for the purchase price of the licenses won in the auction. On April 8, 2020, we paid the FCC the remaining $698 million of the purchase price for the licenses won in the auction. Prior to the Merger, the FCC announced that Sprint was the winning bidder of 127 licenses in Auction 103 (37/39 GHz and 47 GHz spectrum bands). All payments related to the licenses won were made by Sprint prior the Merger. For more information regarding our spectrum licenses, see Note 6 - Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Interest Rate Lock DerivativesIn April 2020, in connection with the issuance of an aggregate of $19.0 billion in Senior Secured Notes, we terminated our interest rate lock derivative. At the time of termination, the interest rate lock derivatives were a liability of $2.3 billion, of which $1.2 billion was cash collateralized. Consequently, the net cash required to settle the interest rate lock derivatives was an additional $1.1 billion and was paid at termination.For more information regarding the termination of our interest rate lock derivative, see Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Future Sources and Uses of LiquidityWe may seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2021, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other assets in private party transactions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. Excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions, or for other assets, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months as well as our longer-term liquidity needs. Our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of high yield callable debt and the execution of our integration plan. We determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. We have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses as a result of completing the Transactions, the Divestiture Transaction and compliance with the Government Commitments, and we are also expected to incur substantial restructuring expenses in connection with integrating and coordinating T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s businesses, operations, policies and procedures. While we have assumed that a certain level of Merger-related expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control, including required consultation and negotiation with certain counterparties, could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. These expenses could exceed the costs historically borne by us and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. There are a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including those due to the impact of the Pandemic, that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment. See “Risk Factors - Risk Related to our 51Table of ContentsBusiness and Wireless Industry - The Pandemic has adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our business, liquidity, financial condition, and operating results.” The indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding financing leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers or borrowers and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to incur more debt, pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock, make certain investments, repurchase stock, create liens or other encumbrances, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit agreements, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the Issuers or borrowers to loan funds or make payments to Parent. However, the Issuers or borrowers are allowed to make certain permitted payments to Parent under the terms of each of the credit agreements, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of December 31, 2020.The MergerIn connection with the closing of the Merger, on April 1, 2020, we assumed Sprint’s liabilities, which include accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term debt, operating and financing lease liabilities, net pension plan liabilities, deferred tax liabilities and long-term debt with an aggregate fair value of $31.8 billion.For more information regarding the Merger, see Note 2 – Business Combination of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Shentel Wireless Asset AcquisitionSprint PCS (specifically Sprint Spectrum L.P.) is party to a variety of publicly filed agreements with Shenandoah Personal Communications Company LLC (“Shentel”), pursuant to which Shentel is the exclusive provider of Sprint PCS’s wireless mobility communications network products in certain parts of Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Pursuant to one such agreement, the Sprint PCS Management Agreement, dated November 5, 1999 (as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time, the “Management Agreement”), Sprint PCS was granted an option to purchase Shentel’s wireless telecommunications assets used to provide services pursuant to the Management Agreement. On August 26, 2020, Sprint, now our indirect subsidiary, on behalf of and as the direct or indirect owner of Sprint PCS, exercised its option by delivering a binding notice of exercise to Shentel. T-Mobile’s exercise of its option triggered a requirement for the parties to engage three independent valuation providers (the “Valuation Providers”) to calculate the “entire business value” (the “Entire Business Value”) of such wireless telecommunications assets, pursuant to a formula and valuation process prescribed in the Management Agreement.Subsequent to December 31, 2020, on February 1, 2021, in accordance with the Management Agreement and other agreed-upon terms, the Valuation Providers determined and calculated the Entire Business Value of Shentel’s wireless telecommunications assets used to provide services pursuant to the Management Agreement to be $2.1 billion, and correspondingly, the base purchase price for such wireless telecommunications assets shall be ninety percent (90%) of that Entire Business Value amount ($1.9 billion), subject to certain other purchase price adjustments prescribed by the Management Agreement and such additional purchase price adjustments agreed by the parties. The parties are negotiating the remaining outstanding terms of a definitive agreement to govern the purchase of Shentel’s wireless telecommunication assets and expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2021 after satisfying customary conditions to closing.Financing Lease FacilitiesWe have entered into uncommitted financing lease facilities with certain partners that provide us with the ability to enter into financing leases for network equipment and services. As of December 31, 2020, we have committed to $5.1 billion of financing leases under these financing lease facilities, of which $1.2 billion was executed during the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect to enter into up to an additional $1.2 billion in financing lease commitments during the year ending December 31, 2021. Capital ExpendituresOur liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses, the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure and the integration of the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of T-Mobile and Sprint. Property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to the integration of our acquired Sprint 2.5 GHz spectrum licenses and existing 600 MHz spectrum licenses as we build out our 52Table of Contentsnationwide 5G network. We expect the majority of our remaining capital expenditures related to these efforts to occur in 2021 and 2022, after which we expect capital expenditure requirements to reduce.We expect cash purchases of property and equipment to range from $11.7 billion to $12.0 billion in 2021. For more information regarding our property and equipment and spectrum licenses, see Note 5 – Property and Equipment and Note 6 - Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively.DividendsWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our credit facilities and the indentures and supplemental indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding financing leases, contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock.Contractual ObligationsIn connection with the regulatory approvals of the Transactions, we made commitments to various state and federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice’s (the “DOJ”) and FCC. For more information regarding these commitments, see Note 18 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The contractual commitments and purchase obligations of Sprint were assumed upon the completion of the Merger. These contractual commitments and purchase obligations are primarily commitments to purchase wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business.For more information regarding our contractual commitments and purchase obligations, see Note 18- Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of December 31, 2020, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods:(in millions)Less Than 1 Year1 - 3 Years4 - 5 YearsMore Than 5 YearsTotalLong-term debt (1)$4,486 $11,960 $9,891 $43,052 $69,389 Interest on long-term debt3,477 5,938 4,317 13,817 27,549 Financing lease liabilities, including imputed interest1,121 1,217 229 61 2,628 Tower obligations (2)397 716 598 624 2,335 Operating lease liabilities, including imputed interest4,903 8,113 6,146 18,940 38,102 Purchase obligations (3)5,033 4,462 2,392 1,723 13,610 Spectrum leases and service credits (4)338 675 594 5,077 6,684 Total contractual obligations$19,755 $33,081 $24,167 $83,294 $160,297 (1)Represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premiums, discounts, debt issuance costs, consent fees, and financing lease obligations. See Note 8 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.(2)Future minimum payments, including principal and interest payments, related to the tower obligations. See Note 9 – Tower Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.(3)The minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contracts. Termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due as of the earliest we could exit the contract, typically in less than one year. For certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. This table does not include open purchase orders as of December 31, 2020 under normal business purposes. See Note 18 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.(4)Spectrum lease agreements are typically for five to 10 years with automatic renewal provisions, bringing the total term of the agreements up to 30 years.Certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. Other long-term liabilities have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the lack of historical trends to predict future payments. See Note 20 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.53Table of ContentsThe purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase spectrum licenses, wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we are contractually committed. Where we are committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether we take delivery, we have included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. The acquisition of spectrum licenses is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.Related Party Transactions SoftBankOn February 20, 2020, T-Mobile, SoftBank and DT entered into a Letter Agreement as described in Note 2 - Business Combination. The Letter Agreement requires T-Mobile to issue to SoftBank 48,751,557 shares of T-Mobile common stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Letter Agreement, for no additional consideration, if certain conditions are met.On June 22, 2020, we entered into a Master Framework Agreement and related transactions with SoftBank to facilitate the SoftBank Monetization as described in Note 14 - SoftBank Equity Transaction of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2020, DT and SoftBank held, directly or indirectly, approximately 43.4% and 8.6%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock, with the remaining approximately 48.0% of our outstanding common stock held by other stockholders.

Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2020, that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with either DT or SoftBank. We have relied upon DT and SoftBank for information regarding their respective activities, transactions and dealings.DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: Irancell Telecommunications Services Company, Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, provided basic telecommunications services to three customers in Germany identified on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List maintained by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control: Bank Melli, Bank Sepah, and Europäisch-Iranische Handelsbank. These services have been terminated or are in the process of being terminated. For the year ended December 31, 2020, gross revenues of all DT affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic and telecommunications services with the Iranian parties identified herein were less than $0.1 million, and the estimated net profits were less than $0.1 million.In addition, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate a fixed-line network in their respective European home countries (in particular Germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the Embassy of Iran in those European countries. Gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were less than $0.1 million. We understand that DT intends to continue these activities.Separately, SoftBank, through one of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, provides roaming services in Iran through Irancell Telecommunications Services Company. During the nine months from the acquisition of Sprint on April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, SoftBank had no gross revenues from such services and no net profit was generated. We understand that the SoftBank subsidiary intends to continue such services. This subsidiary also provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to accounts affiliated with the Embassy of Iran in Japan. During the nine months from the acquisition of Sprint on April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, SoftBank estimates that gross revenues and net profit generated by such services were both under $0.1 million. We understand that the SoftBank subsidiary is obligated under contract and intends to continue such services.In addition, SoftBank, through one of its non-U.S. indirect subsidiaries, provides office supplies to the Embassy of Iran in Japan. SoftBank estimates that gross revenue and net profit generated by such services during the nine months from the acquisition of Sprint on April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, were both under $0.1 million. We understand that the SoftBank subsidiary intends to continue such activities.55Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have arrangements, as amended from time to time, to sell certain EIP accounts receivable and service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as a source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, we derecognized net receivables of $2.5 billion upon sale through these arrangements. For more information regarding these off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 4 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition as they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Three of these policies, discussed below, are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies.DepreciationOur property and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. We record property and equipment at cost, and we generally depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. If all other factors were to remain unchanged, we expect that a one-year increase in the useful lives of our in-service property and equipment, exclusive of leased devices, would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $2.9 billion in our 2020 depreciation expense and that a one-year decrease in the useful life would have resulted in an increase of approximately $3.5 billion in our 2020 depreciation expense.See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 – Property and Equipment of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management’s underlying estimates of useful lives.Evaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for ImpairmentGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, are not amortized but tested for potential impairment annually, as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired.We test goodwill on a reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its book value. If the fair value exceeds the book value, then no impairment is measured. We have identified two reporting units for which discrete financial information is available and results are regularly reviewed by management: wireless and Layer3. The Layer3 reporting unit consists of the assets and liabilities of Layer3 TV, Inc., which was acquired in January 2018. The services provided by the Layer3 reporting unit are branded TVisionTM. The wireless reporting unit consists of the remaining assets and liabilities of T-Mobile US, Inc., excluding Layer3 TV, Inc. We separately evaluate these reporting units for impairment.When assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We employed a qualitative approach to assess the wireless reporting unit. The fair value of the wireless reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. We recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. In the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. We believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying 56Table of Contentsaggregate fair value. No events or change in circumstances have occurred that indicate the fair value of the wireless reporting unit may be below its carrying amount at December 31, 2020.Concurrent with the consummation of the Merger, management also revisited the plans for our TVisionTM services offering and the integration of this offering with the Sprint customer base. Additionally, we expect our significantly enhanced spectrum position following the Merger will allow us to accelerate our in-home broadband internet service strategy. The enhanced in-home broadband opportunity, along with the acquisition of certain content rights, created a strategic shift in our TVisionTM services offering allowing us the ability to develop a video product which will be complementary to the in-home broadband offering. Based on these events and changes in circumstances, we determined that recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill for the Layer3 reporting unit should be evaluated for impairment. We employed a quantitative approach to assess the Layer3 reporting unit. The fair value of the Layer3 reporting unit was determined using an income approach, which was based on estimated discounted future cash flows.We made estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates to determine the reporting unit’s estimated fair value. The key assumptions used were as follows:•Expected cash flows underlying the TVisionTM business plan for the periods 2020 through 2025, which took into account assumptions for a delayed launch, estimates of subscribers for TVisionTM services, average revenue and content cost per subscriber, operating costs and capital expenditures; •Cash flows beyond 2025 were projected to grow at a long-term growth rate estimated at 3%. Estimating a long-term growth rate requires significant judgment about future business strategies as well as micro- and macro-economic environments that are inherently uncertain; and•We used a discount rate of 30% to risk adjust the cash flow projections in determining the estimated fair value.The carrying value of the Layer3 reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value as of June 30, 2020. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment loss of $218 million, which is included in Impairment expense in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. This impairment reduced the goodwill assigned to the Layer3 reporting unit to zero. We test spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with our management of the overall business at anational level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitativeassessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. If the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. We estimate fair value using the Greenfield methodology, which is an income approach, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The Greenfield methodology values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses) and makes investments required to build an operation comparable to current use. The value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. We base the assumptions underlying the Greenfield methodology on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. Future cash flows in the Greenfield methodology are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, EBITDA margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.The valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrumlicenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. If actual results or futureexpectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges ongoodwill or spectrum licenses. The most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues,EBITDA margins, capital expenditures and long-term growth rate.For more information regarding our impairment assessments, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.57Table of ContentsIncome TaxesDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available.We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedFor information regarding recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to economic risks in the normal course of business, primarily from changes in interest rates, including changes in investment yields and changes in spreads due to credit risk and other factors. These risks, along with other business risks, impact our cost of capital. Our policy is to manage exposure related to fluctuations in interest rates in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term. We have established interest rate risk limits that are closely monitored by measuring interest rate sensitivities of our debt portfolio. We do not foresee significant changes in the strategies used to manage market risk in the near future.Certain potential sources of financing available to us, including our senior secured term loan commitment with certain financial institutions and New Revolving Credit Facility, bear interest that is indexed to LIBOR plus a fixed margin. As of December 31, 2020, we did not have outstanding balances under these facilities.

Our fixed wireless High Speed Internet provides a real alternative to traditional landline internet service providers and expands access to many people who have historically had only one choice or no access to traditional home broadband. With our High Speed Internet plan, customers can access the internet without worrying about annual service contracts, data overages, startup costs or hidden fees. We also provide products and services that are complementary to our wireless communications services, including device protection and wireline communication services to domestic and international customers.CustomersWe provide wireless communications services to two primary categories of customers: •Postpaid customers generally include customers who are qualified to pay after receiving wireless communications services utilizing phones, High Speed Internet, wearables, DIGITS (a service that allows our customers to use multiple mobile numbers on any compatible smartphone, wearable or other device with internet connection) or other connected devices, which include tablets and SyncUp products; and•Prepaid customers generally include customers who pay for wireless communications services in advance. Our prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile.We provide Machine-to-Machine (“M2M”) and Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) customers access to our network. This access and the customer relationship is managed by wholesale partners. We generate the majority of our service revenues by providing wireless communications services to postpaid and prepaid customers. Our ability to attract and retain postpaid and prepaid customers is important to our business in the generation of service revenues, equipment revenues and other revenues. In 2021, our service revenues generated by providing wireless communications services by customer category were:•73% Postpaid customers;•17% Prepaid customers; and •10% Wholesale and other services.Substantially all of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were earned in the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Network StrategyUtilizing our multi-layer spectrum portfolio, our mission is to be “Famous for Network.” We have deployed low-band and mid-band spectrum dedicated for 5G across our dense and broad network to create America’s largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network. Our Merger with Sprint greatly enhanced our spectrum position. Integration of the spectrum and network assets acquired in the Merger is expected to occur through 2023. The integration strategy includes deploying the acquired spectrum on the combined network assets to supplement capacity, migrating Sprint customers to our network and optimizing the combined assets by decommissioning redundant sites to realize synergies.6Table of ContentsSpectrum PositionWe provide wireless communications services utilizing mid-band spectrum licenses, such as AWS, PCS and 2.5 GHz, low-band spectrum licenses utilizing our 600 MHz, 700 MHz and 800 MHz spectrum and mmWave spectrum.•We controlled an average of 357 MHz of combined low- and mid-band spectrum nationwide as of December 31, 2021. This spectrum is comprised of:•An average of 40 MHz in the 600 MHz band;•An average of 10 MHz in the 700 MHz band;•An average of 14 MHz in the 800 MHz band;•An average of 41 MHz in the 1700 MHz AWS band;•An average of 66 MHz in the 1900 MHz PCS band;•An average of 159 MHz in the 2.5 GHz band; and•An average of 27 MHz in the C-band.•We controlled an average of 1,157 GHz of combined millimeter spectrum licenses.•In March 2021, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder of 142 licenses in Auction 107 (“C-band spectrum”) for an aggregate purchase price of $9.3 billion. The licenses acquired include an average of 40 MHz across the top markets and an average of 27 MHz nationwide. We expect to incur an additional $1.0 billion in relocation costs associated with the C-band spectrum acquired, which will be paid through 2024.•In January 2022, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder of 199 licenses in Auction 110 (mid-band spectrum) for an aggregate purchase price of $2.9 billion. Subsequent to Auction 110, we will control an average of 12 MHz in the 3.45 GHz band nationwide.•We plan to evaluate future spectrum purchases in current and upcoming auctions and in the secondary market to further augment our current spectrum position.•As of December 31, 2021, we had equipment deployed on approximately 102,000 macro cell sites and 41,000 small cell/distributed antenna system sites across our network. 5G LeadershipOur 5G network is America’s largest, fastest and most reliable:•As of December 31, 2021, our Ultra Capacity 5G covers 210 million people and can deliver speeds of 400 Mbps or more.•As of December 31, 2021, our Extended Range 5G covers 310 million people, reaching 94% of Americans.CompetitionThe wireless communications services industry is highly competitive. We are the second largest provider of wireless communications services in the U.S. as measured by our total postpaid and prepaid customers. Our competitors include other national carriers, such as AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”) and Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”). In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller regional carriers, MVNOs, including Comcast Corporation, Charter Communications, Inc., Altice USA, Inc. and DISH, many of which offer no-contract, postpaid and prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice, messaging and data services, using alternative technologies or services. Competitive factors within the wireless communications services industry include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies and regulatory changes. Some competitors have shown a willingness to use aggressive pricing or offering bundled services as a source of differentiation. Other competitors have sought to add ancillary services, like mobile video or music streaming services, to enhance their offerings. Taken together, the competitive factors we face continue to put pressure on growth and margins as companies compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customers.7Table of ContentsHuman CapitalEmployeesAs of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 75,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions.Attraction and RetentionWe employ a highly skilled workforce within a broad range of functions. Substantially all of our employees are located throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico, to serve our nationwide network and retail operations. Our headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington and Overland Park, Kansas.We attract and retain our workforce through a dynamic and inclusive culture and by providing exceptional benefits, including:•Competitive medical, dental and vision benefits;•Annual stock grants to all full-time and part-time employees and a discounted Employee Stock Purchase Program;•A 401(k) Savings Plan;•Nationwide minimum pay of at least $20 per hour to all full-time and part-time employees;•LiveMagenta: a custom-branded program for employee engagement and well-being, including free access to life coaches, financial coaches and tools for healthy living;•Access to personal health advocates offering independent guidance;•Tuition assistance for all full-time and part-time employees; and•A matching program for employee donations and volunteering.Training and DevelopmentWe believe in providing opportunities for our employees to improve their skills and advance their careers.

Our Equity in Action Plan is a five-year plan that spans the values we live by, how we invest in and provide opportunities for our employees, how we select the suppliers we do business with and how we advocate for our communities.For our employees, we have established six DE&I Employee Resource Groups and four sub-affinity groups that have helped us establish and maintain a culture of inclusion. Currently, we have over 50 DE&I chapters across the nation that help spearhead volunteer opportunities, events and meaningful conversation with employees at a local level. Our DE&I networks include the following:•Accessibility Community at T-Mobile;•Multicultural Alliance;◦Asia Pacific & Allies Network;◦Black Empowerment Network;◦Indigenous Peoples Network;8Table of Contents◦Magenta Latinx Network;•Multigenerational Network;•Pride;•Veterans & Allies Network; and•Women & Allies Network. We have established an External Diversity and Inclusion Council in connection with our civil rights memorandum of understanding. The council includes civil rights leaders representing a wide-range of underrepresented communities. Together with T-Mobile, the council will help identify ways to improve our efforts in focus areas such as corporate governance, workforce recruitment and retention, procurement, entrepreneurship, philanthropy and community investment.Environmental SustainabilityReducing Carbon FootprintWe are working to do our part to combat climate change and preserve the environment by setting carbon reduction goals that are aligned with science and investing in renewable energy. We are reducing our carbon footprint through several initiatives, including:•Setting science-based targets to reduce our Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions;•Investing in renewable energy, as evidenced by our RE100 pledge, a global initiative that unites businesses committed to 100% renewable energy. We met this goal in 2021 through credits and our engagement in Virtual Power Purchasing Agreements (VPPAs) and a Green Direct tariff agreement with nine clean energy providers for expected annual provision of approximately 3.4 million megawatt hours of renewable energy; •Continuously testing and evaluating new, efficient equipment for our facilities, including switch stations, cell sites, retail stores and customer experience centers to reduce energy consumption; and•Promoting the circular economy through our device reuse and recycle program, which collects millions of devices for reuse, resale, and recycling annually.Responsible SourcingWe believe our suppliers are a valuable extension of our business and corporate values. Our Supplier Code of Conduct outlines expectations around ethical business practices for our suppliers. We require our suppliers to operate in full compliance with laws, rules, regulations and ethical standards of the country in which they operate or provide products or services. We expect our suppliers to share our commitment to ethical conduct and environmentally responsible business practices while they conduct business with or on behalf of us.We employ a third-party risk management (“TPRM”) process to screen for anti-corruption, global sanctions, human rights and environmental risks before engaging with a supplier. Our TPRM process also continuously monitors current suppliers for policy violations and risks.As DE&I is instrumental to our culture and values, we are on a mission to create fair and equitable opportunities for all suppliers, including veteran or service-disabled veteran-owned, disability-owned, woman-owned, minority-owned, LGBT-owned and small and disadvantaged businesses.RegulationThe FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The FCC has a number of complex requirements that affect our operations and pending proceedings regarding additional or modified requirements that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or operating 9Table of Contentsresults. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly. Except for operations in certain unlicensed frequency bands, wireless communications services providers generally must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10-15 years depending on the particular licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such noncompliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the FCC retains the right to modify rules related to use of licensed spectrum, which could impact T-Mobile’s ability to provide services.Additionally, Congress’s and the FCC’s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (“CMRS”), which includes cellular, PCS and other wireless services, could significantly increase and intensify competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses or our competitive position in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers’ spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers. Congress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership through an entity controlling the licensee. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest, but must be reviewed and approved. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our Company by DT.For our Educational Broadband Service (“EBS”) licenses in the 2.5 GHz band, FCC rules previously limited eligibility to hold EBS licenses to accredited educational institutions and certain governmental, religious and nonprofit entities, while permitting those license holders to lease up to 95% of their capacity for non-educational purposes. Therefore, we primarily access EBS spectrum through long-term leasing arrangements with EBS license holders. Our EBS spectrum leases typically have an initial term equal to the remaining term of the EBS license, with an option to renew the lease for additional terms, for a total lease term of up to 30 years. On April 27, 2020, the FCC lifted the restriction on who can hold EBS licenses and the 30-year limitation on lease duration, among other changes. T-Mobile has started to acquire some of these EBS licenses but we continue to lease most of our spectrum in this band and expect that to be the case for some time. The elimination of these restrictions will allow and may encourage current license holders to sell their licenses to other parties, including to T-Mobile. While a majority of our leases have contractual provisions enabling us to match offers, we may be forced to compete with others to purchase 2.5 GHz licenses on the secondary market and expend additional capital earlier than we may have anticipated.While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communications services providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of devices while driving, service mapping, protection of consumer information, zoning and land use. Notwithstanding this federal preemption, in response to the Pandemic, several state legislatures are considering bills or have passed laws that could potentially set prices, minimum performance standards, and/or restrictions on service discontinuation that could impact our business in those states.In addition, following the FCC’s adoption of the 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom (“RIF”) Order reclassifying broadband internet access services as Title I (non-common carrier services), a number of states have sought to impose state-specific net neutrality and privacy requirements on providers’ broadband services. The FCC’s RIF Order preempted such state efforts, which are inconsistent with the FCC’s federal deregulatory approach. Recently, however, the DC Circuit issued a ruling largely upholding the RIF Order, but also vacating the portion of the ruling broadly preempting state/local net neutrality laws. The court left open the prospect that particular state laws could still unlawfully conflict with the FCC net neutrality rules and be preempted; court challenges to some state enactments are pending.10Table of ContentsWhile most states are largely seeking to codify the repealed federal rules, there are differences in some states, notably California, which has passed separate privacy and net neutrality legislation, and Colorado and Virginia, which have passed privacy laws. There are also efforts within Congress to pass federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirements, while also ensuring the preemption of separate state requirements, including the California laws. If not preempted or rescinded, separate state requirements will impose significant business costs and could also result in increased litigation costs and enforcement risks. State authority over wireless broadband services will remain unsettled until final action by the courts or Congress.In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other federal agencies have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are to some extent unknown, and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.

Risk Factors In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully inevaluating T-Mobile. Our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results, as well as the price of our common stock and other securities, could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Risks related to the Pandemic The Pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and operating results. The Pandemic has impacted the ways in which our customers use their devices, where and how we work, and our suppliers and vendors’ ability to provide products to us. As a result, our business, liquidity, financial condition, and operating results may continue to be adversely impacted by the Pandemic. Current and future Pandemic-related restrictions on, or disruptions of, transportation networks and supply chain shortages could impact our ability to acquire handsets or other end user devices in amounts sufficient to meet customer demand and to obtain the equipment required to meet our current and future network buildout plans, either of which could materially adversely affect us. The extent to which the Pandemic may impact our future operational and financial performance remains uncertain and is subject to many factors outside of our control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the Pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the continued development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures and the impact of the Pandemic on the economy and consumer demand. Potential negative impacts of these external factors include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for our products and services; our supply chain and sales and distribution channels; collectability of customer accounts; our ability to execute strategic plans; and our profitability and cost structure. To the extent the Pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this “Risk Factors” section.11Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our Business and the Wireless IndustryCompetition, industry consolidation, and changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We have multiple competitors that possess either more or different access to wireless assets, and yet we compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings, price, network coverage, speed and quality, and customer service. We expect the wireless industry’s customer growth rate to moderate in comparison with historical growth rates, leading to ongoing competition for customers. We also expect that our customers’ appetite for data services will place increasing demands on our network capacity. This competition and our capacity will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for a relatively fixed pool of customers with an ever-expanding variety of products and services. Our ability to compete will depend upon, among other things, continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality and customer service, effective marketing and selling of products and services, innovation, and attractive pricing, all of which will involve significant expenses.We face increased competition from other service providers, including from cable, wireline and satellite providers, as industry sectors converge. Cable companies such as Comcast, Charter, and Altice are diversifying outside cable, voice and broadband services to also offer wireless services. Wireline companies, such as Frontier and Windstream have announced plans for fiber buildouts, often supported by government funding, which may impact our fixed wireless High Speed Internet growth plans. We expect DISH, which has already acquired several MVNOs, to meet their government commitments and build a wireless network and offer competitive postpaid and prepaid wireless service plans. Verizon and AT&T have refocused on connectivity services, including fiber builds and deployment of next generation wireless technology, and we expect both companies to increase competitive pressure, including expanding partnerships and offerings. These factors could make it more difficult for us to continue to attract and retain customers, adversely affecting our competitive position and ability to grow, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We have seen, and continue to expect, additional joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances in the converged connectivity sector, which could result in larger competitors competing for a limited number of customers. Further consolidation could negatively impact our businesses, including wholesale. For example, we will experience declining revenues from our wholesale business as Verizon migrates legacy TracFone customers off the T-Mobile network and DISH migrates Boost customers to either their standalone network or AT&T. Our competitors may also enter into exclusive handset, device, or content arrangements, execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaigns, or otherwise improve their cost position relative to ours. In addition, refusal of our competitors and partners to provide critical access to resources and inputs, such as roaming and/or backhaul services, on reasonable terms could negatively impact our business.We have recently experienced a criminal cyberattack and could in the future be further harmed by disruption, data loss or other security breaches, whether directly or indirectly through third parties. Our business involves the receipt, storage and transmission of our customers’ confidential information, including sensitive personal information and payment card information, confidential information about our employees and suppliers, and other sensitive information about our Company, such as our business plans, transactions and intellectual property (collectively, “Confidential Information”). Unauthorized access to Confidential Information is difficult to anticipate, detect or prevent, particularly given that the methods used by third parties to gain unauthorized access constantly change and evolve. We and our third-party service and equipment providers are subject to attacks and threats to our and their IT networks, systems and supply chain, including attacks and threats by state-sponsored parties, malicious actors, employees or third parties, who may exploit bugs, errors, misconfigurations or other vulnerabilities or engage in social engineering to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of Confidential Information or cause serious operational disruptions (e.g., ransomware). As a telecommunications carrier, we are considered a critical infrastructure provider and therefore are a persistent target of cyberattacks. In addition, the Pandemic has presented additional operational and cybersecurity risks to our IT systems due to work-from-home arrangements at the Company and our third-party service and equipment providers. Attacks against companies like ours are perpetrated by a variety of groups and persons, including those in jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are ineffective or unavailable, and such attacks may even be perpetrated by or at the behest of foreign governments.In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third-party service and equipment providers as part of our business operations. These third-party service and equipment providers have experienced in the past and will likely continue to experience data breaches and other attacks that involve unauthorized access to Confidential Information and create operational disruptions, and they face security challenges common to all parties that collect and process information.12Table of ContentsIn August 2021, we disclosed that our systems were subject to a criminal cyberattack that compromised certain data of millions of our current customers, former customers, and prospective customers, including, in some instances, social security numbers, names, addresses, dates of birth and driver’s license/identification numbers. With the assistance of outside cybersecurity experts, we located and closed the unauthorized access to our systems and identified current, former and prospective customers whose information was impacted and notified them, consistent with state and federal requirements. We have incurred certain cyberattack-related expenses and expect to continue to incur additional expenses in future periods, including costs to remediate the attack, provide additional customer support and enhance customer protection. For more information, see “Cyberattack” in the Overview section of MD&A. As a result of the August 2021 cyberattack, we are subject to numerous lawsuits and regulatory inquiries, the ongoing costs of which may be material, and we may be subject to further regulatory inquiries and private litigation. For more information, see “– Contingencies and Litigation – Litigation and Regulatory Matters” in Note 17 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and “– Unfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results” below. As a result of the August 2021 cyberattack or other cyberattacks or security breaches involving our Company or our third-party service and equipment providers, we may incur significant costs or experience other material financial impacts, which may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, our cyber insurance, and such costs and impacts may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.In addition to the August 2021 cyberattack, we have experienced other unrelated immaterial incidents involving unauthorized access to certain Confidential Information, and we expect to experience cyberattacks and other cybersecurity incidents in the future. Typically, these incidents have involved attempts to commit fraud by taking control of a customer’s phone line. In other cases, the incidents have also involved unauthorized access to certain of our customers’ private information, including credit card information, financial data, social security numbers or passwords. We have also experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyberattacks and other incidents involving our supply chain and in relation to third-party products and services (including cloud services) that are used in our IT environment and business.Our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to information and to defend against attacks seeking to disrupt our services must be continually evaluated and enhanced to address the ever-evolving threat landscape and changing cybersecurity regulations, which could require the investment of significant resources. We cannot make assurances that all preventive actions taken will adequately repel a significant attack or prevent or substantially mitigate the impacts of security breaches or misuses of data, unauthorized access by third parties or employees or exploits against third-party supplier environments, or that we or our third-party service and equipment providers will be able to effectively identify, investigate or remediate such incidents in a timely manner or at all. We expect to continue to be the target of cyberattacks, data breaches or security incidents, given the nature of our business, and we expect the same with respect to our third-party service and equipment providers. Any future cyberattacks, data breaches, or security incidents may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results. If we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy. Significant technological changes continue to impact our industry. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to changes in available technology, continually invest in our network, increase network capacity, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings to address our current and potential customers’ changing demands. Enhancing our network, including the ongoing deployment of our 5G network, is subject to risks related to equipment changes and the migration of customers from older technologies. Negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, the perceived health risks relating to 5G networks could undermine market acceptance of our 5G services. Adopting new and sophisticated technologies may result in implementation issues, such as scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints, regulatory permitting issues, customer dissatisfaction, and other issues that could cause delays in launching new technological capabilities, which in turn could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the upgrades. If our new services fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with these services are higher than anticipated, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, brand, financial condition and operating results.We rely on highly skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders is extremely competitive. This competition has become exacerbated by the increase in employee resignations currently taking place throughout the United States as a result of the Pandemic. We believe our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented personnel for 13Table of Contentsall areas of our organization, including our CEO and the other members of our senior leadership team. Doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, changes to U.S. immigration policy, competitors’ hiring practices, employee tolerance for the significant amount of change within and demands on our Company and our industry, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Further, our vaccination and return to office protocols during the Pandemic may also impact the recruitment and retention of employees. If key employees depart or we are unable to recruit successfully, our business could be negatively impacted.In addition, certain members of our senior leadership team, including our CEO have term employment agreements with us. Our inability to extend the terms of these employment agreements or to replace these members of our senior leadership team at the end of their terms with qualified and capable successors could hinder our strategic planning and execution.In addition, the continued integration of T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s businesses and culture could have an adverse impact on our employees. This integration may impact our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, as existing and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us. If key employees depart, our business could be negatively impacted. We may incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and replacing departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent. As a result, we may not be able to meet our business plan, and our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.System failures and business disruptions may prevent us from providing reliable service, which could materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition. We rely upon systems and networks - those of third-party suppliers and other providers, in addition to our own - to provide and support our services. System, network or infrastructure failures may prevent us from providing reliable service. Examples of these risks include:•physical damage, power surges or outages, or equipment failure with respect to both our wireless and wireline networks, including those as a result of severe weather and natural disasters, which may occur more frequently or with greater intensity as a result of global climate change, public health crises, terrorist attacks, political instability and volatility and acts of war;•human error, such as responding to deceptive communications or unintentionally executing malicious code;•unauthorized access to our IT and business systems or to our network and critical infrastructure and those of our suppliers and other providers;•supplier failures or delays; and•system failures or outages of our business systems or communications network.Such events could cause us to lose customers and revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational damage, and subject us to fines, penalties, adverse actions or judgments, litigation or governmental investigations. Remediation costs could include liability for information loss, costs of repairing infrastructure and systems, and/or costs of incentives offered to customers. Our insurance may not cover, or be adequate to fully reimburse us for, costs and losses associated with such events.The scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum, and regulations relating to spectrum use, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We continue to deploy spectrum to expand and deepen our coverage, particularly 5G coverage, maintain our quality of service, meet increasing customer demands, and deploy new technologies. However, as we continue to expand and differentiate from our competitors, we may acquire additional spectrum in the future. As a result, we will continue to actively seek to make additional investment in spectrum, which could be significant.The continued interest in, and acquisition of, spectrum by existing carriers and others, including speculators, may reduce our ability to acquire and/or increase the cost of acquiring spectrum in the secondary market, including leasing or purchasing additional spectrum in the 2.5 GHz band, or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other means, including government auctions. Additionally, increased interest from third parties in acquiring spectrum may make it difficult to renew leases of some of our existing 2.5 GHz spectrum holdings in the future. Additionally, the FCC may not be able to provide sufficient additional spectrum to auction or we may be unable to secure the spectrum necessary to maintain or enhance our competitive position in any auction we may elect to participate in or in the secondary market, on favorable terms or at all. Any return on our investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customers and to provide additional services and usage to existing customers.14Table of ContentsThe FCC, or other government entities, may impose conditions on the acquisition and use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas. If we cannot acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise, if competitors acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide services competitive with our services, or if we cannot deploy services over acquired spectrum on a timely basis without burdensome conditions, at reasonable cost, and while maintaining network quality levels, our ability to attract and retain customers and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.The challenges in satisfying the large number of Government Commitments in the required time frames and the significant cumulative cost incurred in tracking, monitoring and complying with them could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In connection with the regulatory proceedings and approvals required to close the Transactions, we agreed to various Government Commitments. These Government Commitments include, among other things, extensive 5G network build-out commitments, obligations to deliver high-speed wireless services to the vast majority of Americans, and marketing an in-home fixed wireless product to households where spectrum capacity is sufficient. Other Government Commitments relate to national security, pricing and availability of rate plans, employment, substantial monetary contributions to support organizations, and implementation of diversity and inclusion initiatives. Many Government Commitments specify time frames for compliance and reporting. Failure to fulfill our obligations under these Government Commitments in a timely manner could result in substantial fines, penalties, or other legal and administrative actions and reputational harm.We expect to incur significant costs, expenses and fees to track, monitor, comply with and fulfill our obligations under these Government Commitments. In addition, abiding by the Government Commitments may divert our management’s time and energy away from other business operations and could force us to make business decisions we would not otherwise make and forego taking actions that might be beneficial to the Company. The challenges in satisfying the large number of Government Commitments in the required time frames and the cost incurred in tracking, monitoring and complying with them could also adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results and hinder our ability to effectively compete.Economic, political and market conditions may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.Our business, financial condition and operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, unemployment rates, economic growth, energy costs, rates of inflation (or concerns about deflation), and other macro-economic factors. The wireless industry, broadly, is dependent on population growth. In addition, the Government Commitments place certain limitations on our ability to increase prices, which limits our ability to pass growing costs to customers. Rising prices for goods, services and labor due to inflation could adversely impact our margins and/or growth.Our services and device financing plans are available to a broad customer base, a significant segment of which may be vulnerable to weak economic conditions, particularly our subprime customers. We may have greater difficulty in gaining new customers within this segment, and existing customers may be more likely to terminate service and default on device financing plans due to an inability to pay.Further, because Sprint offered a device leasing plan, we expect to realize economic benefit from the estimated residual value of a leased device, which reflects the estimated fair value of the underlying asset at the end of the expected lease term. Changes in residual value assumptions made at lease inception affect the amount of depreciation expense and the net amount of equipment revenue under operating leases. If estimated residual values, in the aggregate, significantly decline due to economic factors, including Pandemic impacts, obsolescence, or other circumstances, we may not realize such residual value. Sprint historically suffered, and we may suffer, negative consequences including increased costs and increased losses on devices as a result of a lease customer default, the related termination of a lease, and the attempted repossession of the device, including failure of a lease customer to return a leased device.Weak economic and credit conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers, dealers, and wholesale partners or MVNOs, some of which may file for bankruptcy, or may experience cash flow or liquidity problems, or may be unable to obtain or refinance credit such that they may no longer be able to operate. Any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market, or sell our products and services.15Table of ContentsOur business may be adversely impacted if we are not able to successfully manage the ongoing commercial and transition services arrangements entered into in connection with the Prepaid Transaction and known or unknown liabilities arising in connection therewith.In connection with the closing of the Prepaid Transaction, we and DISH entered into certain commercial and transition services arrangements, including a Master Network Services Agreement (the “MNSA”) and a Spectrum Purchase Agreement (the “Spectrum Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the MNSA, DISH will receive network services from the Company for a period of seven years. As set forth in the MNSA, the Company will provide DISH, among other things, (a) legacy network services for certain Boost Mobile prepaid end users on the Sprint network, (b) T-Mobile network services for certain end users that have been migrated to the T-Mobile network or provisioned on the T-Mobile network by or on behalf of DISH and (c) infrastructure mobile network operator services to assist in the access and integration of the DISH network. Pursuant to the Spectrum Purchase Agreement, DISH has agreed to purchase all of Sprint’s 800 MHz spectrum (approximately 13.5 MHz of nationwide spectrum) for a total of approximately $3.6 billion; provided, however, that if DISH breaches the Spectrum Purchase agreement prior to the closing or fails to deliver the purchase price following the satisfaction or waiver of all closing conditions, DISH’s sole liability will be to pay us a fee of approximately $72 million. In such instance, T-Mobile may be required to conduct an auction sale of all of Sprint’s 800 MHz spectrum under the terms set forth in the Consent Decree, but would not be required to divest such spectrum for an amount less than $3.6 billion. The covered spectrum sale will not occur before the third anniversary of the Merger (i.e., not before April 1, 2023), but must be divested within the later of three years after the closing of the Prepaid Transaction and five days after receipt of the approval from the FCC for the transfer, following an application for FCC approval to be filed by the third anniversary of the closing of the Merger. T-Mobile may exercise an option to lease back 4 MHz (2 MHz downlink + 2 MHz uplink) of the spectrum for two years following the closing of the 800 MHz spectrum sale at the same per person rate used to calculate the purchase price paid by DISH to T-Mobile – a rate of approximately $68 million per year.Failure to successfully manage these ongoing commercial and transition services arrangements entered into in connection with the Prepaid Transaction and liabilities arising in connection therewith may result in material unanticipated problems, including diversion of management time and energy, significant expenses and liabilities. There may also be other potential adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses or liabilities associated with the Prepaid Transaction, the occurrence of which could materially impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and operating results. In addition, there may be an increase in competition from DISH and other third parties that DISH may enter into commercial agreements with, who are significantly larger and with greater resources and scale advantages as compared to us. Such increased competition may result in our loss of customers and other business relationships.Any acquisition, investment, or merger may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business. We may pursue acquisitions of, investments in or mergers with businesses, technologies, services and/or products that complement or expand our business. Some of these potential transactions could be significant relative to the size of our business and operations. Any such transaction would involve a number of risks and could present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:•diversion of management attention from running our existing business;•increased costs to integrate the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the business involved in any such transaction with our business;•difficulties in effectively integrating the financial and operational systems of the business involved in any such transaction into (or supplanting such systems with) our financial and operational reporting infrastructure and internal control framework in an effective and timely manner;•potential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process or as a result of any litigation arising in connection with any such transaction;•significant transaction-related expenses in connection with any such transaction, whether consummated or not;•risks related to our ability to obtain any required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate any such transaction; and•any business, technology, service, or product involved in any such transaction may significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from the transaction, which could, among other things, also result in a write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with such transaction.For any or all of these reasons, as well as unknown risks, acquisitions, investments, or mergers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.16Table of ContentsWe rely on third parties to provide products and services for the operation of our business, and the failure or inability of such parties to provide these products or services could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We depend heavily on suppliers, service providers, their subcontractors and other third parties for us to efficiently operate our business. Due to the complexity of our business, it is not unusual to engage a diverse set of suppliers to help us develop, maintain, and troubleshoot products and services such as wireless and wireline network components, software development services, and billing and customer service support. Some of our suppliers may provide services from outside of the United States, which carries additional regulatory and legal obligations. We commonly rely on suppliers to provide us with contractual assurances and to disclose accurate information regarding risks associated with their provision of products or services in accordance with our policies and standards, including our Supplier Code of Conduct and our third-party risk management practices. The failure of our suppliers to comply with our expectations and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Many of the products and services we use are available through multiple sources and suppliers. However, there are a limited number of suppliers who can support or provide billing services, voice and data communications transport services, wireless or wireline network infrastructure, equipment, handsets, other devices, and payment processing services, among other products and services. Disruptions or failure of such suppliers to adequately perform could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Our suppliers, service providers and their subcontractors may not perform at the levels we expect or at the levels required by their contracts. Our suppliers are also subject to their own risks, including, but not limited to, economic, financial and credit conditions, labor force disruptions, disruptions in global supply chain and the risks of natural catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and public health crises such as the Pandemic. Our business could be severely disrupted if critical suppliers or service providers fail to comply with their contracts or if we experience delays or service degradation during any transition to a new outsourcing provider or other supplier or if we are required to replace the supplied products or services with those from another source, especially if the replacement becomes necessary on short notice. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business flexibility, ability to service our debt, and increase our borrowing costs.We have, and we expect that we will continue to have, a substantial amount of debt. Our substantial level of indebtedness could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business, economic, market and industry conditions and increasing the amount of cash required to service our debt. In addition, this level of indebtedness may also reduce funds available for capital expenditures, any potential board-approved share repurchases and other activities. Those impacts may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Further, we may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, which could increase the risks associated with our capital structure.Our ability to service our substantial debt obligations will depend on future performance, which will be affected by business, economic, market and industry conditions and other factors, including our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the Transactions. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations when due. If we are unable to meet such obligations or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing such debt obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices or make additional borrowings. We may not be able to, at any given time, refinance our debt, sell assets or make additional borrowings on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Changes in credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to raise debt favorably.Instability in the global financial markets, inflation, policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, including changes in monetary policy and interest rates, and other general economic conditions could lead to volatility in the credit and equity markets. This volatility could limit our access to the capital markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.17Table of ContentsWe are subject to risks related to the cessation of LIBOR. Amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility and certain funded amounts under our EIP sale arrangement and our service receivable sale arrangement currently bear interest at rates that are calculated based on U.S. dollar LIBOR, which is expected to be discontinued by 2023. Any alternative reference rate that replaces U.S. dollar LIBOR under our revolving credit facility, is used as a benchmark on any other borrowings or is used as a benchmark under our EIP sale arrangement or service receivable sale arrangement could be higher or more volatile than LIBOR prior to its discontinuance, which could result in an increase in the cost of our indebtedness or funded amounts. Further, credit markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. In addition, any hedging agreements we have and may continue to enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations may not offer complete protection from these risks or may be unsuccessful, and consequently may effectively increase the interest rate we pay on our debt or the exchange rate with respect to any debt we may incur in a foreign currency, and any portion not subject to such hedging agreements would have full exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations, as applicable. If any financial institutions that are parties to our hedging agreements were to default on their payment obligations to us, declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, we would be unhedged against the underlying exposures. Any posting of collateral by us under our hedging agreements and the modification or termination of any of our hedging agreements could negatively impact our liquidity or other financial metrics. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financings include restrictive covenants that limit our operatingflexibility.The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financings impose material operating and financial restrictions. These restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions and maintenance and incurrence-based financial tests, together with our debt service obligations, may limit our ability to engage in transactions and pursue strategic business opportunities. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain debt financing, make share repurchases, refinance or pay principal on our outstanding indebtedness, complete acquisitions for cash or indebtedness or react to business, economic, market and industry conditions and other changes in our operating environment or the economy. Any future indebtedness that we incur may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our debt agreements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these and other agreements, giving our lenders the right to terminate the commitments they had made or the right to require us to repay all amounts then outstanding plus any interest, fees, penalties or premiums. An event of default may also compel us to sell certain assets securing indebtedness under these agreements.Credit rating downgrades and/or inability to access debt markets could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and operating results. Credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, as a result, cost of capital. Our current ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. Our capital structure and business model are reliant on continued access to debt markets. Each rating agency reviews our ratings periodically, and there can be no assurance that such ratings will be maintained in the future. A downgrade in our corporate rating and/or our issued debt ratings, or our amount of secured debt outstanding, could impact our ability to access debt markets, including the investment-grade debt market for our secured debt issuances, and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and operating results. Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory MattersAny material weaknesses we identify while we continue to work to integrate and align policies, principles and practices of the two companies following the Merger, or any other failure by us to maintain effective internal controls, could result in a loss of investor confidence regarding our financial statements and reputational damage. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we, along with our independent registered public accounting firm, are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. While we continue to integrate and align the policies, principles and practices of the two companies following the Merger, as a result of the differences in control environments and cultures, we could identify material weaknesses that could result in materially inaccurate financial statements, materially inaccurate disclosures, or failure to prevent error or fraud for the combined company. There can be no assurance that remediation of any material weaknesses identified during integration of the two companies would be completed in a timely manner or that the remedial measures will prevent other control deficiencies or material weaknesses. If we are unable to remediate material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, then our ability to analyze, record and report financial information free of material misstatements, to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC and otherwise to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act would be 18Table of Contentsnegatively impacted. The impact could negatively impact our business, financial condition or operating results, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require the expenditure of significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies, subject us to fines, penalties, investigations or judgments, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in trading price of our stock and investor confidence.Changes in regulations or in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We are subject to regulatory oversight by various federal, state and local agencies, as well as judicial review and actions, on issues related to the wireless industry that include, but are not limited to, roaming, interconnection, spectrum allocation and licensing, facilities siting, pole attachments, intercarrier compensation, Universal Service Fund, 911 services, consumer protection, consumer privacy, and cybersecurity. We are also subject to regulations in connection with other aspects of our business, including device financing and insurance activities.The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale, and interconnection of wireless communications systems, as do some state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and the resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. Changes necessary to resolve interference issues or concerns may have a significant impact on our ability to fully utilize our spectrum. As an example, we recently we won spectrum licenses in the so-called “C band” to support our rollout of 5G technology and services. There have been concerns raised that use of this spectrum by wireless carriers for 5G deployment could interfere with the altimeters in certain aircraft, and there is an ongoing discussion between the industry, the FCC and the FAA as to whether and how 5G operations should be limited around airports. Additionally, the FTC and other federal and state agencies have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection, and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of wireless products and services. We cannot assure that the FCC or any other federal, state or local agencies will not adopt regulations, implement new programs in response to the Pandemic, or take enforcement or other actions that would adversely affect our business, impose new costs, or require changes in current or planned operations, including timing of the shutdown of legacy technologies. For example, in response to the Pandemic, the California Public Utilities Commission adopted a resolution providing a moratorium on customer disconnects and late fees for certain California customers facing financial hardship. Additionally, in March 2015, the FCC established net neutrality and privacy regimes that applied to our operations. Both sets of rules potentially subjected some of our initiatives and practices to more burdensome requirements and heightened scrutiny by federal and state regulators, the public, edge providers, and private litigants regarding whether such initiatives or practices are compliant. While the FCC rules were largely rolled back in December 2017, the current FCC could decide to establish new net neutrality requirements. In addition, some states and other jurisdictions have enacted laws in these areas (including, for example, the CCPA and CPRA as discussed below) and others are considering enacting similar laws. It also is uncertain what rules may be promulgated under the current administration (e.g., the FTC has discussed promulgating privacy rules), perpetuating the risk and uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment and compliance around these issues.In addition, states are increasingly focused on the quality of service and support that wireless communications service providers provide to their customers and several states have proposed or enacted new and potentially burdensome regulations in this area. We also face potential investigations by, and inquiries from or actions by state public utility commissions. We also cannot assure that Congress will not amend the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, and which serves to limit state authority, or enact other legislation in a manner that could be adverse to our business. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We could be subject to fines, forfeitures, and other penalties (including, in extreme cases, revocation of our spectrum licenses) for failure to comply with FCC or other governmental regulations, even if any such noncompliance was unintentional. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Laws and regulations relating to the handling of privacy and data protection may result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage.In January 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) became effective, creating new data privacy rights for California residents and new compliance obligations for us. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant implementation costs to ensure compliance with the CCPA, and we could see increased litigation costs. Moreover, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), was passed by Californians via ballot initiative during the November 19Table of Contents3, 2020 election. The CPRA, which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023 (with a lookback to January 1, 2022), will significantly modify the CCPA and will impose additional data protection obligations on companies such as ours doing business in California. Other states (such as Nevada) have passed or are considering similar legislation (such as Washington), which could create more risks and potential costs for us, especially to the extent the specific requirements vary from those in California, Nevada and other existing laws.We have incurred and will continue to incur significant implementation costs to ensure compliance with the CCPA, the CPRA, and their related regulations and any additional laws and regulations could cause us to incur further costs or further constrain our business, strategies, offerings and initiatives.Unfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.We and our affiliates are involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, investigations and proceedings and litigation matters. Such legal proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energy of management and other key personnel.In connection with the Transactions, it is possible that stockholders of T-Mobile and/or Sprint may file putative class action lawsuits or shareholder derivative actions against the Company and the legacy T-Mobile board of directors and/or the legacy Sprint board of directors. Among other remedies, these stockholders could seek damages. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain and any such potential lawsuits could result in substantial costs and may be costly and distracting to management.Additionally, on April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed the contingencies and litigation matters of Sprint. Those matters include a wide variety of disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions and other proceedings, including, among other things, certain ongoing FCC and state government agency investigations into Sprint’s Lifeline program. In September 2019, Sprint notified the FCC that it had claimed monthly subsidies for serving customers even though those customers may not have met usage requirements under Sprint’s usage policy for the Lifeline program due to an inadvertent coding issue in the system used to identify qualifying customer usage that occurred in July 2017 while the system was being updated. Sprint has made a number of payments to reimburse the federal government and certain states for excess subsidy payments. Unfavorable resolution of these matters could require making additional reimbursements and paying additional fines and penalties.On February 28, 2020, we received a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Admonishment from the FCC, which proposed a penalty against us for allegedly violating Section 222 of the Communications Act and the FCC’s regulations governing the privacy of customer information. We recorded an accrual for an estimated payment amount as of March 31, 2020, which was included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.As a result of the August 2021 cyberattack, we are subject to numerous lawsuits, including multiple class action lawsuits seeking unspecified monetary damages, mass arbitrations, and inquiries by various government agencies, law enforcement and other governmental authorities, and we may be subject to further regulatory inquiries and private litigation. We are cooperating fully with regulators and vigorously defending against the class actions and other lawsuits. In light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these proceedings and inquiries, as of the date of this report, we have not recorded any accruals for losses related to these proceedings and inquiries, as any such amounts are not yet probable or estimable. We believe it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses associated with these proceedings and inquiries, and we will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Ongoing legal and other costs related to these proceedings and inquiries, as well as any potential future proceedings and inquiries, may be substantial, and losses associated with any adverse judgments, settlements, penalties or other resolutions of such proceedings and inquiries could be significant and have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results. We, along with equipment manufacturers and other carriers, are subject to current and potential future lawsuits alleging adverse health effects arising from the use of wireless handsets or from wireless transmission equipment such as cell towers. In addition, the FCC has from time to time gathered data regarding wireless device emissions, and its assessment of the risks associated with using wireless devices may evolve based on its findings. Any of these allegations or changes in risk assessments could result in customers purchasing fewer devices and wireless services, could result in significant legal and regulatory liability, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.20Table of ContentsThe assessment of the outcome of legal proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or pursuant to final judgment, order or decree may differ materially from amounts accrued in our financial statements. In addition, litigation or similar proceedings could impose restraints on our current or future manner of doing business. Such potential outcomes including judgments, awards, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.We offer regulated financial services products. These products expose us to a wide variety of state and federal regulations. The financing of devices, such as through our EIP, JUMP! On Demand or other leasing programs, such as those acquired in the Merger, has expanded our regulatory compliance obligations. Failure to remain compliant with applicable regulations may increase our risk exposure in the following areas:•consumer complaints and potential examinations or enforcement actions by federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, state attorneys general, the FCC and the FTC; and•regulatory fines, penalties, enforcement actions, civil litigation, and/or class action lawsuits.Failure to comply with applicable regulations and the realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Our business may be impacted by new or amended tax laws or regulations or administrative interpretations and judicial decisions affecting the scope or application of tax laws or regulations.In connection with the products and services we sell, we calculate, collect, and remit various federal, state, and local taxes, fees and regulatory charges (“tax” or “taxes”) to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including federal and state USF contributions and common carrier regulatory charges and public safety fees. As many of our service plans offer taxes and fees inclusive, our business results could be adversely impacted by increases in taxes and fees. In addition, we incur and pay state and local transaction taxes and fees on purchases of goods and services used in our business.Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In many cases, the application of existing, newly enacted or amended tax laws may be uncertain and subject to different interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services, such as broadband internet access and cloud related services and in the context of our merger with Sprint. Legislative changes, administrative interpretations and judicial decisions affecting the scope or application of tax laws could also impact revenue reported and taxes due on tax inclusive plans.In the event that T-Mobile, including pre-acquisition Sprint, has incorrectly described, disclosed, determined, calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts that were due to governmental authorities, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In the event that federal, state, and/or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes and regulatory or public safety charges on our network, operations, or services, or seek to impose new taxes or charges, such as a proposed corporate minimum tax or new limits on interest deductibility, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Our wireless licenses are subject to renewal and may be revoked in the event that we violate applicable laws. Our existing wireless licenses are subject to renewal upon the expiration of the period for which they are granted. Our licenses have been granted with an expectation of renewal and the FCC has approved our license renewal applications. However, the Communications Act provides that licenses may be revoked for cause and license renewal applications denied if the FCC determines that a renewal would not serve the public interest. If we fail to timely file to renew any wireless license or fail to meet any regulatory requirements for renewal, including construction and substantial service requirements, we could be denied a license renewal. Many of our wireless licenses are subject to interim or final construction requirements and there is no guarantee that the FCC will find our construction, or the construction of prior licensees, sufficient to meet the build-out or renewal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure that the FCC will renew our wireless licenses upon their expiration. If any of our wireless licenses were to be revoked or not renewed upon expiration, we would not be permitted to provide services under that license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 21Table of ContentsRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockOur Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions and proceedings, which could limit the ability of our stockholders to obtain a judicial forum of their choice for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or employees.Our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or employee of the Company to the Company or its stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Company's bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim arising under, in connection with, and governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision does not waive our compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Moreover, the provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.This choice of forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers and employees, even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could increase our costs of litigation and adversely affect our business and financial condition.Each of DT, which controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock, and SoftBank, a significant stockholder of T-Mobile, may have interests that differ from the interests of our other stockholders. Upon the completion of the Transactions, DT and SoftBank entered into the SoftBank Proxy Agreement, and on June 22, 2020, DT, Claure Mobile LLC (“CM LLC”), and Marcelo Claure entered into a Proxy, Lock-up and ROFR Agreement (“the Claure Proxy Agreement,” together with the SoftBank Proxy Agreement, the “Proxy Agreements”). Pursuant to the Proxy Agreements, at any meeting of our stockholders, the shares of our common stock beneficially owned by SoftBank or CM LLC will be voted in the manner as directed by DT.Accordingly, DT controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock and therefore we are a “controlled company,” as defined in The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) listing rules, and we are not subject to NASDAQ requirements that would otherwise require us to have a majority of independent directors, a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors. Accordingly, our stockholders will not be afforded the same protections generally as stockholders of other NASDAQ-listed companies with respect to corporate governance for so long as we rely on these exemptions from the corporate governance requirements.In addition, pursuant to our Certificate of Incorporation and the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement, as long as DT beneficially owns 30% or more of our outstanding common stock, we are restricted from taking certain actions without DT’s prior written consent, including (i) incurring indebtedness above certain levels based on a specified debt to cash flow ratio, (ii) taking any action that would cause a default under any instrument evidencing indebtedness involving DT or its affiliates, (iii) acquiring or disposing of assets or entering into mergers or similar acquisitions in excess of $1.0 billion, (iv) changing the size of our board of directors, (v) subject to certain exceptions, issuing equity of 10% or more of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock, or issuing equity to redeem debt held by DT, (vi) repurchasing or redeeming equity securities or making any extraordinary or in-kind dividend other than on a pro rata basis, or (vii) making certain changes involving our CEO. We are also restricted from amending our Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws in any manner that could adversely affect DT’s rights under the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement for as long as DT beneficially owns 5% or more of our outstanding common stock. These restrictions could prevent us from taking actions that our board of directors may otherwise determine are in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders or that may be in the best interests of our other stockholders.DT effectively has control over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, changes to our Certificate of Incorporation, a sale or merger of our Company and other transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law. DT’s controlling interest may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, the Company. DT and SoftBank, as significant 22Table of Contentsstockholders, may have strategic, financial, or other interests different from our other stockholders, including as the holder of a substantial amount of our indebtedness and as the counterparty in a number of commercial arrangements, and may make decisions adverse to the interests of our other stockholders.In addition, we license certain trademarks from DT, including the right to use the trademark “T-Mobile” as a name for the Company and our flagship brand, under a trademark license agreement, as amended, with DT. As described in more detail in our Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on April 21, 2021 under the heading “Transactions with Related Persons and Approval,” we are obligated to pay DT a royalty in an amount equal to 0.25% (the “royalty rate”) of the net revenue (as defined in the trademark license) generated by products and services sold by the Company under the licensed trademarks subject to a cap of $80.0 million per calendar year through December 31, 2028. We and DT are obligated to negotiate a new trademark license when (i) DT has 50% or less of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or (ii) any third party owns or controls, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or otherwise has the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Company. If we and DT fail to agree on a new trademark license, either we or DT may terminate the trademark license and such termination shall be effective, in the case of clause (i) above, on the third anniversary after notice of termination and, in the case of clause (ii) above, on the second anniversary after notice of termination. A further increase in the royalty rate or termination of the trademark license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Future sales of our common stock by DT and SoftBank and foreign ownership limitations by the FCC could have a negative impact on our stock price and decrease the value of our stock.We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock by DT or SoftBank will have on the prevailing trading price of our common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline.We, DT and SoftBank are parties to the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement pursuant to which DT is free to transfer its shares in public sales without notice, as long as such transactions would not result in a third party owning more than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If a transfer would exceed the 30% threshold, it is prohibited unless the transfer is approved by our board of directors, or the transferee makes a binding offer to purchase all of the other outstanding shares on the same price and terms. The Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement does not otherwise impose any other restrictions on the sales of common stock by DT or SoftBank. Moreover, the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement generally requires us to cooperate with DT to facilitate the resale of our common stock or debt securities held by DT under shelf registration statements we have filed. The sale of shares of our common stock by DT or SoftBank (other than in transactions involving the purchase of all of our outstanding shares) could significantly increase the number of shares available in the market, which could cause a decrease in our stock price. In addition, even if DT or SoftBank does not sell a large number of their shares into the market, their rights to transfer a large number of shares into the market may depress our stock price.Furthermore, under existing law, no more than 20% of an FCC licensee’s capital stock may be directly owned, or no more than 25% indirectly owned, or voted by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, by a foreign government or its representatives or by a foreign corporation. If an FCC licensee is controlled by another entity, up to 25% of that entity’s capital stock may be owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, by a foreign government or its representatives or by a foreign corporation. Foreign ownership above the 25% holding company level may be allowed if the FCC finds such higher levels consistent with the public interest. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest with respect to investors from certain nations. If our foreign ownership by previously unapproved foreign parties were to exceed the permitted level, the FCC could subject us to a range of penalties, including an order for us to divest the foreign ownership in part, fines, license revocation or denials of license renewals. If ownership of our common stock by an unapproved foreign entity were to become subject to such limitations, or if any ownership of our common stock violates any other rule or regulation of the FCC applicable to us, our Certificate of Incorporation provides for certain redemption provisions at a pre-determined price which may be less than fair market value. These limitations and our Certificate of Incorporation may limit our ability to attract additional equity financing outside the United States and decrease the value of our common stock.We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our credit facilities and indentures governing our long-term debt to 23Table of Contentsaffiliates and third parties contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to use future earnings, if any, to invest in our business and for general corporate purposes, including the integration of T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s businesses, the continued build-out of our 5G network and potential share repurchases as appropriate. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of potential gain.Risks Related to Integration Although we expect that the Transactions will result in synergies and other benefits, those synergies and benefits may not be realized in the amounts anticipated or may not be realized within the expected time frame, and risks associated with the foregoing may also result from the extended delay in the integration of the companies. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate our and Sprint’s businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the projected cost savings. In addition, some of the anticipated synergies are not expected to occur for a significant time period following the completion of the Transactions and will require substantial capital expenditures in the near term.Our anticipated synergies and other benefits of the Transactions may be reduced or eliminated, including a delay in the integration of, or an inability to integrate, the networks of T-Mobile and Sprint. Even if we are able to integrate the two companies successfully, the anticipated benefits of the Transactions, including the expected synergies and network benefits, may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.We have incurred substantial expenses as a result of completing the Transactions. We expect to incur substantial additional expenses in connection with migrating the Sprint customer base and integrating T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s businesses, operations, policies and procedures and compliance with the Government Commitments. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction-related expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could exceed the costs historically borne by us and offset the expected synergies.Our business and Sprint’s business may not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected. Operating costs, customer loss and business disruptions, including challenges in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, suppliers or vendors, may be greater than expected.The combination of two independent businesses is complex, costly and time-consuming, and may divert significant management attention and resources. This process may disrupt our business or otherwise impact our ability to compete. The overall combination of our and Sprint’s businesses may also result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses and impacts, and loss of customers and other business relationships. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:•diversion of management attention to integration matters;•difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including intellectual property and communications systems, administrative and information technology infrastructure, and supplier and vendor arrangements;•challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies;•alignment of key performance measurements may result in a greater need to communicate and manage clear expectations while we work to integrate and align policies and practices;•difficulties in integrating employees;•the need to address possible differences in corporate cultures, management philosophies, and compensation structures;•challenges in retaining existing customers and obtaining new customers;•difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;•any disruptions to the operations and business in the Shentel service area following the Company’s acquisition of Wireless Assets (as defined in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) as a result of the transition of such assets to the Company;•compliance with Government Commitments relating to national security;•known or potential unknown liabilities of Sprint that are larger than expected; and•other potential adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses or liabilities associated with the Transactions.Additionally, uncertainties over the integration process could cause customers, suppliers, distributors, dealers, retailers and others to seek to change or cancel our existing business relationships or to refuse to renew existing relationships. Suppliers, 24Table of Contentsdistributors and content and application providers may also delay or cease developing new products for us that are necessary for the operations of our business due to uncertainties. Competitors may also target our existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties.Some of these factors are outside our control, and any one of them could result in lower revenues, higher costs and diversion of management time and energy, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, even if the integration is successful, the full benefits of the Transactions including, among others, the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities may not be realized within the anticipated time frames or at all.In connection with the Merger, we are evaluating the long-term billing system architecture strategy for our customers. Our long-term strategy is to migrate Sprint’s legacy customers onto T-Mobile’s existing billing platforms. We will operate and maintain multiple billing systems until such conversion is completed. Any unanticipated difficulties, disruption, or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial, and reputational effects on our business. Following the closing of the Merger, we are operating and maintaining multiple billing systems. We expect to continue to do so until successful conversion of Sprint’s legacy customers to T-Mobile’s existing billing platforms. We may encounter unanticipated difficulties or experience delays in the ongoing integration efforts with respect to billing, causing major system or business disruptions. In addition, we or our supporting vendors may experience errors, cyber-attacks or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact us and over which we may have limited control. Interruptions and/or failure of these billing systems could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to provide or bill for our services, retain customers, attract new customers or negatively impact overall customer experience. Any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition, and/or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and reputational damage.Item 1B.

Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable.PART II.Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket InformationOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “TMUS.” We are included within the S&P 500 in the Wireless Telecommunication Services GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard) Sub-Industry index. As of January 31, 2022, there were 15,953 registered stockholders of record of our common stock, but we estimate the total number of stockholders to be much higher as a number of our shares are held by brokers or dealers for their customers in street name.We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our credit facilities and indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to use future earnings, if any, to invest in our business and for general corporate purposes, including the integration of T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s businesses, the continued build-out of our 5G network and potential share repurchases as appropriate. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of potential gain.26Table of ContentsPerformance GraphThe graph below compares the five-year cumulative total returns of T-Mobile, the S&P 500 index, the NASDAQ Composite index and the Dow Jones US Mobile Telecommunications TSM index.

[Reserved]27Table of ContentsItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewThe objectives of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) are to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with the following:•A narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results;•Context to the consolidated financial statements; and•Information that allows assessment of the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.Our MD&A is performed on a consolidated basis and is inclusive of the results and operations of Sprint prospectively from the close of the Merger on April 1, 2020. The Merger enhanced our spectrum portfolio, increased our customer base, altered our product mix and created opportunities for synergies in our operations. We anticipate an initial increase in our combined operating costs, which we expect to decrease as we realize synergies. We expect the trends and results of operations of the combined company to be materially different than those of the standalone entities.Our MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our MD&A are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.Sprint MergerTransaction OverviewOn April 1, 2020, we completed the Merger with Sprint, a communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services. As a result, Sprint and its subsidiaries became wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries of T-Mobile.The Merger has altered the size and scope of our operations, impacting our assets, liabilities, obligations, capital requirements and performance measures. We expect the trends and results of operations of the combined company to be materially different than those of the standalone entities. As a combined company, we have been able to enhance the breadth and depth of our nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation, increase competition in the U.S. wireless and broadband industries and achieve significant synergies and cost reductions by eliminating redundancies within the combined network as well as other business processes and operations.For more information regarding the Merger, see Note 2 – Business Combinations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Shentel Wireless Assets AcquisitionOn July 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Shentel’s wireless telecommunications assets (the “Wireless Assets”) used to provide Sprint PCS’s wireless mobility communications network products in certain parts of Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio and Pennsylvania. As a result, T-Mobile become the legal owner of the Wireless Assets.This transaction represented an opportunity to reacquire the exclusive rights to deliver Sprint’s wireless network services in Shentel’s former affiliate territory and simplify our operations. The acquisition of the Wireless Assets has altered the composition of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet, including Goodwill and Other intangible assets.For more information regarding our acquisition of the Wireless Assets, see Note 2 – Business Combinations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.28Table of ContentsMerger-Related CostsMerger-related costs associated with the Merger and acquisitions of affiliates generally include:•Integration costs to achieve efficiencies in network, retail, information technology and back office operations, migrate customers to the T-Mobile network and the impact of legal matters assumed as part of the Merger;•Restructuring costs, including severance, store rationalization and network decommissioning; and•Transaction costs, including legal and professional services related to the completion of the transactions.Transaction and restructuring costs are disclosed in Note 2 – Business Combinations and Note 18 – Restructuring Costs, respectively, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Merger-related costs have been excluded from our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, as we do not consider these costs to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance. See “Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA” in the “Performance Measures” section of this MD&A. Cash payments for Merger-related costs, including payments related to our restructuring plan, are included in Net cash provided by operating activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Merger-related costs are presented below:(in millions)Year Ended December 31,2021 Versus 20202020 Versus 2019202120202019$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeMerger-related costsCost of services, exclusive of depreciation and amortization$1,015 $646 $— $369 57 %$646 NMCost of equipment sales1,018 6 — 1,012 NM6 NMSelling, general and administrative1,074 1,263 620 (189)(15)%643 104 %Total Merger-related costs$3,107 $1,915 $620 $1,192 62 %$1,295 209 %Cash payments for Merger-related costs$2,170 $1,493 $442 $677 45 %$1,051 238 %NM - Not MeaningfulMerger-related costs will be impacted by restructuring and integration activities expected to occur through the end of fiscal year 2023, as we implement initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from the Merger and our acquisitions of affiliates. Transaction costs, including legal and professional service fees related to the completion of the Merger and acquisitions of affiliates, are expected to continue to decrease.RestructuringUpon the close of the Merger, we began implementing restructuring initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from the Merger. The major activities associated with the restructuring initiatives to date include:•Contract termination costs associated with rationalization of retail stores, distribution channels, duplicative network and backhaul services and other agreements;•Severance costs associated with the reduction of redundant processes and functions; and•The decommissioning of certain small cell sites and distributed antenna systems to achieve synergies in network costs. Anticipated ImpactsWe expect to incur a total of $12.0 billion of Merger-related costs, excluding capital expenditures, of which $6.5 billion has been incurred since the beginning of 2018, including $700 million of costs incurred by Sprint prior to the Merger.Our remaining integration and restructuring activities are expected to occur over the next two years with substantially all costs incurred by the end of fiscal year 2023. We expect to incur total Merger-related costs, excluding capital expenditures, of $5.5 billion to complete our remaining integration and restructuring activities, $4.5 billion to $5.0 billion of which is expected to be incurred in fiscal year 2022. We are evaluating additional restructuring initiatives which are dependent on consultations and negotiation with certain counterparties and the expected impact on our business operations, which could affect the amount or timing of the restructuring costs and related payments. We expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our 29Table of Contentsliquidity requirements and anticipated payments associated with the restructuring initiatives.As a result of our ongoing restructuring activities, we expect to realize cost efficiencies by eliminating redundancies within our combined network as well as other business processes and operations. We expect these activities to result in a reduction of expenses in Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.For more information regarding our restructuring activities, see Note 18 – Restructuring Costs of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.CyberattackAs we previously reported, we were subject to a criminal cyberattack involving unauthorized access to T-Mobile’s systems. We became aware of a potential issue on August 12, 2021. We immediately began a forensic investigation and engaged cybersecurity experts to assist with the assessment of the incident and to help determine what data was impacted. As we previously reported, we promptly located and closed the unauthorized access to our systems. Our investigation uncovered that the perpetrator illegally gained access to certain areas of our systems on or about March 18, 2021, but only gained access to and took data of current, former and prospective customers beginning on or about August 3, 2021. Based on the initial investigation findings, we moved to quickly identify current, former and prospective customers whose information was impacted and notify them, consistent with state and federal requirements. Simultaneously, we undertook a number of other measures to demonstrate our continued support and commitment to data privacy and protection and continued to work with our cybersecurity experts to finish our forensic investigation, with the goal to ensure we had a complete understanding of the scope and impact of the unauthorized access. We also coordinated our efforts with law enforcement.Also as previously reported, our forensic investigation took time and was completed in October 2021, although our overall investigation into the incident is ongoing. As a result of our forensic investigation, we believe we have a full view of the data compromised. We have no evidence that individual financial account numbers, such as full credit or debit card numbers, were accessed or taken in relation to the August 2021 cyberattack. Throughout our forensic investigation of the August 2021 cyberattack, our top priority was to support those individuals impacted by the cyberattack. We sent notifications to our customers and customer accounts whose names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers (“SSNs”)/Tax Identifiers (“Tax IDs”) and driver’s license/identification numbers (“ID Numbers”) were taken, consistent with state and federal requirements, including to approximately 7.8 million current customer accounts and approximately 40.0 million former and prospective customers. We also notified an additional 1.9 million former and prospective customers who had their names, dates of birth and ID Numbers (but not valid SSNs/Tax IDs) taken. Out of an abundance of caution during the earliest days of our investigation and to help alleviate consumer concerns and confusion, we rapidly sent notifications to approximately 5.3 million customer accounts who had their names, dates of birth and addresses taken. These accounts did not have SSNs/Tax IDs or ID Numbers taken. Later in our investigation, we identified approximately 790,000 additional former and prospective customers who had similar information — names, dates of birth and, in many cases, addresses, but not SSNs/Tax IDs or ID Numbers — taken and sent them notifications consistent with state and federal requirements. Our investigation also identified approximately 26.0 million additional individuals with the same types of information taken, but for whom individual notifications were not required under state and federal law in light of the types of information taken. By that point, since our original notifications, we had already launched a broad-reaching communications outreach program through which we kept our customers and the public informed and made information available and accessible on our website to provide support for any individuals who may have been impacted, including information on how they could take steps to protect themselves.We also took actions to proactively reset the personal identification numbers (“PINs”) for approximately 870,000 current customer accounts whose names and PINs may have been taken. We previously reported that further data files including phone numbers, International Mobile Equipment Identity (“IMEI”) numbers and International Mobile Subscriber Identity (“IMSI”) numbers were taken; a significant portion of this data was related to inactive devices. For a number of additional current Metro customers, these files included names but no other personally identifiable information.30Table of ContentsAs described above, supporting individuals impacted by the August 2021 cyberattack was a top priority. As previously reported, this support included:•Offering two years of free identity protection services with McAfee’s ID Theft Protection Service to any person who believes they may be affected;•Recommending that all eligible customers sign up for free scam-blocking protection through Scam Shield;•Supporting individuals impacted by the August 2021 cyberattack with additional best practices and practical security steps such as resetting PINs and passwords; and•Publishing a customer support webpage that includes information and access to these tools at https://www.t-mobile.com/brand/data-breach-20211.As described above, we take data protection and the protection of our customers very seriously, and we have worked diligently to further enhance security across our platforms throughout this process. As part of those efforts, and as we have previously reported, we have entered into long-term partnerships with the industry-leading cybersecurity experts at Mandiant, and with consulting firm KPMG LLP, as part of our efforts to ensure that the Company has cybersecurity practices that are among the best in our industry. We have also created a Cyber Transformation Office reporting directly to our Chief Executive Officer that will be responsible for managing our efforts. We have incurred certain cyberattack-related expenses that were not material and expect to continue to incur additional expenses in future periods, including costs to remediate the attack, provide additional customer support and enhance customer protection, only some of which may be covered and reimbursable by insurance. We also intend to commit substantial additional resources towards cybersecurity initiatives over the next several years.It is not possible to precisely measure the amount of lost revenue, if any, directly attributable to the August 2021 cyberattack. We are unable to predict the full impact of the August 2021 cyberattack on customer behavior in the future, including whether a change in our customers’ behavior could negatively impact our results of operations on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, we are not able to predict with any certainty any possible future impact to our revenues or expenses attributable to the August 2021 cyberattack, which could have a material adverse effect on our future results.As a result of the attack, we are subject to numerous arbitration demands and lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, and regulatory inquiries as described in Note 17 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and we could be subject to additional lawsuits and inquiries. We are cooperating fully with regulators in connection with the inquiries, though we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any of these inquiries. In light of the inherent uncertainties involved in such matters and based on the information currently available to us, as of the date of this Annual Report, we have not recorded any accruals for losses related to the above proceedings and inquiries as any such amounts (or ranges of amounts) are not probable or estimable at this time. We believe it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses associated with these proceedings and inquiries, and the Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Losses associated with any adverse judgments, settlements, penalties or other resolutions of such proceedings and inquiries, including ongoing costs related thereto, could be material to our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results in future periods. COVID-19 PandemicThe Pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected businesses, economies and financial markets worldwide, and has caused significant volatility in the U.S. and international debt and equity markets. The impact of the Pandemic has been wide-ranging, including, but not limited to, the temporary closures of many businesses and schools, “shelter in place” orders, travel restrictions, social distancing guidelines and other governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the Pandemic. These restrictions have impacted, and will continue to impact, our business, including the demand for our products and services and the ways in which our customers purchase and use them. In addition, the Pandemic has resulted in economic uncertainty, which could affect our customers’ purchasing decisions and ability to make timely payments. The availability of vaccines, as well as our continued social distancing measures and incremental cleaning efforts, have facilitated the continued operation of our retail stores. Additionally, we have implemented testing policies for our on-site employees to help reduce transmission. We will continue to monitor the Pandemic and its impacts and may adjust our actions as needed to continue to provide our products and services to our communities and employees. As a critical communications infrastructure provider as designated by the government, our focus has been on providing crucial connectivity to our customers and impacted communities while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees.1 The reference to this website is intended to be an inactive textual reference and information on or accessible from such website is not included or incorporated in this report.31Table of ContentsResults of OperationsSet forth below is a summary of our consolidated financial results:Year Ended December 31,2021 Versus 20202020 Versus 2019(in millions)202120202019$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeRevenuesPostpaid revenues$42,562 $36,306 $22,673 $6,256 17 %$13,633 60 %Prepaid revenues9,733 9,421 9,543 312 3 %(122)(1)%Wholesale revenues3,751 2,590 1,279 1,161 45 %1,311 103 %Other service revenues2,323 2,078 1,005 245 12 %1,073 107 %Total service revenues58,369 50,395 34,500 7,974 16 %15,895 46 %Equipment revenues20,727 17,312 9,840 3,415 20 %7,472 76 %Other revenues1,022 690 658 332 48 %32 5 %Total revenues80,118 68,397 44,998 11,721 17 %23,399 52 %Operating expensesCost of services, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below13,934 11,878 6,622 2,056 17 %5,256 79 %Cost of equipment sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below22,671 16,388 11,899 6,283 38 %4,489 38 %Selling, general and administrative20,238 18,926 14,139 1,312 7 %4,787 34 %Impairment expense— 418 — (418)(100)%418 NMDepreciation and amortization16,383 14,151 6,616 2,232 16 %7,535 114 %Total operating expenses73,226 61,761 39,276 11,465 19 %22,485 57 %Operating income6,892 6,636 5,722 256 4 %914 16 %Other income (expense)Interest expense(3,189)(2,483)(727)(706)28 %(1,756)242 %Interest expense to affiliates(173)(247)(408)74 (30)%161 (39)%Interest income20 29 24 (9)(31)%5 21 %Other expense, net(199)(405)(8)206 (51)%(397)4,963 %Total other expense, net(3,541)(3,106)(1,119)(435)14 %(1,987)178 %Income from continuing operations before income taxes3,351 3,530 4,603 (179)(5)%(1,073)(23)%Income tax expense (327)(786)(1,135)459 (58)%349 (31)%Income from continuing operations3,024 2,744 3,468 280 10 %(724)(21)%Income from discontinued operations, net of tax— 320 — (320)(100)%320 NMNet income$3,024 $3,064 $3,468 $(40)(1)%$(404)(12)%Statement of Cash Flows DataNet cash provided by operating activities$13,917 $8,640 $6,824 $5,277 61 %$1,816 27 %Net cash used in investing activities(19,386)(12,715)(4,125)(6,671)52 %(8,590)208 %Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities1,709 13,010 (2,374)(11,301)(87)%15,384 (648)%Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA26,924 24,557 13,383 2,367 10 %11,174 83 %Core Adjusted EBITDA23,576 20,376 12,784 3,200 16 %7,592 59 %Free Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps5,646 3,0014,3192,64588 %(1,318)(31)%NM - Not Meaningful32Table of ContentsThe following discussion and analysis is for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020 unless otherwise stated.

(“Sprint Communications”) and Sprint Capital Corporation (collectively, the “Sprint Issuers”). Amounts previously disclosed for the estimated values of certain acquired assets and liabilities assumed have been adjusted based on additional information arising subsequent to the initial valuation. These revisions to the estimated values did not have a significant impact on our summarized financial information for the consolidated obligor group.Pursuant to the applicable indentures and supplemental indentures, the Senior Notes to affiliates and third parties issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc. and the Sprint Issuers (collectively, the “Issuers”) are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile (“Parent”) and certain of Parent’s 100% owned subsidiaries (“Guarantor Subsidiaries”). Pursuant to the applicable indentures and supplemental indentures, the Senior Secured Notes to third parties issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc. are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis by Parent and the Guarantor Subsidiaries, except for the Guarantees of Sprint, Sprint Communications and Sprint Capital Corporation, which are provided on a senior unsecured basis.The guarantees of the Guarantor Subsidiaries are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. The indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements governing the long-term debt contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers or borrowers and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to incur more debt, pay dividends and make distributions, make certain investments, repurchase stock, create liens or other encumbrances, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit agreements, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt restrict the ability of the Issuers or borrowers to loan funds or make payments to Parent.

The assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined affiliates whose securities are pledged as Collateral are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.Performance MeasuresIn managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our consolidated financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures. These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry on key operating and financial measures.The performance measures presented below include the impact of the Merger on a prospective basis from the close date of April 1, 2020 and the impact of the acquisition of the Wireless Assets from Shentel on a prospective basis from the close date of July 1, 2021. Historical results prior to the respective close dates have not been retroactively adjusted.CustomersA customer is generally defined as a SIM number with a unique T-Mobile identifier which is associated with an account that generates revenue. Customers are qualified either for postpaid service utilizing phones, High Speed Internet, wearables, DIGITS or other connected devices, which include tablets and SyncUp products, where they generally pay after receiving service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance of receiving service.The following table sets forth the number of ending customers:As of December 31,2021 Versus 20202020 Versus 2019(in thousands)202120202019#%#%Customers, end of periodPostpaid phone customers (1)(2)70,262 66,618 40,345 3,644 5 %26,273 65 %Postpaid other customers (1)(2)17,401 14,732 6,689 2,669 18 %8,043 120 %Total postpaid customers87,663 81,350 47,034 6,313 8 %34,316 73 %Prepaid customers (1)21,056 20,714 20,860 342 2 %(146)(1)%Total customers108,719 102,064 67,894 6,655 7 %34,170 50 %Acquired customers, net of base adjustments (1)(2)818 29,228 (616)(28,410)(97)%29,844 NM(1) Includes customers acquired in connection with the Merger and certain customer base adjustments.

Starting with the three months ended March 31, 2020, we discontinued reporting wholesale customers to focus on postpaid and prepaid customers and wholesale revenues, which we consider more relevant than the number of wholesale customers given the expansion of M2M and IoT products.(2) Prepaid customers with a device installment billing plan historically included as Sprint postpaid customers have been reclassified to prepaid customers to align with T-Mobile policy.(3) Customers associated with the Sprint wireless prepaid and Boost Mobile brands that were divested on July 1, 2020, have been excluded from our reported customers.(4) Customers who have rate plans with monthly recurring charges which are considered insignificant have been excluded from our reported customers.(5) Customers with postpaid phone rate plans without a phone (e.g., non-phone devices) have been reclassified from postpaid phone to postpaid other customers to align with T-Mobile policy.(6) Certain Sprint customers subject to collection activity for an extended period of time have been excluded from our reported customers to align with T-Mobile policy.(7) Miscellaneous insignificant adjustments to align with T-Mobile policy.39Table of ContentsNet Customer AdditionsThe following table sets forth the number of net customer additions:Year Ended December 31,2021 Versus 20202020 Versus 2019(in thousands)202120202019#%#%Net customer additionsPostpaid phone customers 2,917 2,218 3,121 699 32 %(903)(29)%Postpaid other customers2,578 3,268 1,394 (690)(21)%1,874 134 %Total postpaid customers5,495 5,486 4,515 9 NM971 22 %Prepaid customers342 145 339 197 136 %(194)(57)%Total customers5,837 5,631 4,854 206 4 %777 16 %Acquired customers, net of base adjustments818 29,228 (616)(28,410)(97)%29,844 NMNM - Not MeaningfulTotal net customer additions increased 206,000, or 4%, primarily from: •Higher postpaid phone net customer additions, primarily due to increased retail store traffic, compared to lower retail traffic in the prior period due to closures arising from the Pandemic, partially offset by higher churn; and•Higher prepaid net customer additions, primarily due to lower churn; partially offset by•Lower postpaid other net customer additions, primarily due to elevated gross additions in the prior period related to the public and educational sector resulting from the Pandemic and higher disconnects from an increased customer base, partially offset by growth in High Speed Internet. High Speed Internet net customer additions were 546,000 and 87,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.ChurnChurn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period further divided by the number of months in the period. The number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored within a certain period of time. We believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.

We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. Postpaid phone ARPU excludes postpaid other customers and related revenues, which include High Speed Internet, wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices such as tablets and SyncUp products.The following table illustrates the calculation of our operating measure ARPU and reconciles this measure to the related service revenues:(in millions, except average number of customers and ARPU)Year Ended December 31,2021 Versus 20202020 Versus 2019202120202019$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeCalculation of Postpaid Phone ARPUPostpaid service revenues$42,562 $36,306 $22,673 $6,256 17 %$13,633 60 %Less: Postpaid other revenues(3,408)(2,367)(1,344)(1,041)44 %(1,023)76 %Postpaid phone service revenues39,154 33,939 21,329 5,215 15 %12,610 59 %Divided by: Average number of postpaid phone customers (in thousands) and number of months in period68,327 59,249 38,602 9,078 15 %20,647 53 %Postpaid phone ARPU$47.75 $47.74 $46.04 $0.01 NM$1.70 4 %Calculation of Prepaid ARPUPrepaid service revenues$9,733 $9,421 $9,543 $312 3 %$(122)(1)%Divided by: Average number of prepaid customers (in thousands) and number of months in period20,909 20,594 20,955 315 2 %(361)(2)%Prepaid ARPU$38.79 $38.12 $37.95 $0.67 2 %$0.17 — %NM - Not MeaningfulPostpaid Phone ARPUPostpaid phone ARPU was essentially flat and was primarily impacted by:•Higher premium services, including Magenta Max; and•The net impact of customers acquired in the Merger, which have higher ARPU (net of changes arising from the reduction in base due to policy adjustments and reclassification of certain ARPU components from the acquired customers being moved to other revenue lines); offset by•Promotional activity; and•The impact of the transition of Sprint customers to tax-inclusive rate plans.Prepaid ARPUPrepaid ARPU increased $0.67, or 2%, primarily due to:•Higher premium services; and•Higher revenues due to improved rate plan mix; partially offset by •A reduction in certain non-recurring charges.42Table of ContentsAverage Revenue Per AccountAverage Revenue per Account (“ARPA”) represents the average monthly postpaid service revenue earned per account. We believe postpaid ARPA provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our postpaid service revenue realization and assist in forecasting our future postpaid service revenues on a per account basis. We consider postpaid ARPA to be indicative of our revenue growth potential given the increase in the average number of postpaid phone customers per account and increases in postpaid other customers, including High Speed Internet, wearables, DIGITS or other connected devices, which include tablets and SyncUp products.The following table illustrates the calculation of our operating measure ARPA and reconciles this measure to the related service revenues:(in millions, except average number of accounts, ARPA)Year Ended December 31,2021 Versus 20202020 Versus 2019202120202019$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeCalculation of Postpaid ARPAPostpaid service revenues$42,562 $36,306 $22,673 $6,256 17 %$13,633 60 %Divided by: Average number of postpaid accounts (in thousands) and number of months in period26,464 22,959 14,486 3,505 15 %8,473 58 %Postpaid ARPA$134.03 $131.78 $130.43 $2.25 2 %$1.35 1 %Postpaid ARPA increased $2.25, or 2%, primarily from:•An increase in customers per account; and•Higher premium services, including Magenta Max; partially offset by•Promotional activity.Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDABeginning in the first quarter of 2021, we began disclosing Core Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure to improve comparability as we de-emphasize device leasing programs as part of our value proposition.Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before Interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and certain income and expenses not reflective of our ongoing operating performance. Core Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA less device lease revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues. Core Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Core Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues.Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Core Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA as benchmarks to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications services companies because they are indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, stock-based compensation, Merger-related costs including network decommissioning costs and incremental costs directly attributable to the Pandemic, as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, as well as certain other nonrecurring income and expenses. Management believes analysts and investors use Core Adjusted EBITDA because it normalizes for the transition in the Company’s device financing strategy, by excluding the impact of device lease revenues from Adjusted EBITDA, to align with the exclusion of the related depreciation expense on leased devices from Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Core Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).43Table of ContentsThe following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:Year Ended December 31,2021 Versus 20202020 Versus 2019(in millions)202120202019$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeNet income$3,024 $3,064 $3,468 $(40)(1)%$(404)(12)%Adjustments:Income from discontinued operations, net of tax— (320)— 320 (100)%(320)NMIncome from continuing operations3,024 2,744 3,468 280 10 %(724)(21)%Interest expense3,189 2,483 727 706 28 %1,756 242 %Interest expense to affiliates173 247 408 (74)(30)%(161)(39)%Interest income(20)(29)(24)9 (31)%(5)21 %Other expense, net199 405 8 (206)(51)%397 4,963 %Income tax expense327 786 1,135 (459)(58)%(349)(31)%Operating income6,892 6,636 5,722 256 4 %914 16 %Depreciation and amortization16,383 14,151 6,616 2,232 16 %7,535 114 %Operating income from discontinued operations (1)— 432 — (432)(100)%432 NMStock-based compensation (2)521 516 423 5 1 %93 22 %Merger-related costs3,107 1,915 620 1,192 62 %1,295 209 %COVID-19-related costs— 458 — (458)(100)%458 NMImpairment expense— 418 — (418)(100)%418 NMOther, net (3)21 31 2 (10)(32)%29 1,450 %Adjusted EBITDA26,924 24,557 13,383 2,367 10 %11,174 83 %Lease revenues(3,348)(4,181)(599)833 (20)%(3,582)598 %Core Adjusted EBITDA$23,576 $20,376 $12,784 $3,200 16 %$7,592 59 %Net income margin (Net income divided by Service revenues)5 %6 %10 %-100 bps-400 bpsAdjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues)46 %49 %39 %-300 bps1000 bpsCore Adjusted EBITDA margin (Core Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues)40 %40 %37 %— bps300 bpsNM - Not Meaningful(1)Following the Prepaid Transaction starting on July 1, 2020, we provide MVNO services to DISH. We have included the operating income from April 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020, in our determination of Adjusted EBITDA to reflect contributions of the Prepaid Business that were replaced by the MVNO Agreement beginning on July 1, 2020 in order to enable management, analysts and investors to better assess ongoing operating performance and trends.(2)Stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree with stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, certain stock-based compensation expenses associated with the Transactions have been included in Merger-related costs. (3)Other, net may not agree with the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income primarily due to certain non-routine operating activities, such as other special items that would not be expected to reoccur or are not reflective of T-Mobile’s ongoing operating performance, and are, therefore, excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA. Core Adjusted EBITDA increased $3.2 billion, or 16%, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The components comprising Core Adjusted EBITDA are discussed further above. The increase was primarily due to:•Higher Total service revenues; and•Higher Equipment revenues, excluding Lease revenues; partially offset by•Higher Cost of equipment sales, excluding Merger-related costs;•Higher Cost of services, excluding Merger-related costs; and•Higher Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding Merger-related costs and supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related COVID-19 costs.44Table of ContentsAdjusted EBITDA increased $2.4 billion, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change was primarily due to the increase in Core Adjusted EBITDA, discussed above, partially offset by a decrease of Lease revenues of $833 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of debt and common stock, financing leases, the sale of certain receivables, financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms and the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). Further, the incurrence of additional indebtedness may inhibit our ability to incur new debt under the terms governing our existing and future indebtedness, which may make it more difficult for us to incur new debt in the future to finance our business strategy.Cash FlowsThe following is a condensed schedule of our cash flows:Year Ended December 31,2021 Versus 20202020 Versus 2019(in millions)202120202019$%$%Net cash provided by operating activities$13,917 $8,640 $6,824 $5,277 61 %$1,816 27 %Net cash used in investing activities(19,386)(12,715)(4,125)(6,671)52 %(8,590)208 %Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities1,709 13,010 (2,374)(11,301)(87)%15,384 (648)%Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities increased $5.3 billion, or 61%, primarily from:•A $4.8 billion decrease in net cash outflows from changes in working capital, primarily due to lower use of cash from Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Inventories, the one-time impact of $2.3 billion in gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps related to Merger financing for the year ended December 31, 2020, included in the use of cash from Other current and long-term liabilities, as well as lower use of cash from Operating lease right-of-use assets, partially offset by higher use of cash from Equipment installment plan receivables and Short- and long-term operating lease liabilities, including a $1.0 billion advance rent payment related to the modification of one of our master lease agreements; and•A $506 million increase in Net income, adjusted for non-cash income and expense.•Net cash provided by operating activities includes $2.2 billion and $1.5 billion in payments for Merger-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities increased $6.7 billion, or 52%.

Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps, are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management, investors and analysts of our financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business.In 2021 and 2019, we sold tower sites for proceeds of $40 million and $38 million, respectively, which are included in Proceeds from sales of tower sites within Net cash used in investing activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As these proceeds were from the sale of fixed assets and are used by management to assess cash available for capital expenditures during the year, we determined the proceeds are relevant for the calculation of Free Cash Flow and included them in the table below. Other proceeds from the sale of fixed assets for the periods presented are not significant. We have presented the impact of the sales in the table below, which reconciles Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps, to Net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.Year Ended December 31,2021 Versus 20202020 Versus 2019(in millions)202120202019$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeNet cash provided by operating activities$13,917 $8,640 $6,824 $5,277 61 %$1,816 27 %Cash purchases of property and equipment(12,326)(11,034)(6,391)(1,292)12 %(4,643)73 %Proceeds from sales of tower sites40 — 38 40 NM(38)(100)%Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions4,131 3,134 3,876 997 32 %(742)(19)%Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs(116)(82)(28)(34)41 %(54)193 %Free Cash Flow5,646 658 4,319 4,988 758 %(3,661)(85)%Gross cash paid for the settlement of interest rate swaps— 2,343 — (2,343)(100)%2,343 NMFree Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps$5,646 $3,001 $4,319 $2,645 88 %$(1,318)(31)%NM - Not MeaningfulFree Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps, increased $2.6 billion, or 88%.

Under the financing arrangement, we can effectively extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain vendors. As of December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding balances under such financing arrangement.46Table of ContentsWe also maintain vendor financing arrangements primarily with our main network equipment suppliers. Under the respective agreements, we can obtain extended financing terms. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repaid $184 million, associated with the vendor financing arrangements and other financial liabilities. These payments are included in Repayments of short-term debt for purchases of inventory, property and equipment and other financial liabilities, on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance under the vendor financing arrangements and other financial liabilities was $47 million and $240 million, respectively, of which $0 and $122 million, respectively, was assumed in connection with the closing of the Merger.We maintain a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with an aggregate commitment amount of $5.5 billion. As of December 31, 2021, there was no outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility.On October 30, 2020, we entered into a $5.0 billion senior secured term loan commitment with certain financial institutions. On January 14, 2021, we issued an aggregate of $3.0 billion of Senior Notes. The senior secured term loan commitment was reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds of the Senior Notes, which reduced the commitment to $2.0 billion. On March 23, 2021, we issued an aggregate of $3.8 billion of Senior Notes. The senior secured term loan commitment was terminated upon the issuance of the $3.8 billion of Senior Notes.Debt FinancingAs of December 31, 2021, our total debt and financing lease liabilities were $76.8 billion, excluding our tower obligations, of which $68.6 billion was classified as long-term debt and $1.5 billion was classified as long-term financing lease liabilities.During the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued long-term debt for net proceeds of $14.7 billion and redeemed and repaid short- and long-term debt with an aggregate principal amount of $11.3 billion.For more information regarding our debt financing transactions, see Note 8 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Spectrum AuctionsIn March 2021, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder of 142 licenses in Auction 107 (C-band spectrum) for an aggregate purchase price of $9.3 billion, excluding relocation costs. At the inception of Auction 107 in October 2020, we deposited $438 million. Upon conclusion of Auction 107 in March 2021, we paid the FCC the remaining $8.9 billion for the licenses won in the auction. We expect to incur an additional $1.0 billion in relocation costs which will be paid through 2024.In January 2022, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder of 199 licenses in Auction 110 (mid-band spectrum) for an aggregate purchase price of $2.9 billion. At the inception of Auction 110 in September 2021, we deposited $100 million. We paid the FCC the remaining $2.8 billion for the licenses won in the auction in the first quarter of 2022.For more information regarding our spectrum licenses, see Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Shentel Wireless Assets AcquisitionOn July 1, 2021, we closed on the acquisition of the Wireless Assets for a cash purchase price of approximately $1.9 billion. For more information regarding the acquisition of the Wireless Assets, see Note 2 – Business Combinations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have arrangements, as amended from time to time, to sell certain EIP accounts receivable and service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as a source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2021, we derecognized net receivables of $2.5 billion upon sale through these arrangements. For more information regarding these off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 4 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.47Table of ContentsFuture Sources and Uses of LiquidityWe may seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional debt in 2022, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other assets in private party transactions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. Excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions, or for other assets, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months as well as our longer-term liquidity needs. Our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of debt, tower obligations and the execution of our integration plan. We determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. We have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses to comply with the Government Commitments, and we are also expected to incur substantial restructuring expenses in connection with integrating and coordinating T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s businesses, operations, policies and procedures. See “Restructuring” of this MD&A. While we have assumed that a certain level of Merger-related expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control, including required consultation and negotiation with certain counterparties, could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. These expenses could exceed the costs historically borne by us and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. There are a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including those due to the impact of the Pandemic, that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment. The indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding financing leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers or borrowers and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to incur more debt, pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock, make certain investments, repurchase stock, create liens or other encumbrances, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit agreements, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the Issuers or borrowers to loan funds or make payments to Parent. However, the Issuers or borrowers are allowed to make certain permitted payments to Parent under the terms of each of the credit agreements, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of December 31, 2021.Financing Lease FacilitiesWe have entered into uncommitted financing lease facilities with certain partners that provide us with the ability to enter into financing leases for network equipment and services. As of December 31, 2021, we have committed to $6.3 billion of financing leases under these financing lease facilities, of which $1.2 billion was executed during the year ended December 31, 2021. We expect to enter into up to an additional $1.2 billion in financing lease commitments during the year ending December 31, 2022. Capital ExpendituresOur liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses, the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure and the integration of the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of T-Mobile and Sprint. Property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to the integration of our network and spectrum licenses, including acquired Sprint PCS and 2.5 GHz spectrum licenses and existing 600 MHz spectrum licenses as we build out our nationwide 5G network. We expect the majority of our remaining capital expenditures related to these efforts to occur in 2022, after which we currently expect a reduction in capital expenditure requirements.We expect cash purchases of property and equipment to range from $13.0 billion to $13.5 billion in 2022.For more information regarding our spectrum licenses, see Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.48Table of ContentsStockholder ReturnsWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.We may use excess cash to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to, among other things, approval by the Board of Directors and our sufficient access to sources liquidity, including potentially debt capital markets.Contractual ObligationsIn connection with the regulatory approvals of the Transactions, we made commitments to various state and federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and FCC. For more information regarding these commitments, see Note 17 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations and borrowings as of December 31, 2021, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods:(in millions)Less Than 1 Year1 - 3 Years4 - 5 YearsMore Than 5 YearsTotalLong-term debt (1)$5,597 $8,448 $10,866 $47,985 $72,896 Interest on long-term debt3,177 5,416 4,243 16,406 29,242 Financing lease liabilities, including imputed interest1,161 1,305 164 29 2,659 Tower obligations (2)415 630 626 329 2,000 Operating lease liabilities, including imputed interest3,868 8,083 6,314 17,387 35,652 Purchase obligations (3)4,679 5,595 2,145 1,572 13,991 Spectrum leases and service credits (4)350 611 591 4,706 6,258 Total contractual obligations$19,247 $30,088 $24,949 $88,414 $162,698 (1)Represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premiums, discounts, debt issuance costs, consent fees, and financing lease obligations. See Note 8 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.(2)Future minimum payments, including principal and interest payments, related to the tower obligations. See Note 9 – Tower Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.(3)The minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contracts. Termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due as of the earliest we could exit the contract, typically in less than one year. For certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. This table does not include open purchase orders as of December 31, 2021 under normal business purposes. See Note 17 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.(4)Spectrum lease agreements are typically for five to 10 years with automatic renewal provisions, bringing the total term of the agreements up to 30 years.Certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. Other long-term liabilities have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the lack of historical trends to predict future payments.The purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase spectrum licenses, wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we are contractually committed. Where we are committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether we take delivery, we have included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. The acquisition of spectrum licenses is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.Subsequent to December 31, 2021, on January 3, 2022, we entered into an agreement (the “Crown Agreement”) with Crown Castle International Corp that will enable us to lease towers from CCI through December 2033, followed by optional renewals. The Crown Agreement amends the pricing for our non-dedicated transportation lines, which includes lit fiber backhaul and small cell circuits. We have committed to an annual volume commitment to execute and deliver 35,000 small cell contracts, including upgrades to existing locations, over the next five years. The minimum commitment for small cells is $1.8 billion through 2039.49Table of ContentsRelated Party Transactions We have related party transactions associated with DT, SoftBank or their affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany servicing and licensing. See Note 19 – Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Disclosure of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2021, that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with either DT or SoftBank. We have relied upon DT and SoftBank for information regarding their respective activities, transactions and dealings.DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: Irancell Telecommunications Services Company, Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2021, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, provided basic telecommunications services to two customers in Germany identified on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List maintained by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control: Bank Melli and Europäisch-Iranische Handelsbank. These services have been terminated or are in the process of being terminated. For the year ended December 31, 2021, gross revenues of all DT affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic and telecommunications services with the Iranian parties identified herein were less than $0.4 million, and the estimated net profits were less than $0.4 million.In addition, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate a fixed-line network in their respective European home countries (in particular Germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the Embassy of Iran in those European countries. Gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 were less than $0.4 million. We understand that DT intends to continue these activities.Separately, SoftBank, through one of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, provides roaming services in Iran through Irancell Telecommunications Services Company. During the year ended December 31, 2021, SoftBank had no gross revenues from such services and no net profit was generated. We understand that the SoftBank subsidiary intends to continue such services. This subsidiary also provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to accounts affiliated with the Embassy of Iran in Japan. During the year ended December 31, 2021, SoftBank estimates that gross revenues and net profit generated by such services were both under $0.1 million. We understand that the SoftBank subsidiary is obligated under contract and intends to continue such services.In addition, SoftBank, through one of its non-U.S. indirect subsidiaries, provides office supplies to the Embassy of Iran in Japan. SoftBank estimates that gross revenue and net profit generated by such services during the year ended December 31, 2021, were both under $0.1 million. We understand that the SoftBank subsidiary intends to continue such activities.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition as they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Three of these policies, discussed below, are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.50Table of ContentsManagement and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies.DepreciationOur property and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. We record property and equipment at cost, and we generally depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. If all other factors were to remain unchanged, we expect that a one-year increase in the useful lives of our in-service property and equipment, exclusive of leased devices, would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $3.5 billion in our 2021 depreciation expense and that a one-year decrease in the useful life would have resulted in an increase of approximately $4.0 billion in our 2021 depreciation expense.See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 – Property and Equipment of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management’s underlying estimates of useful lives.Evaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for ImpairmentGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, are not amortized but tested for potential impairment annually, as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired.We test goodwill on a reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its book value. If the fair value exceeds the book value, then no impairment is measured. As of December 31, 2021, we have identified one reporting unit for which discrete financial information is available and results are regularly reviewed by management: wireless. The wireless reporting unit consists of all the assets and liabilities of T-Mobile US, Inc. When assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We employed a qualitative approach to assess the wireless reporting unit. The fair value of the wireless reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. We recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. In the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. We believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value. No events or change in circumstances have occurred that indicate the fair value of the wireless reporting unit may be below its carrying amount at December 31, 2021.We previously identified Layer3, which consisted of the assets and liabilities of Layer3 TV, Inc. and provided services branded as TVisionTM, as its own reporting unit. However, we wound down our TVisionTM services offering on April 29, 2021 and discrete financial information for Layer3 is no longer available or regularly reviewed by management. Accordingly, we no longer identify Layer3 as its own reporting unit as of December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, while Layer3 was still identified as its own reporting unit, we determined that our enhanced in-home broadband opportunity following the Merger, along with the acquisition of certain content rights, created a strategic shift in our TVisionTM services offering that indicated that the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the Layer3 reporting unit should be evaluated for impairment. As a result, we completed an interim goodwill impairment evaluation and determined the carrying value of the Layer3 reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment loss of $218 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, all of which relates to the impairment recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2020. This impairment reduced the goodwill balance previously assigned to the Layer3 reporting unit to zero. We test spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with our management of the overall business at anational level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitativeassessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. If the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their 51Table of Contentscarrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. We estimate fair value using the Greenfield methodology, which is an income approach, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The Greenfield methodology values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except for the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses) and makes investments required to build an operation comparable to current use. The value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. We base the assumptions underlying the Greenfield methodology on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. Future cash flows in the Greenfield methodology are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, EBITDA margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital. No events or change in circumstances have occurred that indicate the fair value of the Spectrum licenses may be below their carrying amount at December 31, 2021.The valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrumlicenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. If actual results or futureexpectations are not consistent with the assumptions used in our estimate of fair value, it may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. The most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures and long-term growth rate.For more information regarding our impairment assessments, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Income TaxesDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available.We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedFor information regarding recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to economic risks in the normal course of business, primarily from changes in interest rates, including changes in investment yields and changes in spreads due to credit risk and other factors. These risks, along with other business risks, impact our cost of capital. Our policy is to manage exposure related to fluctuations in interest rates in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term. We have established interest rate risk limits that are closely monitored by measuring interest rate sensitivities of our debt portfolio. We do not foresee significant changes in the strategies used to manage market risk in the near future.Certain potential sources of financing available to us, including our Revolving Credit Facility, bear interest that is indexed to LIBOR plus a fixed margin. As of December 31, 2021, we did not have outstanding balances under these facilities.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information.Services and ProductsWe provide mobile wireless communications services through a variety of service plan options. We also offer for sale to customers a wide selection of wireless devices, including smartphones, wearables, tablets, home broadband routers and other mobile communication devices that are manufactured by various suppliers. Our most popular service plan offering is Magenta Max, which allows customers to subscribe for wireless communications services separately from the purchase of a device. This plan includes unlimited talk, text and data on our network, 5G access at no extra cost, scam protection features and more. We also offer an Essentials rate plan for customers who want the basics at a lower price point, as well as specific rate plans to qualifying customers, including Business, Military and Veterans, First Responder, and Unlimited 55+. At the time of device purchase, qualified customers can finance all or a portion of the individual device or accessory purchase price over an installment period, generally of 24 months, using an equipment installment plan (“EIP”). For certain existing customers, devices are leased over an initial period of up to 18 months and may be upgraded when eligibility requirements are met.5Table of ContentsIn addition to our mobile wireless communications services, we offer High Speed Internet, which is a fixed wireless product that utilizes the excess capacity of our nationwide 5G network. Our fixed wireless product is available to millions of domestic households, providing an alternative to traditional landline internet service providers and expanding access to many people who have historically had only one choice or no access to traditional home broadband. With our High Speed Internet plan, customers can access the internet without worrying about annual service contracts, data overages or hidden fees. We also provide products and services that are complementary to our wireless communications services, including device protection, financial services, advertising and wireline communication services to domestic and international customers. In September 2022, we entered into an agreement for the sale of the Wireline Business. See Note 16 – Wireline for additional information.CustomersWe provide wireless communications services to a variety of customers needing connectivity, but focus primarily on two categories of customers: •Postpaid customers generally are qualified to pay after receiving wireless communications services utilizing phones, High Speed Internet, tablets, wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices; and•Prepaid customers generally pay for wireless communications services, including High Speed Internet, in advance. Our prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile.Our customer base includes consumers as well as business customers, who are provided services under the T-Mobile for Business brand.We provide Machine-to-Machine (“M2M”) and Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) customers access to our network. This access and the customer relationship are managed by wholesale partners, with whom we have commercial agreements permitting them to sell services utilizing our network. We generate the majority of our service revenues by providing wireless communications services to postpaid and prepaid customers. Our ability to attract and retain postpaid and prepaid customers is important to our business in the generation of service revenues, equipment revenues and other revenues. In 2022, our service revenues generated by providing wireless communications services by customer category were:•75% Postpaid customers;•16% Prepaid customers; and •9% Wholesale and other services.Substantially all of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were earned in the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Network StrategyUtilizing our multi-layer spectrum portfolio, our mission is to become “Famous for Network.” We have deployed low-band, mid-band and mmWave spectrum dedicated for 5G across our dense and broad network to create what we believe is America’s largest, fastest, most reliable and most awarded 5G network. The Merger greatly enhanced our spectrum position. Integration of the spectrum and network assets acquired in the Merger is expected to continue through 2023. Our integration strategy includes deploying the acquired spectrum on the combined network assets to supplement capacity, migrating Sprint customers to our network and optimizing the combined assets by decommissioning redundant sites. As of December 31, 2022, we have decommissioned substantially all targeted Sprint macro sites. As a result of the Merger, we have achieved, and expect to continue to achieve, significant synergies and cost reductions by eliminating redundancies within our network, as well as through other business processes and operations.6Table of ContentsSpectrum PositionWe provide wireless communications services utilizing low-band spectrum licenses covering our 600 MHz and 700 MHz spectrum, mid-band spectrum licenses, such as Advanced Wireless Services (“AWS”), Personal Communications Services (“PCS”) and 2.5 GHz spectrum, and mmWave spectrum.•We controlled, or expected to control based on previously announced auction results, an average of 388 MHz of combined low- and mid-band spectrum nationwide as of December 31, 2022.

We are the second largest provider of wireless communications services in the U.S. as measured by our total postpaid and prepaid customers. Our competitors include other national carriers, such as AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”) and Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”). In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller and regional carriers, MVNOs, including Comcast Corporation, Charter Communications, Inc., Altice USA, Inc. and DISH, many of which offer no-contract, postpaid and prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice, messaging and data services, using alternative technologies. Competitive factors within the wireless communications services industry include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies and regulatory changes. Some of our competitors have shown a willingness to use aggressive pricing or offer bundled services as a potential source of differentiation. 7Table of ContentsHuman CapitalEmployeesAs of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 71,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions.Attraction and RetentionWe employ a highly skilled workforce within a broad range of functions. Substantially all of our employees are located throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico, to serve our nationwide network and retail operations. Our headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington, and Overland Park, Kansas.We attract and retain our workforce through a dynamic and inclusive culture and by providing a comprehensive set of benefits, including:•Competitive medical, dental and vision benefits;•Family-building benefits designed to meet the diverse needs of our employees, including IVF and IUI, adoption and surrogacy benefits;•Annual stock grants to all full-time and part-time employees and a discounted Employee Stock Purchase Program;•A 401(k) Savings Plan;•Nationwide minimum pay of at least $20 per hour to all full-time and part-time employees;•LiveMagenta: a custom-branded program for employee engagement and well-being, including free access to life coaches, financial coaches and tools for healthy living;•Access to personal health advocates offering independent guidance;•A generous paid time off program, including paid family leave;•Tuition assistance for all full-time and part-time employees, including full tuition partnerships with multiple schools; and•A matching program for employee donations and volunteering.Training and DevelopmentCareer growth and development is foundational to T-Mobile’s culture and success. We want to deliver the best experiences from the best teams, and one way we do that is by offering an array of development programs and resources to build diverse talent and empower our people to succeed through every step of their career. It is all easily accessible on our Magenta University site, which is our one-stop shop for all things career development and learning. The online learning portal is designed to put employees in the driver’s seat and give them access to mentoring, training, videos, books, job search and interview tips, and much more. By strategically investing in the following three key areas of career development and learning, we are developing our talent now and for the future.•Evolve skills and careers – Learn every day, champion relentless improvement, develop critical skills, explore career possibilities, and build the desired career; •Advance leadership expertise – Build critical leadership capabilities, enable leadership growth at all levels, and develop skills to lead in the future; and•Champion diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) - Promote inclusive habits and behaviors, enhance belonging and connectedness, and advocate for equitable opportunities.Diversity, Equity and InclusionDE&I have always been a part of the Un-carrier culture, and we are committed to having DE&I touch every aspect of our future. Our Equity in Action Plan is a five-year plan that spans the values we live by, how we invest in and provide opportunities for our employees, how we select the suppliers we do business with and how we advocate for our communities.8Table of ContentsFor our employees, we have established six DE&I Employee Resource Groups and four sub-affinity groups that have helped us establish and maintain a culture of inclusion. Currently, we have over 45 DE&I chapters across the nation that help spearhead volunteer opportunities, events and meaningful conversation with employees at a local level. Our DE&I Employee Resource Groups include the following:•Accessibility Community at T-Mobile;•Multicultural Alliance;•Asia Pacific & Allies Network;•Black Empowerment Network;•Indigenous Peoples Network;•Magenta Latinx Network;•Multigenerational Network;•Pride;•Veterans & Allies Network; and•Women & Allies Network. As part of T-Mobile’s Equity In Action Plan and Promises, we have established an External Diversity and Inclusion Council in connection with our civil rights memorandum of understanding. The council includes civil rights leaders representing a wide range of underrepresented communities. Together with T-Mobile, the council will help identify ways to improve our efforts in focus areas such as corporate governance, workforce recruitment and retention, procurement, entrepreneurship, philanthropy and community investment. Since April 2020, we have achieved a significant portion of the Equity In Action Promises.As DE&I are instrumental to our culture and values, we are also on a mission to create fair and equitable opportunities for all suppliers, including veteran-owned, disability-owned, woman-owned, minority-owned, LGBT-owned and small and disadvantaged businesses. We have implemented a Supplier Diversity Category Management Strategy for our network technology procurement organization to help identify opportunities and develop actionable targets for progress on this topic.Environmental SustainabilityReducing Carbon FootprintWe are working to reduce the impact of our operations on the climate by setting carbon reduction goals that are aligned with science and investing in renewable energy. We are reducing our carbon footprint through several initiatives, including:•Setting a science-based net-zero target for 2040 that includes Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions;•Investing in renewable energy, as evidenced by our RE100 pledge, a global initiative that unites businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity. We first met this goal in 2021 and then again in 2022 by matching our electricity usage with renewable energy credits acquired through a variety of sources, including through our engagement in Virtual Power Purchasing Agreements and a Green Direct tariff agreement with nine clean energy providers for expected annual provision of approximately 3.5 million megawatt hours of renewable electricity; •Continuously testing and evaluating new, efficient equipment for our facilities, including switch stations, cell sites, retail stores and customer experience centers to reduce energy consumption; and•Promoting the circular economy through our device reuse and recycle program, which collects millions of devices for reuse, resale, and recycling annually.Responsible SourcingWe believe our suppliers are a valuable extension of our business and corporate values. Our Supplier Code of Conduct outlines expectations around ethical business practices for our suppliers. We require our suppliers to operate in full compliance with the laws, rules, regulations and ethical standards of the countries in which they operate or provide products or services. We expect our suppliers to share our commitment to ethical conduct and environmentally responsible business practices while they conduct business with or on behalf of us.We employ a third-party risk management (“TPRM”) process to screen for anti-corruption, global sanctions, human rights and environmental risks before engaging with a supplier. Our TPRM process also continuously monitors current suppliers for policy violations and risks.9Table of ContentsRegulationThe FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The FCC has a number of complex requirements that affect our operations and pending proceedings regarding additional or modified requirements that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911, 988 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly. Except for operations in certain unlicensed frequency bands, wireless communications services providers generally must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas, and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10-15 years depending on the particular licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority both to revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such noncompliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the FCC retains the right to modify rules related to use of licensed spectrum, which could impact T-Mobile’s ability to provide services.Additionally, Congress’s and the FCC’s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (“CMRS”), which includes cellular, PCS and other wireless services, could significantly increase and intensify competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses or our competitive position in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers’ spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers. Congress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership through an entity controlling the licensee. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest, but must be reviewed and approved. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our Company by DT.For our Educational Broadband Service (“EBS”) licenses in the 2.5 GHz band, FCC rules previously limited eligibility to hold EBS licenses to accredited educational institutions and certain governmental, religious and nonprofit entities, while permitting those license holders to lease up to 95% of their capacity for non-educational purposes. Therefore, we have historically accessed EBS spectrum primarily through long-term leasing arrangements with EBS license holders. Our EBS spectrum leases typically have an initial term equal to the remaining term of the EBS license, with an option to renew the lease for additional terms, for a total lease term of up to 30 years. On April 27, 2020, the FCC lifted the restriction on who can hold EBS licenses and the 30-year limitation on lease duration, among other changes. The elimination of these restrictions allows current license holders to sell their licenses, including to T-Mobile. While a majority of our leases have contractual provisions enabling us to match offers, we may be forced to compete with others to purchase 2.5 GHz licenses on the secondary market and expend additional capital earlier than we may have anticipated. T-Mobile has started to acquire some of these EBS licenses, but we continue to lease spectrum in this band and expect that to be the case for some time.While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communications services providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of devices while driving, service mapping, protection of consumer information, zoning and land use. Notwithstanding this federal preemption, several states are considering or have passed laws or regulations 10Table of Contentsthat could potentially set prices, minimum performance standards and/or restrictions on service discontinuation that could impact our business in those states.In addition, following the FCC’s adoption of the 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom (“RIF”) Order reclassifying broadband internet access services as non-common carrier “information services”, a number of states have sought to impose state-specific net neutrality, rate-setting, and privacy requirements on providers’ broadband services. The FCC’s RIF Order expressly preempted such state efforts, which are inconsistent with the FCC’s federal deregulatory approach. In 2019, however, the DC Circuit issued a ruling largely upholding the RIF Order, but also vacating the portion of the ruling broadly preempting state/local measures regulating broadband services. The court left open the prospect that particular state laws could still unlawfully conflict with the FCC RIF Order and be preempted; court challenges to some state enactments are pending.While most states pursuing net neutrality legislation are largely seeking to codify the repealed federal rules, there are differences in some states, notably California, which has passed separate privacy and net neutrality legislation, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia, which have passed privacy laws; and New York, which has passed a broadband rate-setting law. There are also efforts within Congress to pass federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirements. Ensuring the preemption of separate state requirements, including the California laws, is critical to this effort. If not preempted or rescinded, separate state requirements will impose significant business costs and could also result in increased litigation costs and enforcement risks. State authority over wireless broadband services will remain unsettled until final action by the courts or Congress.In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other federal agencies have jurisdiction over some consumer protection matters and the elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are, to some extent, unknown, and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.

The information on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC.Item 1A. Risk FactorsIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating T-Mobile. Our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results, as well as the price of our common stock and other securities, could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.Risks Related to Our Business and the Wireless Industry Competition, industry consolidation, and changes in the market for wireless communications services and other forms of connectivity could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We have multiple competitors that possess either more or different access to wireless assets, and yet we compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings, price, network coverage, speed and quality, and customer service. We expect the wireless industry’s customer growth rate to moderate over time in comparison with historical growth rates, leading to ongoing competition for customers. We also expect that our customers’ appetite for data services will place increasing demands on wireless service providers. This competition and increasing demands for data services will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies, including us, compete for a relatively fixed pool of customers with an ever-expanding variety of 11Table of Contentsproducts and services. Our ability to compete will depend upon, among other things, continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality, capacity and customer service, effective marketing and selling of products and services, innovation, and attractive pricing, all of which will involve significant expenses.We face increased competition from other service providers in the connectivity sector from within and outside of the wireless industry, including from cable, fiber and satellite providers, as industry sectors converge. Cable companies such as Comcast, Charter, and Altice are diversifying outside cable, voice and broadband services to also offer wireless services. Fiber companies such as Lumen Technologies and Windstream have announced plans for fiber buildouts, often supported by government funding. We expect DISH, which has already acquired several MVNOs, to build a wireless network and offer competitive postpaid and prepaid wireless service plans. Verizon and AT&T have refocused on connectivity services, including fiber builds and deployment of next generation wireless technology, and we expect both companies to increase competitive pressure, including by expanding partnerships and offerings. These factors could make it more difficult for us to continue to attract and retain customers, by adversely affecting our competitive position and ability to grow, including affecting our fixed wireless High Speed Internet growth plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.We have seen, and continue to expect, additional joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions, and strategic alliances in the converged connectivity sector, which could result in larger competitors competing for a limited number of customers. Further consolidation could negatively impact our businesses, including wholesale. For example, we have experienced and will continue to experience declining revenues from our wholesale business as Verizon migrates legacy TracFone customers off the T-Mobile network and DISH services more of its Boost Mobile customers with their standalone network. Our competitors may also enter into exclusive handset, device, or content arrangements, execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaigns, or otherwise improve their cost position relative to ours, making it more difficult for us to compete and negatively impacting our business. In addition, refusal of our competitors and partners to provide critical access to resources and inputs, such as roaming and/or backhaul services to us, on reasonable terms could negatively impact our business.We have experienced criminal cyberattacks and could in the future be further harmed by disruption, data loss or other security breaches, whether directly or indirectly through third parties.Our business involves the receipt, storage, and transmission of confidential information about our customers, such as sensitive personal, account and payment card information, confidential information about our employees and suppliers, and other sensitive information about our Company, such as our business plans, transactions, financial information, and intellectual property (collectively, “Confidential Information”). We are subject to persistent cyberattacks and threats to our networks, systems, and supply chain from a variety of bad actors, many of whom attempt to gain access to and compromise Confidential Information by exploiting bugs, errors, misconfigurations or other vulnerabilities in our networks and other systems (including purchased and third-party systems) or by engaging in credential harvesting or social engineering. In some cases, these bad actors may obtain unauthorized access to Confidential Information utilizing credentials taken from our customers, employees, or third parties. Other bad actors aim to cause serious operational disruptions to our business or networks through other means, such as through ransomware or distributed denial of services attacks. Cyberattacks against companies like ours have increased in frequency and potential harm over time, and the methods used to gain unauthorized access constantly evolve, making it increasingly difficult to anticipate, prevent, and/or detect incidents successfully in every instance. They are perpetrated by a variety of groups and persons, including state-sponsored parties, malicious actors, employees, contractors, or other unrelated third parties. Some of these persons reside in jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are ineffective or unavailable, and such attacks may even be perpetrated by or at the behest of foreign governments.In addition, we routinely provide certain Confidential Information to third-party providers whose products and services are used in our business operations, including as part of our IT systems, such as cloud services. These third-party providers have experienced in the past, and will continue to experience in the future, cyberattacks that involve attempts to obtain unauthorized access to our Confidential Information and/or to create operational disruptions that could adversely affect our business, and these providers also face other security challenges common to all parties that collect and process information.In August 2021, we disclosed that our systems were subject to a criminal cyberattack that compromised certain data of millions of our current customers, former customers, and prospective customers, including, in some instances, social security numbers, names, addresses, dates of birth and driver’s license/identification numbers. With the assistance of outside cybersecurity experts, we located and closed the unauthorized access to our systems and identified current, former, and prospective customers whose information was impacted and notified them, consistent with state and federal requirements. We have incurred certain cyberattack-related expenses, including costs to remediate the attack, provide additional customer support and enhance 12Table of Contentscustomer protection, and expect to incur additional expense in future periods resulting from the attack. For more information, see “Recent Cyberattacks” in the Overview section of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. As a result of the August 2021 cyberattack, we are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and regulatory inquiries, the ongoing costs of which may be material, and we may be subject to further regulatory inquiries and private litigation. For more information, see “– Contingencies and Litigation – Litigation and Regulatory Matters” in Note 19 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In January 2023, we disclosed that a bad actor was obtaining data through a single Application Programming Interface (“API”) without authorization. Based on our investigation to date, the impacted API is only able to provide a limited set of customer account data, including name, billing address, email, phone number, date of birth, T-Mobile account number and information such as the number of lines on the account and plan features. The result from our investigation to date indicates that the bad actor(s) obtained data from this API for approximately 37 million current postpaid and prepaid customer accounts, though many of these accounts did not include the full data set. We believe that the bad actor first retrieved data through the impacted API starting on or around November 25, 2022. We continue to investigate the incident and have notified individuals whose information was impacted consistent with state and federal requirements.As a result of the August 2021 cyberattack and the January 2023 cyberattack, we may incur significant costs or experience other material financial impacts, which may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, our cyber liability insurance, and such costs and impacts may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.In addition to the recent cyberattacks, we have experienced other unrelated immaterial incidents involving unauthorized access to certain Confidential Information. Typically, these incidents have involved attempts to commit fraud by taking control of a customer’s phone line, often by using compromised credentials. In other cases, the incidents have involved unauthorized access to certain of our customers’ private information, including credit card information, financial data, social security numbers or passwords, and to certain of our intellectual property. Our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to Confidential Information and to defend against cyberattacks seeking to disrupt our operations must be continually evaluated and enhanced to address the ever-evolving threat landscape and changing cybersecurity regulations. These preventative actions require the investment of significant resources and management time and attention. Additionally, we do not have control of the cybersecurity systems, breach prevention, and response protocols of our third-party providers. While T-Mobile may have contractual rights to assess the effectiveness of many of our providers’ systems and protocols, we do not have the means to know or assess the effectiveness of all of our providers’ systems and controls at all times. We cannot provide any assurances that actions taken by us, or our third-party providers, will adequately repel a significant cyberattack or prevent or substantially mitigate the impacts of cybersecurity breaches or misuses of Confidential Information, unauthorized access to our networks or systems or exploits against third-party environments, or that we, or our third-party providers, will be able to effectively identify, investigate, and remediate such incidents in a timely manner or at all. We expect to continue to be the target of cyberattacks, given the nature of our business, and we expect the same with respect to our third-party providers. If we fail to protect Confidential Information or to prevent operational disruptions from future cyberattacks, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, and operating results.If we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy.Significant technological changes continue to impact our industry. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to changes in available technology, continually invest in our network, increase network capacity, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings to meet our current and potential customers’ changing service demands. Enhancing our network, including the ongoing deployment of our 5G network, is subject to risks related to equipment changes and the migration of customers from older technologies. Negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, the perceived health risks relating to 5G networks could undermine market acceptance of our 5G services. Adopting new and sophisticated technologies may result in implementation issues, such as scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints, regulatory permitting issues, customer dissatisfaction, and other issues that could cause delays in launching new technological capabilities, which in turn could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the upgrades. If our new services fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with these services are higher than anticipated, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, brand, financial condition, and operating results.13Table of ContentsWe rely on highly skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture.The market for highly skilled workers and leaders is extremely competitive. We believe our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented personnel for all areas of our organization, including our CEO and the other members of our senior leadership team. Doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, changes to U.S. immigration policy, competitors’ hiring and remote working policies and practices, employee intolerance for the significant changes within, and demands on, our Company and our industry, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. If key employees depart or we are unable to recruit successfully, our business could be negatively impacted. Further, inflationary cost pressures may increase our costs, including employee compensation, and lead to increased employee attrition to the extent our compensation does not keep up with inflation, particularly if our competitors’ compensation does. In addition, certain members of our senior leadership team, including our CEO have term employment agreements with us. Our inability to extend the terms of these employment agreements or to replace these members of our senior leadership team at the end of their terms with qualified and capable successors could hinder our strategic planning and execution.In addition, the new hybrid work model introduced during the global COVID-19 pandemic (the “Pandemic”) required T-Mobile to change and evolve our company culture. As our culture continues to evolve, we may experience adverse impacts on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, as existing and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us. If key employees depart, our business could be negatively impacted. We may incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and replacing employees, and we may lose significant expertise and talent. As a result, we may not be able to meet our business plan, and our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.System failures and business disruptions may prevent us from providing reliable service, which could materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.We rely upon systems and networks - those of third-party suppliers and other providers, in addition to our own - to provide and support our service offerings. System, network, or infrastructure failures resulting from a number of causes may prevent us from providing reliable service. Examples of these risks include:•physical damage, power surges or outages, equipment failure, or other service disruptions with respect to both our wireless and wireline networks, including those resulting from severe weather, storms and natural disasters, which may occur more frequently or with greater intensity as a result of global climate change, public health crises, terrorist attacks, political instability and volatility and acts of war;•chronic changes in physical conditions, such as sea-level rise or changes in temperature or precipitation patterns, which may impact the operating conditions of our infrastructure or other infrastructure we rely on;•human error, such as responding to deceptive communications or unintentionally executing malicious code;•unauthorized access to our IT and business systems or to our network and critical infrastructure and those of our suppliers and other providers;•supplier failures or delays; and•system failures or outages of our business systems or communications network.Such events could cause us to lose customers and revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational damage, and subject us to fines, penalties, adverse actions or judgments, litigation, or governmental investigations. Remediation costs could include liability for information loss, costs of repairing infrastructure and systems, and/or costs of incentives offered to customers. Our insurance may not cover or may not be adequate to fully reimburse us for costs and losses associated with such events, and such events may also impact the availability of insurance at costs and other terms we find acceptable for future events.The scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum, and regulations relating to spectrum use, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We continue to deploy spectrum to expand and deepen our 5G coverage, maintain our quality of service, meet increasing customer demands, and deploy new technologies. In order to expand and differentiate from our competitors, we will continue to actively seek to make additional investment in spectrum, which could be significant.14Table of ContentsThe continued interest in, and acquisition of, spectrum by existing carriers and others, including speculators, may reduce our ability to acquire and/or increase the cost of acquiring spectrum in the secondary market, including leasing, or purchasing additional spectrum in the 2.5 GHz band, or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other means, including government auctions. Additionally, increased interest from third parties in acquiring spectrum may make it difficult to renew leases of some of our existing 2.5 GHz spectrum holdings in the future. Additionally, the FCC may not be able to provide sufficient additional spectrum to auction or we may be unable to secure the spectrum necessary to maintain or enhance our competitive position in any auction we may elect to participate in or in the secondary market, on favorable terms or at all. Any return on our investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customers and to provide additional services and usage to existing customers.The FCC, or other government entities, may impose conditions on the acquisition and use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas.If we cannot acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise, if competitors acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide services competitive with our services, or if we cannot deploy services over acquired spectrum on a timely basis without burdensome conditions, at reasonable cost, and while maintaining network quality levels, our ability to attract and retain customers and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.We are modernizing our billing system architecture for our customers. As part of this strategy, we are converting Sprint’s legacy customers onto T-Mobile’s billing platforms. As a result, we will operate and maintain multiple billing systems until such conversion is completed. Any unanticipated difficulties, disruption, or significant delays in either of these efforts could have adverse operational, financial, and reputational effects on our business.We are currently operating and maintaining multiple billing systems and supporting platforms. We expect to continue to do so until successful conversion of Sprint’s legacy customers to T-Mobile’s existing billing platforms. We may encounter unanticipated difficulties or experience delays in the ongoing integration efforts with respect to billing, causing major system or business disruptions. In addition, we or our supporting vendors may experience errors, cyber-attacks or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact us and over which we may have limited control. Interruptions and/or failure of these billing systems could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to provide or bill for our services, retain customers, attract new customers, or negatively impact overall customer experience. Any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition, and/or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and reputational damage.The challenges in satisfying the large number of Government Commitments in the required time frames and the significant cumulative cost incurred in tracking, monitoring, and complying with them over multiple years could continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results.In connection with the regulatory proceedings and approvals required to close the Transactions, we agreed to fulfill various Government Commitments. These Government Commitments include, among other things, extensive 5G network build-out commitments, obligations to deliver high-speed wireless services to the vast majority of Americans and marketing our in-home fixed wireless product to households where spectrum capacity is sufficient. Other Government Commitments relate to national security, pricing and availability of rate plans, employment, substantial monetary contributions to support several different organizations, and implementation of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Most Government Commitments have specified time frames for compliance and reporting, and we continue to focus on taking the actions required to fulfill them. Any failure to fulfill our obligations under these Government Commitments in a timely manner could result in substantial fines, penalties, or other legal and administrative actions and/or reputational harm.We expect to continue incurring significant costs, expenses, and fees to track, monitor, comply with and fulfill our obligations under these Government Commitments over a number of years. In addition, abiding by the Government Commitments may divert our management’s time and energy away from other business operations and could force us to make business decisions we would not otherwise make and forego taking actions that might be beneficial to the Company. The challenges in continuing to satisfy the large number of Government Commitments in the required time frames and the cost incurred in tracking, monitoring, and complying with them could also adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results and hinder our ability to effectively compete.15Table of ContentsEconomic, political and market conditions may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.Our business, financial condition and operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, unemployment rates, economic growth, energy costs, rates of inflation (or concerns about deflation), supply chain disruptions, impacts of current geopolitical instability caused by the war in Ukraine, and other macro-economic factors.The wireless industry, broadly, is dependent on population growth, as a result, we expect the wireless industry’s customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rates, leading to ongoing competition for customers. In addition, the Government Commitments place certain limitations on our ability to increase prices, which limits our ability to pass along growing costs to customers. Rising prices for goods, services, and labor due to inflation could adversely impact our margins and/or growth.Our services and device financing plans are available to a broad customer base, a significant segment of which may be vulnerable to weak economic conditions, particularly our subprime customers. We may have greater difficulty in gaining new customers within this segment, and existing customers may be more likely to terminate service and default on device financing plans due to an inability to pay.Weak economic and credit conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers, dealers, and wholesale partners or MVNOs, some of which may file for bankruptcy, or may experience cash flow or liquidity problems, or may be unable to obtain or refinance credit such that they may no longer be able to operate. Any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market, or sell our products and services.Our business may be adversely impacted if we are not able to successfully manage the ongoing commercial and transition services arrangements entered into in connection with the Prepaid Transaction and known or unknown liabilities arising in connection therewith.In connection with the closing of the Prepaid Transaction, we and DISH entered into certain commercial and transition services arrangements, including a Master Network Services Agreement (the “MNSA”) and a license purchase agreement (the “DISH License Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the MNSA, DISH will receive network services from the Company for a period of seven years. As set forth in the MNSA, the Company will provide DISH, among other things, (a) legacy network services for certain Boost Mobile prepaid end users on the Sprint network, (b) T-Mobile network services for certain end users that have been migrated to the T-Mobile network or provisioned on the T-Mobile network by or on behalf of DISH and (c) infrastructure mobile network operator services to assist in the access and integration of the DISH network. Pursuant to the DISH License Purchase Agreement, DISH has agreed to purchase all of Sprint’s 800 MHz spectrum (approximately 13.5 MHz of nationwide spectrum) for a total of approximately $3.6 billion in a transaction to be completed, subject to certain additional closing conditions, following an application for FCC approval to be filed three years following the closing of the Merger; provided, however, that if DISH breaches the DISH License Purchase agreement prior to the closing or fails to deliver the purchase price following the satisfaction or waiver of all closing conditions, DISH’s sole liability will be to pay us a fee of approximately $72 million. In such instance, T-Mobile is required, unless otherwise approved under the Consent Decree, to conduct an auction of all of Sprint’s 800 MHz spectrum under the terms set forth in the Consent Decree, but would not be required to divest such spectrum for an amount less than $3.6 billion. The parties are required to file an application for the transfer by April 1, 2023. The covered spectrum sale must occur within the later of three years after the closing of the Prepaid Transaction and five days after receipt of the approval from the FCC of the application.Failure to successfully manage these ongoing commercial and transition services arrangements entered into in connection with the Prepaid Transaction and liabilities arising in connection therewith may result in material unanticipated problems, including diversion of management time and energy, significant expenses and liabilities. There may also be other potential adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses, or liabilities associated with the Prepaid Transaction, the occurrence of which could materially impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, and operating results. In addition, there may be an increase in competition from DISH and other third parties that DISH may enter into commercial agreements with, who are significantly larger and with greater resources and scale advantages as compared to us. Such increased competition may result in our loss of customers and other business relationships.Any acquisition, divestiture, investment, or merger may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business.We may pursue acquisitions of, investments in or mergers with other companies, or the acquisition of technologies, services, products or other assets, that we believe would complement or expand our business. We may also elect to divest some of our 16Table of Contentsassets to third parties. Some of these potential transactions could be significant relative to the size of our business and operations. Any such transaction would involve a number of risks and could present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:•diversion of management attention from running our existing business;•increased costs to integrate the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the company involved in any such transaction with our business;•difficulties in effectively integrating the financial and operational systems of the business involved in any such transaction into (or supplanting such systems with) our financial and operational reporting infrastructure and internal control framework in an effective and timely manner;•potential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process or as a result of any litigation arising in connection with any such transaction;•significant transaction-related expenses in connection with any such transaction, whether consummated or not;•risks related to our ability to obtain any required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate any such transaction; and•any business, technology, service, or product involved in any such transaction may significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from the transaction, which could, among other things, also result in a write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with such transaction.For any or all of these reasons, as well as unknown risks, acquisitions, divestitures, investments, or mergers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We rely on third parties to provide products and services for the operation of our business, and the failure or inability of such parties to provide these products or services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We have a diverse set of suppliers to help us develop, maintain, and troubleshoot products and services such as wireless and wireline network components, software development services, and billing and customer service support. However, in certain areas such as, billing services, voice, and data communications transport services, wireless or wireline network infrastructure equipment, handsets, other devices, back-office processes and payment processing, there are a limited number of suppliers who can provide adequate support for us, which decreases our flexibility to switch to alternative third parties. Unexpected termination of our arrangement with any of these suppliers or difficulties in renewing our commercial arrangements with them could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations.Our suppliers are also subject to their own risks, including, but not limited to, economic, financial and credit conditions, labor force disruptions, geopolitical tensions, disruptions in global supply chain and the risks of natural catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and public health crises such as the Pandemic which may result in performance below the levels required by their contracts. Our business could be severely disrupted if critical suppliers or service providers fail to comply with their contracts or if we experience delays or service degradation during any transition to a new outsourcing provider or other supplier or if we are required to replace the supplied products or services with those from another source, especially if the replacement becomes necessary on short notice. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Further, some of our suppliers may provide services from outside of the United States, which carries additional regulatory and legal obligations. We rely on suppliers to provide us with contractual assurances and to disclose accurate information regarding risks associated with their provision of products or services in accordance with our policies and standards, including our Supplier Code of Conduct and our third-party risk management practices. The failure of our suppliers to comply with our expectations and policies could expose us to additional legal and litigation risks and lead to unexpected contract terminations. We may not fully realize the synergy benefits from the Transactions in the expected time frame. Our ability to realize the expected benefits from the Merger will depend on our ability to integrate the two businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the projected cost savings. Although we have completed a number of integration activities, we continue the process and may incur additional expenses as a result of challenges in combining operations such as: 17Table of Contents•difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including intellectual property and communications systems, administrative and information technology infrastructure, and supplier and vendor arrangements;•difficulties in operating and maintaining multiple billing and related support systems until conversion is completed;•difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;•compliance with Government Commitments relating to national security; and•other potential adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses or liabilities associated with the Transactions.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business flexibility, ability to service our debt, and increase our borrowing costs.We have, and we expect that we will continue to have, a substantial amount of debt. Our substantial level of indebtedness could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business, economic, market and industry conditions and increasing the amount of cash required to service our debt. In addition, this level of indebtedness may also reduce funds available for capital expenditures, any board-approved share repurchases and other activities. Those impacts may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Further, we may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, if any, which could increase the risks associated with our capital structure.Our ability to service our substantial debt obligations will depend on future performance, which will be affected by business, economic, market and industry conditions and other factors, including our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the Transactions. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations when due. If we are unable to meet such obligations or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing such debt obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices or make additional borrowings. We may not be able to, at any given time, refinance our debt, sell assets, or make additional borrowings on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Changes in credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to raise debt favorably.Instability in the global financial markets, inflation, policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, including changes in monetary policy and interest rates, and other general economic conditions could lead to volatility in the credit and equity markets. This volatility could limit our access to the capital markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.In addition, any hedging agreements we may enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations may not offer complete protection from these risks or may be unsuccessful, and consequently may effectively increase the interest rate we pay on our debt or the exchange rate with respect to any debt we may incur in a foreign currency, and any portion not subject to such hedging agreements would have full exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations, as applicable. If any financial institutions that are parties to our hedging agreements were to default on their payment obligations to us, declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, we would be unhedged against the underlying exposures. Any posting of collateral by us under our hedging agreements and the modification or termination of any of our hedging agreements could negatively impact our liquidity or other financial metrics. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financings include restrictive covenants that limit our operatingflexibility.The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financings impose operating and financial restrictions. These restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions and maintenance and incurrence-based financial tests, together with our debt service obligations, may limit our ability to engage in transactions and pursue strategic business opportunities. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain debt financing, refinance or pay principal on our outstanding indebtedness, complete acquisitions for cash or indebtedness or react to business, economic, market and industry conditions and other changes in our operating environment or the economy. Any future indebtedness that we incur may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our debt agreements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these and other agreements, giving our lenders the right to terminate the commitments they had made or the right to require us to repay all amounts then 18Table of Contentsoutstanding plus any interest, fees, penalties, or premiums. An event of default may also compel us to sell certain assets securing indebtedness under certain of these agreements.Credit rating downgrades and/or inability to access debt markets could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and operating results.Credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, as a result, cost of capital. Our current ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet our debt obligations. Our capital structure and business model are reliant on continued access to debt markets. Each rating agency reviews our ratings periodically, and there can be no assurance that such ratings will be maintained in the future. A downgrade in our corporate rating and/or our issued debt ratings could impact our ability to access debt markets and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and operating results.Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory MattersFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could result in a loss of investor confidence regarding our financial statements and reputational damage.Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we, along with our independent registered public accounting firm, are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. There can be no assurance that remediation of any material weaknesses that may be identified would be completed in a timely manner or that the remedial measures will prevent other control deficiencies or material weaknesses. If we are unable to remediate material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, then our ability to analyze, record and report financial information free of material misstatements, to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC and otherwise to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act would be negatively impacted. As a result, we may experience negative impacts to our business financial condition or operating results, which would restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require the expenditure of significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies, subject us to fines, penalties, investigations, or judgments, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in trading price of our stock and investor confidence.Changes in regulations or in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We are subject to regulatory oversight by various federal, state, and local agencies, as well as judicial review and actions, on issues related to the wireless industry that include, but are not limited to, roaming, interconnection, spectrum allocation and licensing, facilities siting, pole attachments, intercarrier compensation, Universal Service Fund, 911 services, consumer protection, consumer privacy, and cybersecurity. We are also subject to regulations in connection with other aspects of our business, including device financing and insurance activities.The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale, and interconnection of wireless communications systems, as do some state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and the resolution of issues of interference between operators in the same or adjacent spectrum bands. Changes necessary to resolve interference issues or concerns may have a significant impact on our ability to fully utilize our spectrum. As an example, we recently won spectrum licenses in the so-called “C band” to support our continued rollout of 5G technology and services. There have been concerns raised that use of this spectrum by wireless carriers for 5G deployment could interfere with the altimeters in certain aircraft, and there is an ongoing discussion between the industry, the FCC, and the FAA as to whether and how 5G operations should be limited around airports. Additionally, the FTC and other federal and state agencies have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection matters, and the elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of wireless products and services.We cannot assure that the FCC or any other federal, state, or local agencies will not adopt regulations, implement new programs, or take enforcement or other actions that would adversely affect our business, impose new costs, or require changes in current or planned operations, including timing of the shutdown of legacy technologies. For example, in response to the Pandemic, the California Public Utilities Commission adopted a resolution providing a moratorium on customer disconnects and late fees for certain California customers facing financial hardship. Additionally, in 2015 and 2016, the FCC established net neutrality and privacy regimes that applied to our operations. Both sets of rules potentially subjected some of our initiatives and practices to more burdensome requirements and heightened scrutiny by federal and state regulators, the public, edge providers, 19Table of Contentsand private litigants regarding whether such initiatives or practices are compliant. While the FCC rules were largely rolled back in December 2017, the current FCC updated transparency obligations to require nutrition-style broadband label disclosures effective potentially in 2023 that could prompt regulatory inquiries, and the FCC could decide to establish new net neutrality requirements. In addition, some states and other jurisdictions have enacted laws in these areas (including, for example, California and other states’ net neutrality laws, the CCPA and CPRA as discussed below) and others are considering enacting similar laws. It also is uncertain what rules may be promulgated under the current administration (e.g., the FTC has discussed promulgating privacy rules), perpetuating the risk and uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment and compliance around these issues.In addition, states are increasingly focused on the quality of service and support that wireless communications service providers provide to their customers and several states have proposed or enacted new and potentially burdensome regulations in this area. We also face potential investigations by, and inquiries from or actions by state public utility commissions. We also cannot assure that Congress will not amend the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, and which serves to limit state authority, or enact other legislation in a manner that could be adverse to our business.Failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We could be subject to fines, forfeitures, and other penalties (including, in extreme cases, revocation of our spectrum licenses) for failure to comply with the FCC or other governmental regulations, even if any such noncompliance was unintentional. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.Laws and regulations relating to the handling of privacy and data protection may result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage.In January 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) became effective, creating new data privacy rights for California residents and new compliance obligations for us and industry in general, in addition to private rights of action for certain types of data breaches. Moreover, new privacy laws are being developed and/or enacted in many jurisdictions, for example, in Colorado, Utah, Connecticut, Virginia, and in California, where the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) (which modifies the CCPA) recently became effective. All of these new privacy laws and others that we expect to be developed and enacted going forward will impose additional data protection obligations and potential liability on companies such as ours doing business in those states.We have incurred and will continue to incur significant implementation costs to ensure compliance with the CCPA, the CPRA, new privacy laws in other states, and their related regulations, including managing the complexity of laws that vary from state to state. Both federal and state governments are considering additional privacy laws and regulations which, if passed, could further impact our business, strategies, offerings, and initiatives and cause us to incur further costs. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with the CCPA, CPRA, other data privacy laws or regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, could lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, damages for contract breaches, and other significant costs, penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputation and market position.Unfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results. We and our affiliates are involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, investigations and proceedings, mass arbitrations and litigation matters. Such legal proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energy of management and other key personnel.In connection with the Transactions, we became subject to a number of legal proceedings, including a putative shareholder class action and derivative lawsuit and a putative antitrust class action. For more information, see “– Contingencies and Litigation – Litigation and Regulatory Matters” in Note 19 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is possible that stockholders of T-Mobile and/or Sprint may file additional putative class action lawsuits or shareholder derivative actions against the Company and the legacy T-Mobile board of directors and/or the legacy Sprint board of directors. Among other remedies, these stockholders could seek damages. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain and any such potential lawsuits could result in substantial costs and may be costly and distracting to management.Additionally, on April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed the contingencies and litigation matters of Sprint. Those matters include a wide variety of disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement 20Table of Contentsactions and other proceedings. Unfavorable resolution of these matters could require making additional reimbursements and paying additional fines and penalties.On February 28, 2020, we received a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Admonishment from the FCC, which proposed a penalty against us for allegedly violating Section 222 of the Communications Act and the FCC’s regulations governing the privacy of customer information. We recorded an accrual for an estimated payment amount as of March 31, 2020, which is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.As a result of the August 2021 cyberattack, we are subject to numerous lawsuits, including consolidated class action lawsuits seeking unspecified monetary damages, mass consumer arbitrations, a shareholder derivative lawsuit and inquiries by various government agencies, law enforcement and other governmental authorities, and we may be subject to further regulatory inquiries and private litigation. We are cooperating fully with regulators and vigorously defending against the class actions and other lawsuits. On July 22, 2022, we entered into an agreement to settle the consolidated class action lawsuit. On July 26, 2022, we received preliminary approval of the proposed settlement, which remains subject to final court approval. The court conducted a final approval hearing on January 20, 2023, and we await a ruling from the court. If approved by the court, under the terms of the proposed settlement, we would pay an aggregate of $350 million to fund claims submitted by class members, the legal fees of plaintiffs’ counsel and the costs of administering the settlement. We would also commit to an aggregate incremental spend of $150 million for data security and related technology in 2022 and 2023. In connection with the proposed class action settlement and other settlements of separate consumer claims that have been previously completed or are currently pending, we recorded a total pre-tax charge of approximately $400 million during the three months ended June 30, 2022. In light of the inherent uncertainties involved in such matters and based on the information currently available to us, we believe it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional losses associated with these proceedings and inquiries, and we will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. In addition, in connection with the January 2023 cyberattack, we have received notices of consumer class actions and regulatory inquires, to which we will respond to in due course. Ongoing legal and other costs related to these proceedings and inquiries, as well as any potential future proceedings and inquiries related to the August 2021 cyberattack and the January 2023 cyberattack, may be substantial, and losses associated with any adverse judgments, settlements, penalties or other resolutions of such proceedings and inquiries could be significant and have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.We, along with equipment manufacturers and other carriers, are subject to current and potential future lawsuits alleging adverse health effects arising from the use of wireless handsets or from wireless transmission equipment such as cell towers. In addition, the FCC has from time to time gathered data regarding wireless device emissions, and its assessment of the risks associated with using wireless devices may evolve based on its findings. Any of these allegations or changes in risk assessments could result in customers purchasing fewer devices and wireless services, could result in significant legal and regulatory liability, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.The assessment of the outcome of legal proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or pursuant to final judgment, order or decree may differ materially from amounts accrued in our financial statements. In addition, litigation or similar proceedings could impose restraints on our current or future manner of doing business. Such potential outcomes including judgments, awards, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.We offer regulated financial services products. These products expose us to a wide variety of state and federal regulations.The financing of devices, such as through our EIP, JUMP! On Demand or other leasing programs, such as those acquired in the Merger, has expanded our regulatory compliance obligations. Failure to remain compliant with applicable regulations may increase our risk exposure in the following areas:•consumer complaints and potential examinations or enforcement actions by federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, state attorneys general, the FCC and the FTC; and•regulatory fines, penalties, enforcement actions, civil litigation, and/or class action lawsuits.21Table of ContentsFailure to comply with applicable regulations and the realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Our business may be impacted by new or amended tax laws or regulations or administrative interpretations and judicial decisions affecting the scope or application of tax laws or regulations.In connection with the products and services we sell, we calculate, collect, and remit various federal, state, and local taxes, fees and regulatory charges (“tax” or “taxes”) to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including federal and state USF contributions and common carrier regulatory charges and public safety fees. As many of our service plans offer taxes and fees inclusive, our business results could be adversely impacted by increases in taxes and fees. In addition, we incur and pay state and local transaction taxes and fees on purchases of goods and services used in our business.Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the laws are issued or applied. In many cases, the application of existing, newly enacted or amended tax laws may be uncertain and subject to different interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services, such as broadband internet access and cloud-related services and in the context of our merger with Sprint. Legislative changes, administrative interpretations and judicial decisions affecting the scope or application of tax laws could also impact revenue reported and taxes due on tax inclusive plans. Additionally, failure to comply with any of the tax laws could subject us to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions.In the event that federal, state, and/or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes and regulatory or public safety charges on our network, operations, or services, or seek to impose new taxes or charges, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Our wireless licenses are subject to renewal and may be revoked in the event that we violate applicable laws.Our existing wireless licenses are subject to renewal upon the expiration of the period for which they are granted. Our licenses have been granted with an expectation of renewal and the FCC has approved our license renewal applications. However, the Communications Act provides that licenses may be revoked for cause and license renewal applications denied if the FCC determines that a renewal would not serve the public interest. If we fail to timely file to renew any wireless license or fail to meet any regulatory requirements for renewal, including construction and substantial service requirements, we could be denied a license renewal. Many of our wireless licenses are subject to interim or final construction requirements and there is no guarantee that the FCC will find our construction, or the construction of prior licensees, sufficient to meet the build-out or renewal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure that the FCC will renew our wireless licenses upon their expiration. If any of our wireless licenses were to be revoked or not renewed upon expiration, we would not be permitted to provide services under that license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockOur Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions and proceedings, which could limit the ability of our stockholders to obtain a judicial forum of their choice for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or employees.Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or employee of the Company to the Company or its stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Company's bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim arising under, in connection with, and governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision does not waive our compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Moreover, the provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.This choice of forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers and employees, even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could increase our costs of litigation and adversely affect our business and financial condition.22Table of ContentsDT controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock and the T-Mobile trademarks we utilize in our business, and may have interests that differ from the interests of our other stockholders.DT is a party to the SoftBank Proxy Agreement (as defined in Note 14 – SoftBank Equity Transaction to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, on June 22, 2020, DT, Claure Mobile LLC (“CM LLC”), and Marcelo Claure entered into a Proxy, Lock-up and ROFR Agreement (the “Claure Proxy Agreement” and together with the SoftBank Proxy Agreement, the “Proxy Agreements”). Pursuant to the Proxy Agreements, at any meeting of our stockholders, the shares of our common stock beneficially owned by SoftBank or CM LLC will be voted in the manner as directed by DT. In addition, DT holds direct and indirect call options that give DT the right to acquire up to approximately 35 million shares of our common stock held by SoftBank.Accordingly, DT controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock and therefore we are a “controlled company,” as defined in the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) listing rules, and we are not subject to NASDAQ requirements that would otherwise require us to have a majority of independent directors, a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors. Accordingly, our stockholders will not be afforded the same protections as stockholders of other NASDAQ-listed companies generally receive with respect to corporate governance for so long as we rely on these exemptions from the corporate governance requirements.In addition, pursuant to our Certificate of Incorporation and the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement, as long as DT beneficially owns 30% or more of our outstanding common stock, we are restricted from taking certain actions without DT’s prior written consent, including (i) incurring indebtedness above certain levels based on a specified debt to cash flow ratio, (ii) taking any action that would cause a default under any instrument evidencing indebtedness involving DT or its affiliates, (iii) acquiring or disposing of assets or entering into mergers or similar acquisitions in excess of $1.0 billion, (iv) changing the size of our board of directors, (v) subject to certain exceptions, issuing equity of 10% or more of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock, or issuing equity to redeem debt held by DT, (vi) repurchasing or redeeming equity securities or making any extraordinary or in-kind dividend other than on a pro rata basis, or (vii) making certain changes involving our CEO. We are also restricted from amending our Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws in any manner that could adversely affect DT’s rights under the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement for as long as DT beneficially owns 5% or more of our outstanding common stock. These restrictions could prevent us from taking actions that our board of directors might otherwise determine are in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, or that may be in the best interests of our other stockholders.DT effectively has control over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, changes to our Certificate of Incorporation, a sale or merger of our Company and other transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law. DT’s controlling interest may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, the Company and DT, as the controlling stockholder, may have strategic, financial, or other interests different from our other stockholders, including as the holder of a portion of our debt and as the counterparty in a number of commercial arrangements, and may make decisions adverse to the interests of our other stockholders.In addition, we license certain trademarks from DT, including the right to use the trademark “T-Mobile” as a name for the Company and our flagship brand under a trademark license agreement, as amended, with DT. As described in more detail in our Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on April 27, 2022 under the heading “Transactions with Related Persons and Approval,” we are obligated to pay DT a royalty in an amount equal to 0.25% (the “royalty rate”) of the net revenue (as defined in the trademark license) generated by products and services sold by the Company under the licensed trademarks subject to a cap of $80 million per calendar year through December 31, 2028. We and DT are obligated to negotiate a new trademark license when (i) DT has 50% or less of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or (ii) any third party owns or controls, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or otherwise has the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Company. If we and DT fail to agree on a new trademark license, either we or DT may terminate the trademark license and such termination shall be effective, in the case of clause (i) above, on the third anniversary after a notice of termination and, in the case of clause (ii) above, on the second anniversary after a notice of termination. A further increase in the royalty rate or termination of the trademark license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.23Table of ContentsFuture sales of our common stock by DT and SoftBank and foreign ownership limitations by the FCC could have a negative impact on our stock price and decrease the value of our stock.We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock by DT or SoftBank will have on the prevailing trading price of our common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline.We, DT and SoftBank are parties to the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement pursuant to which DT is free to transfer its shares in public sales without notice, as long as such transactions would not result in a third party owning more than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If a transfer were to exceed the 30% threshold, it would be prohibited unless the transfer were approved by our board of directors, or the transferee were to make a binding offer to purchase all of the other outstanding shares on the same price and terms. The Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement does not otherwise impose any other restrictions on the sales of common stock by DT or SoftBank. Moreover, the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement generally requires us to cooperate with DT to facilitate the resale of our common stock or debt securities held by DT under shelf registration statements we have filed. The sale of shares of our common stock by DT or SoftBank (other than in transactions involving the purchase of all of our outstanding shares) could significantly increase the number of shares available in the market, which could cause a decrease in our stock price. In addition, even if DT or SoftBank does not sell a large number of their shares into the market, their rights to transfer a large number of shares into the market could depress our stock price.Furthermore, under existing law, no more than 20% of an FCC licensee’s capital stock may be directly owned, or no more than 25% indirectly owned, or voted by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, by a foreign government or its representatives or by a foreign corporation. If an FCC licensee is controlled by another entity, up to 25% of that entity’s capital stock may be owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, by a foreign government or its representatives or by a foreign corporation. Foreign ownership above the 25% holding company level may be allowed if the FCC finds such higher levels consistent with the public interest. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest with respect to investors from certain nations. If our foreign ownership by previously unapproved foreign parties were to exceed the permitted level without further FCC authorization, the FCC could subject us to a range of penalties, including an order for us to divest the foreign ownership in part, fines, license revocation or denials of license renewals. If ownership of our common stock by an unapproved foreign entity were to become subject to such limitations, or if any ownership of our common stock violates any other rule or regulation of the FCC applicable to us, our Certificate of Incorporation provides for certain redemption provisions at a pre-determined price which may be less than fair market value. These limitations and our Certificate of Incorporation may limit our ability to attract additional equity financing outside the United States and decrease the value of our common stock.We cannot guarantee that our 2022 Stock Repurchase Program will be fully consummated or that our 2022 Stock Repurchase Program will enhance long-term stockholder value.Our Board of Directors has authorized our 2022 Stock Repurchase Program for up to $14.0 billion of the Company’s common stock through September 30, 2023, with $3.0 billion spent by the Company on share repurchases as of December 31, 2022, and an additional $2.1 billion spent by the Company from January 1, 2023 through February 10, 2023. Any additional share repurchases will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements, our results of operations and financial condition, our ability to access capital markets, our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes, the price of our common stock, and other factors that we may deem relevant. The existence of the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program could cause our stock price, in certain cases, to be higher or lower than it otherwise would be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity or have other unintended consequences for our stock. We can provide no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock at favorable prices, if at all. Although the program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance it will do so.In addition, the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock. The 2022 Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued, or the amount to be spent by the Company to repurchase shares could be reduced, at any time at the Company’s discretion. Any decision to reduce or discontinue repurchasing shares of our common stock pursuant to our 2022 Stock Repurchase Program could cause the market price for our common stock to decline and may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us. 24Table of ContentsItem 1B.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket InformationOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “TMUS.” We are included within the S&P 500 in the Wireless Telecommunication Services GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard) Sub-Industry index. As of January 31, 2023, there were 15,719 registered stockholders of record of our common stock, but we estimate the total number of stockholders to be much higher as a number of our shares are held by brokers or dealers for their customers in street name.We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to use future earnings, if any, to invest in our business and for general corporate purposes, including the continued build-out of our 5G network, expansion of our business, the integration of T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s businesses, and share repurchases as appropriate. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future; capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of potential gain.Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesThe table below provides information regarding our share repurchases during the three months ended December 31, 2022:(in millions, except share and per share amounts)Total Number of Shares PurchasedAverage Price Paid per ShareTotal Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or ProgramsApproximate Dollar Value of Shares that may yet be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1)October 1, 2022 - October 31, 20228,357,758 $138.04 8,357,758 $12,178 November 1, 2022 - November 30, 20223,307,350 148.26 3,307,350 11,687 December 1, 2022 - December 31, 20224,803,986 143.09 4,803,986 11,000 Total16,469,094 16,469,094 (1) On September 8, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized our 2022 Stock Repurchase Program for up to $14.0 billion of our common stock through September 30, 2023, with up to $3.0 billion by December 31, 2022.

[Reserved]27Table of ContentsItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewThe objectives of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) are to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with the following:•A narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results;•Context to the consolidated financial statements; and•Information that allows assessment of the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.Our MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our MD&A are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.Sprint Merger, Network Integration and Decommissioning ActivitiesTransaction OverviewOn April 1, 2020, we completed the Merger with Sprint, a communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services. As a result, Sprint and its subsidiaries became wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of T-Mobile.The Merger has altered the size and scope of our operations, impacting our assets, liabilities, obligations, capital requirements and performance measures. As a combined company, we have been able to enhance the breadth and depth of our nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation, increase competition in the U.S. wireless and broadband industries and achieve significant synergies and cost reductions by eliminating redundancies within the combined network as well as other business processes and operations.For more information regarding our Business Combination Agreement, see Note 2 – Business Combinations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Merger-Related CostsMerger-related costs associated with the Merger and acquisitions of affiliates generally include:•Integration costs to achieve efficiencies in network, retail, information technology and back office operations, migrate customers to the T-Mobile network and billing systems and the impact of legal matters assumed as part of the Merger;•Restructuring costs, including severance, store rationalization and network decommissioning; and•Transaction costs, including legal and professional services related to the completion of the transactions.Restructuring costs are disclosed in Note 20 – Restructuring Costs of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Merger-related costs have been excluded from our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, as we do not consider these costs to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance. See “Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA” in the “Performance Measures” section of this MD&A. Net cash payments for Merger-related costs, including payments related to our restructuring plan, are included in Net cash provided by operating activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.28Table of ContentsMerger-related costs are presented below:(in millions)Year Ended December 31,2022 Versus 20212021 Versus 2020202220212020$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeMerger-related costsCost of services, exclusive of depreciation and amortization$2,670 $1,015 $646 $1,655 163 %$369 57 %Cost of equipment sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization1,524 1,018 6 506 50 %1,012 NMSelling, general and administrative775 1,074 1,263 (299)(28)%(189)(15)%Total Merger-related costs$4,969 $3,107 $1,915 $1,862 60 %$1,192 62 %Net cash payments for Merger-related costs$3,364 $2,170 $1,493 $1,194 55 %$677 45 %NM - Not MeaningfulWe expect to incur substantially all of the remaining projected Merger-related costs of approximately $1.0 billion, excluding capital expenditures, by the end of 2023, with the cash expenditure for the Merger-related costs extending beyond 2023.We are evaluating additional restructuring initiatives which are dependent on consultations and negotiation with certain counterparties and the expected impact on our business operations, which could affect the amount or timing of the restructuring costs and related payments. We expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements and anticipated payments associated with the restructuring initiatives.Network IntegrationAs of December 31, 2022, we have decommissioned substantially all Sprint macro sites targeted for shut down. Our integration and decommissioning initiatives also included the acceleration or termination of certain of our operating and financing leases for cell sites, switch sites and network equipment. To achieve Merger synergies in network costs, we continue to perform rationalization activities to identify duplicative networks, backhaul services and other agreements, in addition to decommissioning certain small cell sites and distributed antenna systems.To allow for the realization of these synergies associated with network integration, we retired certain legacy networks, including the legacy Sprint CDMA network in the second quarter and the legacy Sprint LTE network in the third quarter of 2022. Customers impacted by the decommissioning of these networks have been excluded from our customer base and postpaid account base. See the “Performance Measures” section of this MD&A for more details.RestructuringUpon the close of the Merger, we began implementing restructuring initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from the Merger. The major activities associated with the restructuring initiatives to date include:•Contract termination costs associated with rationalization of retail stores, distribution channels, duplicative network and backhaul services and other agreements;•Severance costs associated with the reduction of redundant processes and functions; and•The decommissioning of certain small cell sites and distributed antenna systems to achieve Merger synergies in network costs. For more information regarding our restructuring activities, see Note 20 – Restructuring Costs of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.29Table of ContentsAnticipated Merger SynergiesAs a result of our ongoing restructuring and integration activities, we expect to realize Merger synergies by eliminating redundancies within our combined network (see “Network Integration” above) as well as other business processes and operations (see “Restructuring” above). For full-year 2023, we expect Merger synergies from Selling, general and administrative expense reductions of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion, Cost of service expense reductions of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion and avoided network expenses of $1.6 billion.WirelinePreviously, the operation of the legacy Sprint CDMA and LTE wireless networks was supported by the legacy Sprint Wireline network. During the second quarter of 2022, we retired the legacy Sprint CDMA network and began the orderly shut-down of the LTE network, which was completed during the third quarter. As a result of these actions during the second quarter of 2022, we determined that the retirement of the legacy Sprint CDMA and LTE wireless networks triggered the need to assess the Wireline long-lived assets for impairment, as these assets no longer support our wireless network and the associated customers and cash flows in a significant manner. The results of this assessment indicated that certain Wireline long-lived assets were impaired, and as a result, we recorded non-cash impairment expense of $477 million related to Wireline Property and equipment, Operating lease right-of-use assets and Other intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2022, all of which relates to the impairment recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2022. We continue to provide Wireline services to existing Wireline customers as of December 31, 2022.For more information regarding this non-cash impairment, see Note 16 – Wireline of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.On September 6, 2022, we entered into the Wireline Sale Agreement to sell the Wireline Business for a total purchase price of $1. In addition, at the consummation of the Wireline Transaction, we will enter into an agreement for IP transit services for $700 million. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions and the other terms and conditions of the Wireline Sale Agreement, the Wireline Transaction is expected to close mid-year 2023. As a result of the Wireline Sale Agreement and related anticipated Wireline Transaction, we concluded that the Wireline Business met the held for sale criteria upon entering into the Wireline Sale Agreement. As such, the assets and liabilities of the Wireline Business disposal group are classified as held for sale and presented within Other current assets and Other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022. In connection with the expected sale of the Wireline Business and classification of related assets and liabilities as held for sale, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022, which is included within Loss on disposal group held for sale on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The fair value of the Wireline Business disposal group, less costs to sell, will be reassessed during each subsequent reporting period it remains classified as held for sale, and any remeasurement to the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell will be reported as an adjustment to the Loss on disposal group held for sale.For more information regarding the Wireline Sale Agreement, see Note 16 – Wireline of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Recent CyberattacksIn August 2021, we were subject to a criminal cyberattack involving unauthorized access to T-Mobile’s systems. As a result of the attack, we are subject to numerous arbitration demands and lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, and regulatory inquiries as described in Note 19 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In connection with the proposed class action settlement and the separate settlements reached with a number of consumers, we recorded a total pre-tax charge of approximately $400 million during the three months ended June 30, 2022. We expect to continue to incur additional expenses in future periods, including costs to remediate the attack, resolve inquiries by various government authorities, provide additional customer support and enhance customer protection, only some of which may be covered and reimbursable by insurance. In addition to the committed aggregate incremental spend of $150 million for data security and related technology in 2022 and 2023 under the proposed settlement agreement, we intend to allocate substantial additional resources towards cybersecurity initiatives over the next several years.During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $100 million in reimbursements from insurance carriers for costs incurred related to the August 2021 cyberattack. We are pursuing additional reimbursements from insurance carriers for costs incurred related to the August 2021 cyberattack.30Table of ContentsIn January 2023, we disclosed that a bad actor was obtaining data through a single Application Programming Interface (“API”) without authorization. Based on our investigation to date, the impacted API is only able to provide a limited set of customer account data, including name, billing address, email, phone number, date of birth, T-Mobile account number and information such as the number of lines on the account and plan features. The result from our investigation to date indicates that the bad actor(s) obtained data from this API for approximately 37 million current postpaid and prepaid customer accounts, though many of these accounts did not include the full data set. We believe that the bad actor first retrieved data through the impacted API starting on or around November 25, 2022. We continue to investigate the incident and have notified individuals whose information was impacted consistent with state and federal requirements.We will respond to litigation and regulatory inquiries in connection with this incident and may incur significant expenses. However, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any of these potential matters, or whether we may be subject to regulatory inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions. In addition, we are unable to predict the full impact of this incident on customer behavior in the future, including whether a change in our customers’ behavior could negatively impact our results of operations on an ongoing basis, although we presently do not expect that it will have a material effect on our operations.Additionally, following the August 2021 cyberattack, we commenced a substantial multi-year investment working with leading external cybersecurity experts to enhance our cybersecurity capabilities and transform our approach to cybersecurity. While we have made progress to date, we plan to continue to make substantial investments to strengthen our cybersecurity program in future periods.Revenue TrendsIn 2023, we expect Service revenues to continue to grow, primarily due to continued postpaid account and customer growth as well as Postpaid Average Revenue per Account (“postpaid ARPA”) growth driven by the execution of our strategy to continuously deepen our account relationships, including growth in High Speed Internet. We expect the increase in postpaid service revenues to be partially offset by a decrease in Wholesale and other service revenues, primarily driven by the sale of the Wireline business, which is expected to close mid-2023, the migration by Verizon of legacy TracFone customers off of the T-Mobile network and as DISH services more of its Boost customers with their standalone network. We also expect lower lease revenues as a result of the continued strategic shift in device financing from leasing to EIP.Operating Expense TrendsIn 2023, we expect Total operating expenses to decrease, primarily due to continued synergy realization benefiting Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative expense as well as a significant decrease in Merger-related costs from $5.0 billion in 2022 to approximately $1.0 billion expected in 2023 as the majority of our integration activities have been completed. We further expect a decrease in operating expenses, primarily Cost of services, associated with serving Wireline customers driven by the sale of the Wireline business which is expected to close mid-2023. The trend of decreasing depreciation on leased devices is expected to continue as a result of the continued strategic shift in device financing from leasing to EIP.Macroeconomic TrendsMacroeconomic trends may result in adverse impacts on our business, and we continue to monitor these potential impacts, including potential economic recession, changes in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, as well as geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine. Such scenarios and uncertainties may affect, among others, expected credit loss activity as well as certain fair value estimates. To date, price inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations as we have fixed rates established through long-term contracts for many of our most significant costs, including tower agreements and backhaul contracts. Similarly, our exposure to the impact of rising interest rates is limited, primarily to any new debt issuances or draws on our revolving credit facility, as interest is paid on our Senior Notes at a fixed rate. We continue to monitor the impact of these trends on the payment performance of our customers.Inflation Reduction ActOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) into law. The IRA includes several changes to existing tax law, including a minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income of applicable corporations and an excise tax on certain corporate stock buybacks. The tax provisions included in the IRA are generally effective beginning January 1, 2023, and had no significant impact to the 2022 consolidated financial statements. Management does not expect the IRA to have a significant impact on our operating results or cash flows in 2023, and we continue to review the IRA tax provisions to assess impacts to our future consolidated financial statements.31Table of ContentsResults of OperationsSet forth below is a summary of our consolidated financial results:Year Ended December 31,2022 Versus 20212021 Versus 2020(in millions)202220212020$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeRevenuesPostpaid revenues$45,919 $42,562 $36,306 $3,357 8 %$6,256 17 %Prepaid revenues9,857 9,733 9,421 124 1 %312 3 %Wholesale and other service revenues5,547 6,074 4,668 (527)(9)%1,406 30 %Total service revenues61,323 58,369 50,395 2,954 5 %7,974 16 %Equipment revenues17,130 20,727 17,312 (3,597)(17)%3,415 20 %Other revenues1,118 1,022 690 96 9 %332 48 %Total revenues79,571 80,118 68,397 (547)(1)%11,721 17 %Operating expensesCost of services, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below14,666 13,934 11,878 732 5 %2,056 17 %Cost of equipment sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below21,540 22,671 16,388 (1,131)(5)%6,283 38 %Selling, general and administrative21,607 20,238 18,926 1,369 7 %1,312 7 %Impairment expense477 — 418 477 NM(418)(100)%Loss on disposal group held for sale1,087 — — 1,087 NM— NMDepreciation and amortization13,651 16,383 14,151 (2,732)(17)%2,232 16 %Total operating expenses73,028 73,226 61,761 (198)— %11,465 19 %Operating income6,543 6,892 6,636 (349)(5)%256 4 %Other expense, netInterest expense, net(3,364)(3,342)(2,701)(22)1 %(641)24 %Other expense, net(33)(199)(405)166 (83)%206 (51)%Total other expense, net(3,397)(3,541)(3,106)144 (4)%(435)14 %Income before income taxes3,146 3,351 3,530 (205)(6)%(179)(5)%Income tax expense(556)(327)(786)(229)70 %459 (58)%Income from continuing operations2,590 3,024 2,744 (434)(14)%280 10 %Income from discontinued operations, net of tax— — 320 — NM(320)(100)%Net income$2,590 $3,024 $3,064 $(434)(14)%$(40)(1)%Statement of Cash Flows DataNet cash provided by operating activities$16,781 $13,917 $8,640 $2,864 21 %$5,277 61 %Net cash used in investing activities(12,359)(19,386)(12,715)7,027 (36)%(6,671)52 %Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities(6,451)1,709 13,010 (8,160)(477)%(11,301)(87)%Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA$27,821 $26,924 $24,557 $897 3 %$2,367 10 %Core Adjusted EBITDA26,391 23,576 20,376 2,815 12 %3,200 16 %Free Cash Flow7,656 5,6463,0012,01036 %2,64588 %NM - Not Meaningful32Table of ContentsThe following discussion and analysis is for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021 unless otherwise stated.

(“Sprint Communications”) and Sprint Capital Corporation (collectively, the “Sprint Issuers”). As of December 31, 2022, all the registered debt to third parties issued by Sprint Communications had matured and Sprint Communications no longer has any such debt outstanding.Pursuant to the applicable indentures and supplemental indentures, the Senior Notes to affiliates and third parties issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc. and the Sprint Issuers (collectively, the “Issuers”) are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile (“Parent”) and certain of Parent’s 100% owned subsidiaries (“Guarantor Subsidiaries”). The guarantees of the Guarantor Subsidiaries are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. Generally, the guarantees of the Guarantor Subsidiaries with respect to the Senior Notes issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc. (other than $3.5 billion in principal amount of Senior Notes issued in 2017 and 2018) and the credit agreement entered into by T-Mobile USA, Inc. will be automatically and unconditionally released if, immediately following such release and any concurrent releases of other guarantees, the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness of non-guarantor subsidiaries (other than certain specified subsidiaries) would not exceed $2.0 billion. The indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements governing the long-term debt contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers or borrowers and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to incur more debt, create liens or other encumbrances, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets.

High Speed Internet net customer additions included in prepaid net customer additions were 236,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our prepaid High Speed Internet launch was in the first quarter of 2022. Therefore, there were no prepaid High Speed Internet net customer additions for the year ended December 31, 2021.ChurnChurn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period further divided by the number of months in the period. The number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently had their service restored within a certain period of time and excludes customers who received service for less than a certain minimum period of time. We believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty. The following table sets forth the churn:Year Ended December 31,Bps Change 2022 Versus 2021Bps Change 2021 Versus 2020202220212020Postpaid phone churn0.88 %0.98 %0.90 %-10 bps8 bpsPrepaid churn2.77 %2.83 %3.03 %-6 bps-20 bpsPostpaid phone churn decreased 10 basis points, primarily from:•Reduced Sprint churn as we progress through the integration process; partially offset by•More normalized payment performance relative to muted Pandemic levels in 2021. Prepaid churn decreased 6 basis points, primarily from:•Promotional activity; partially offset by•More normalized payment performance relative to muted Pandemic levels in 2021. Postpaid Average Revenue Per AccountPostpaid ARPA represents the average monthly postpaid service revenue earned per account. Postpaid ARPA is calculated as Postpaid revenues for the specified period divided by the average number of postpaid accounts during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period. We believe postpaid ARPA provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our postpaid service revenue realization and assist in forecasting our future postpaid service revenues on a per account basis. We consider postpaid ARPA to be indicative of our revenue growth potential given the increase in the average number of postpaid phone customers per account and increases in postpaid other customers, including High Speed Internet, tablets, wearables, DIGITS or other connected devices.The following table sets forth our operating measure ARPA:(in dollars)Year Ended December 31,2022 Versus 20212021 Versus 2020202220212020$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangePostpaid ARPA$137.43 $134.03 $131.78 $3.40 3 %$2.25 2 %40Table of ContentsPostpaid ARPA increased $3.40, or 3%, primarily from:•Higher premium services, including Magenta Max;•Higher non-recurring charges relative to muted Pandemic levels in 2021; and•An increase in customers per account, including continued adoption of High Speed Internet from existing accounts; partially offset by•An increase in High Speed Internet only accounts and increased promotional activity, including growth in rate plans for specific customer cohorts such as Business, Military, and First Responder.Average Revenue Per UserAverage Revenue per User (“ARPU”) represents the average monthly service revenue earned per customer. ARPU is calculated as service revenues for the specified period divided by the average number of customers during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period. We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. Postpaid phone ARPU excludes postpaid other customers and related revenues, which include High Speed Internet, tablets, wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices.The following table sets forth our operating measure ARPU:(in dollars)Year Ended December 31,2022 Versus 20212021 Versus 2020202220212020$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangePostpaid phone ARPU$48.78 $47.75 $47.74 $1.03 2 %$0.01 — %Prepaid ARPU38.76 38.79 38.12 (0.03)— %0.67 2 %Postpaid Phone ARPUPostpaid phone ARPU increased $1.03, or 2%, primarily due to:•Higher premium services, including Magenta Max; and•Higher non-recurring charges relative to muted Pandemic levels in 2021; partially offset by •Increased promotional activity, including growth in rate plans for specific customer cohorts such as Business, Military, and First Responder.Prepaid ARPUPrepaid ARPU was essentially flat, primarily from:•Increased promotional activity; offset by •Higher premium services; and•Higher non-recurring charges.Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA represents earnings before Interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and certain income and expenses not reflective of our ongoing operating performance. Core Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA less device lease revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues. Core Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Core Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues.Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Core Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. We historically used Adjusted EBITDA and we currently use Core Adjusted EBITDA internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA as benchmarks to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures to evaluate overall operating performance and to facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications services companies because they are indicative of our ongoing 41Table of Contentsoperating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, stock-based compensation, Merger-related costs, including network decommissioning costs, impairment expense, losses on disposal groups held for sale and certain legal-related recoveries and expenses, as well as other special income and expenses which are not reflective of our core business activities. Management believes analysts and investors use Core Adjusted EBITDA because it normalizes for the transition in the Company’s device financing strategy, by excluding the impact of device lease revenues from Adjusted EBITDA, to align with the exclusion of the related depreciation expense on leased devices from Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Core Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.The following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:Year Ended December 31,2022 Versus 20212021 Versus 2020(in millions)202220212020$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeNet income$2,590 $3,024 $3,064 $(434)(14)%$(40)(1)%Adjustments:Income from discontinued operations, net of tax— — (320)— NM320 (100)%Income from continuing operations2,590 3,024 2,744 (434)(14)%280 10 %Interest expense, net3,364 3,342 2,701 22 1 %641 24 %Other expense, net33 199 405 (166)(83)%(206)(51)%Income tax expense556 327 786 229 70 %(459)(58)%Operating income6,543 6,892 6,636 (349)(5)%256 4 %Depreciation and amortization13,651 16,383 14,151 (2,732)(17)%2,232 16 %Operating income from discontinued operations (1)— — 432 — NM(432)(100)%Stock-based compensation (2)576 521 516 55 11 %5 1 %Merger-related costs4,969 3,107 1,915 1,862 60 %1,192 62 %COVID-19-related costs— — 458 — NM(458)(100)%Impairment expense477 — 418 477 NM(418)(100)%Legal-related expenses, net (3)391 — — 391 NM— NMLoss on disposal group held for sale1,087 — — 1,087 NM— NMOther, net (4)127 21 31 106 505 %(10)(32)%Adjusted EBITDA27,821 26,924 24,557 897 3 %2,367 10 %Lease revenues(1,430)(3,348)(4,181)1,918 (57)%833 (20)%Core Adjusted EBITDA$26,391 $23,576 $20,376 $2,815 12 %$3,200 16 %Net income margin (Net income divided by Service revenues)4 %5 %6 %-100 bps-100 bpsAdjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues)45 %46 %49 %-100 bps-300 bpsCore Adjusted EBITDA margin (Core Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues)43 %40 %40 %300 bps— bps(1)Following the Prepaid Transaction starting on July 1, 2020, we provide MVNO services to DISH.

Additionally, certain stock-based compensation expenses associated with the Transactions have been included in Merger-related costs. (3)Legal-related expenses, net, consists of the settlement of certain litigation associated with the August 2021 cyberattack and is presented net of insurance recoveries.(4)Other, net, primarily consists of certain severance, restructuring and other expenses and income, including gains from the sale of IP addresses, not directly attributable to the Merger which are not reflective of T-Mobile’s core business activities (“special items”), and are, therefore, excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA. NM - Not meaningfulCore Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.8 billion, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The components comprising Core Adjusted EBITDA are discussed further above. 42Table of ContentsThe increase was primarily due to:•Higher Total service revenues;•Lower Cost of equipment sales, excluding Merger-related costs; and •Lower Cost of services, excluding Merger-related costs; partially offset by•Lower Equipment revenues, excluding lease revenues; and•Higher Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding Merger-related costs, certain legal-related expenses, net of recoveries, and other special items, such as gains from the sale of IP addresses.Adjusted EBITDA increased $897 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the fluctuations in Core Adjusted EBITDA, discussed above, partially offset by lower lease revenues, which decreased $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of debt, financing leases, the sale of certain receivables and the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). Further, the incurrence of additional indebtedness may inhibit our ability to incur new debt in the future to finance our business strategy under the terms governing our existing and future indebtedness.Cash FlowsThe following is a condensed schedule of our cash flows:Year Ended December 31,2022 Versus 20212021 Versus 2020(in millions)202220212020$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeNet cash provided by operating activities$16,781 $13,917 $8,640 $2,864 21 %$5,277 61 %Net cash used in investing activities(12,359)(19,386)(12,715)7,027 (36)%(6,671)52 %Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities(6,451)1,709 13,010 (8,160)(477)%(11,301)(87)%Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities increased $2.9 billion, or 21%, primarily from:•A $4.1 billion decrease in net cash outflows from changes in working capital, primarily due to lower use of cash from Short- and long-term operating lease liabilities, including the impact of a $1.0 billion advance rent payment related to the modification of one of our master lease agreements during the year ended December 31, 2021, EIP receivables, Other current and long-term liabilities and Inventories, partially offset by higher use of cash from Accounts receivable; partially offset by•A $1.2 billion decrease in Net income, adjusted for non-cash income and expense.•Net cash provided by operating activities includes the impact of $3.4 billion and $2.2 billion in net payments for Merger-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities decreased $7.0 billion or 36%. The use of cash was primarily from:•$14.0 billion in Purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, from the accelerated build-out of our nationwide 5G network, including from network integration related to the Merger; and•$3.3 billion in Purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits, primarily due to $2.8 billion paid for spectrum licenses won at the conclusion of Auction 110 in February 2022 and $304 million paid in total for spectrum licenses won at the conclusion of Auction 108 in September 2022; partially offset by •$4.8 billion in Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions.43Table of ContentsFinancing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities was $6.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The use of cash was primarily from:•$5.6 billion in Repayments of long-term debt;•$3.0 billion in Repurchases of common stock;•$1.2 billion in Repayments of financing lease obligations; and•$243 million in Tax withholdings on share-based awards; partially offset by•$3.7 billion in Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt.Cash and Cash EquivalentsAs of December 31, 2022, our Cash and cash equivalents were $4.5 billion compared to $6.6 billion at December 31, 2021.Free Cash FlowFree Cash Flow represents Net cash provided by operating activities less cash payments for Purchases of property and equipment, including Proceeds from sales of tower sites and Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions and less Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by management, investors and analysts of our financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt, repurchase shares and provide further investment in the business.In 2022 and 2021, we received proceeds from the sale of tower sites of $9 million and $40 million, respectively, which are included in Proceeds from sales of tower sites within Net cash used in investing activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As these proceeds were from the sale of fixed assets and are used by management to assess cash available for capital expenditures during the year, we determined the proceeds are relevant for the calculation of Free Cash Flow and included them in the table below. Other proceeds from the sale of fixed assets for the periods presented are not significant. We have presented the impact of the sales in the table below, which reconciles Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps, to Net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.Year Ended December 31,2022 Versus 20212021 Versus 2020(in millions)202220212020$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeNet cash provided by operating activities$16,781 $13,917 $8,640 $2,864 21 %$5,277 61 %Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest(13,970)(12,326)(11,034)(1,644)13 %(1,292)12 %Proceeds from sales of tower sites9 40 — (31)(78)%40 NMProceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions4,836 4,131 3,134 705 17 %997 32 %Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs— (116)(82)116 (100)%(34)41 %Free Cash Flow$7,656 $5,646 $658 $2,010 36 %$4,988 758 %Gross cash paid for the settlement of interest rate swaps— — 2,343 — NM(2,343)(100)%Free Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps$7,656 $5,646 $3,001 $2,010 36 %$2,645 88 %NM - Not MeaningfulFree Cash Flow increased $2.0 billion, or 36%.

As of December 31, 2022, there was no outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 8 - Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Revolving Credit Facility. Debt FinancingAs of December 31, 2022, our total debt and financing lease liabilities were $74.5 billion, excluding our tower obligations, of which $66.8 billion was classified as long-term debt and $1.4 billion was classified as long-term financing lease liabilities.During the year ended December 31, 2022, we issued long-term debt for net proceeds of $3.7 billion and repaid short- and long-term debt with an aggregate principal amount of $5.6 billion.Subsequent to December 31, 2022, on February 9, 2023, we issued $1.0 billion of 4.950% Senior Notes due 2028, $1.3 billion of 5.050% Senior Notes due 2033 and $750 million of 5.650% Senior Notes due 2053.For more information regarding our debt financing transactions, see Note 8 – Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Spectrum AuctionsIn March 2021, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder of 142 licenses in Auction 107 (C-band spectrum) for an aggregate purchase price of $9.3 billion, excluding relocation costs. We expect to incur an additional $767 million in fixed relocation costs, which will be paid through 2024.In January 2022, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder of 199 licenses in Auction 110 (3.45 GHz spectrum) for an aggregate purchase price of $2.9 billion. At the inception of Auction 110 in September 2021, we deposited $100 million. We paid the FCC the remaining $2.8 billion for the licenses won in the auction in February 2022.In September 2022, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder of 7,156 licenses in Auction 108 (2.5 GHz spectrum) for an aggregate price of $304 million. At the inception of Auction 108 in June 2022, we deposited $65 million. We paid the FCC the remaining $239 million for the licenses won in the auction in September 2022. Our receipt of these licenses was still awaiting FCC final approval of the auction results as of December 31, 2022.For more information regarding our spectrum licenses, see Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.License Purchase AgreementsOn August 8, 2022, we entered into License Purchase Agreements to acquire spectrum in the 600 MHz band from Channel 51 License Co LLC and LB License Co, LLC in exchange for total cash consideration of $3.5 billion. The closing of this purchase was still awaiting FCC final approval as of December 31, 2022. For more information regarding our License Purchase Agreements, see Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have arrangements, as amended from time to time, to sell certain EIP accounts receivable and service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as a source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2022, we derecognized net receivables of $2.4 billion upon sale through these arrangements. For more information regarding these off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 4 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.45Table of ContentsFuture Sources and Uses of LiquidityWe may seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional debt, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other long-lived assets in private party transactions, repurchase shares, or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. Excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions, other long-lived assets or for any potential stockholder returns, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months as well as our longer-term liquidity needs. Our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of debt, tower obligations, share repurchases and the execution of our integration plan. We determine future liquidity requirements for operations, capital expenditures and share repurchases based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum or repurchase shares. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. We have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses to comply with the Government Commitments, and we are also expected to incur substantial restructuring expenses in connection with integrating and coordinating T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s businesses, operations, policies and procedures. See “Restructuring” in this MD&A. While we have assumed that a certain level of Merger-related expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control, including required consultation and negotiation with certain counterparties, could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. These expenses could exceed the costs historically borne by us and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. There are a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including those due to the impact of the Pandemic, that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment. The indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding financing leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers or borrowers and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to incur more debt, create liens or other encumbrances, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of December 31, 2022.Financing Lease FacilitiesWe have entered into uncommitted financing lease facilities with certain third parties that provide us with the ability to enter into financing leases for network equipment and services. As of December 31, 2022, we have committed to $7.5 billion of financing leases under these financing lease facilities, of which $1.2 billion was executed during the year ended December 31, 2022. We expect to enter into up to an additional $1.2 billion in financing lease commitments during the year ending December 31, 2023. Capital ExpendituresOur liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses, the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure and the integration of the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel and customer base of T-Mobile and Sprint. Property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to the integration of our network and spectrum licenses, including acquired Sprint PCS and 2.5 GHz spectrum licenses, as we build out our nationwide 5G network. We expect a reduction in capital expenditures related to these efforts following 2022. Future capital expenditure requirements will include the deployment of our recently acquired C-band and 3.45 GHz spectrum licenses. For more information regarding our spectrum licenses, see Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Stockholder ReturnsWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.On September 8, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized our 2022 Stock Repurchase Program for up to $14.0 billion of our common stock through September 30, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of $3.0 billion, all of which were purchased under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program and occurred during the period from September 8, 2022, through December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had up to $11.0 billion remaining under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program.46Table of ContentsSubsequent to December 31, 2022, from January 1, 2023, through February 10, 2023, we repurchased additional shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of $2.1 billion. As of February 10, 2023, we had up to $8.9 billion remaining under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program.For additional information regarding the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program, see Note 15 – Repurchases of Common Stock of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Contractual ObligationsIn connection with the regulatory approvals of the Transactions, we made commitments to various state and federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice and FCC. For more information regarding these commitments, see Note 19 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations and borrowings as of December 31, 2022, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods:(in millions)Less Than 1 Year1 - 3 Years3 - 5 YearsMore Than 5 YearsTotalLong-term debt (1)$5,070 $9,142 $10,735 $46,117 $71,064 Interest on long-term debt3,122 5,089 4,134 17,929 30,274 Financing lease liabilities, including imputed interest1,216 1,334 67 11 2,628 Tower obligations (2)424 816 788 4,512 6,540 Operating lease liabilities, including imputed interest4,847 8,419 7,061 21,453 41,780 Purchase obligations (3) (4)4,542 4,876 2,809 2,816 15,043 Spectrum leases and service credits (5)315 587 634 4,615 6,151 Total contractual obligations$19,536 $30,263 $26,228 $97,453 $173,480 (1)Represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premiums, discounts, debt issuance costs, consent fees, and financing lease obligations.

See Note 9 – Tower Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.(3)The minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contracts. Termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due as of the earliest we could exit the contract, typically in less than one year. For certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. This table does not include open purchase orders as of December 31, 2022 under normal business purposes. See Note 19 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (4)On August 8, 2022, we entered into License Purchase Agreements to acquire spectrum in the 600 MHz band from Channel 51 License Co LLC and LB License Co, LLC in exchange for total cash consideration of $3.5 billion. The agreements remain subject to regulatory approval and the purchase price of $3.5 billion is excluded from our reported purchase obligations above.(5)Spectrum lease agreements are typically for five to 10 years with automatic renewal provisions, bringing the total term of the agreements up to 30 years.Certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. Other long-term liabilities have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the lack of historical trends to predict future payments.The purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase spectrum licenses, wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we are contractually committed. Where we are committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether we take delivery, we have included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. The acquisition of spectrum licenses is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.47Table of ContentsRelated Party TransactionsWe have related party transactions associated with DT or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany servicing and licensing.As of February 10, 2023, DT and SoftBank held, directly or indirectly, approximately 49.6% and 3.3%, respectively, of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock, with the remaining approximately 47.1% of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock held by other stockholders. As a result of the Proxy, Lock-Up and ROFR Agreement, dated April 1, 2020, by and between DT and SoftBank and the Proxy, Lock-Up and ROFR Agreement, dated June 22, 2020, by and among DT, Claure Mobile LLC, and Marcelo Claure, DT has voting control, as of February 10, 2023, over approximately 53.3% of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock.Disclosure of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Exchange ActSection 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and the Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act. Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2022, that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with either DT or SoftBank. We have relied upon DT and SoftBank for information regarding their respective activities, transactions and dealings.DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, provided basic telecommunications services to four customers in Germany identified on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List maintained by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control: Bank Melli, Europäisch-Iranische Handelsbank, CPG Engineering & Commercial Services GmbH and Golgohar Trade and Technology GmbH. These services have been terminated or are in the process of being terminated. For the year ended December 31, 2022, gross revenues of all DT affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic and telecommunications services with the Iranian parties identified herein were less than $0.1 million, and the estimated net profits were less than $0.1 million.In addition, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate a fixed-line network in their respective European home countries (in particular Germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the Embassy of Iran in those European countries. Gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities for the year ended, were less than $0.1 million. We understand that DT intends to continue these activities.Separately, SoftBank, through one of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, provides roaming services in Iran through Irancell Telecommunications Services Company. During the year ended December 31, 2022, SoftBank had no gross revenues from such services and no net profit was generated. We understand that the SoftBank subsidiary intends to continue such services. This subsidiary also provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to accounts affiliated with the Embassy of Iran in Japan. During the year ended December 31, 2022, SoftBank estimates that gross revenues and net profit generated by such services were both under $0.1 million. We understand that the SoftBank subsidiary is obligated under contract and intends to continue such services.In addition, SoftBank, through one of its non-U.S. indirect subsidiaries, provides office supplies to the Embassy of Iran in Japan. SoftBank estimates that gross revenue and net profit generated by such services during the year ended December 31, 2022, were both under $0.1 million. We understand that the SoftBank subsidiary intends to continue such activities.48Table of ContentsCritical Accounting EstimatesOur significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition as they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Two of these policies, discussed below, relate to critical estimates because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed and approved the accounting policies associated with these critical estimates.DepreciationOur property and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. We record property and equipment at cost, and we generally depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. If all other factors were to remain unchanged, we expect that a one-year increase in the useful lives of our in-service property and equipment, exclusive of leased devices, would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $3.1 billion in our 2022 depreciation expense and that a one-year decrease in the useful life would have resulted in an increase of approximately $4.0 billion in our 2022 depreciation expense.See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 – Property and Equipment of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management’s underlying estimates of useful lives.Income TaxesDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available.We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the relevant government taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Our interpretations may be subjected to review during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise over the respective tax positions. We attempt to resolve these disputes during the tax examination and audit process and ultimately through the court system when applicable. We monitor relevant tax authorities and revise our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities on a quarterly basis. Revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes also may result from our own income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies. Such revisions in our estimates may be material to our Income tax expense for any given quarter. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedFor information regarding recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.49Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to economic risks in the normal course of business, primarily from changes in interest rates, including changes in investment yields and changes in spreads due to credit risk and other factors. These risks, along with other business risks, impact our cost of capital. Our policy is to manage exposure related to fluctuations in interest rates in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term. We have established interest rate risk limits that are closely monitored by measuring interest rate sensitivities of our debt portfolio. We do not foresee significant changes in the strategies used to manage market risk in the near future.Certain potential sources of financing available to us, including our Revolving Credit Facility, bear interest that is indexed to a benchmark rate plus a fixed margin. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have outstanding balances under these facilities.

1283699,TMUS,"T-Mobile US, Inc.",2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCompany OverviewExcept as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are those of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MetroPCS Wireless, Inc., or Wireless. References to “MetroPCS,”“MetroPCS Communications,” “our Company,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer to MetroPCS Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.We are a wireless telecommunications carrier that currently offers wireless broadband mobile services primarily in selected major metropolitan areas in the United States, including the Atlanta, Boston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Orlando/Jacksonville, Philadelphia, Sacramento, San Francisco and Tampa/Sarasota metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2011, we hold licenses for wireless spectrum suitable for wireless broadband mobile services covering a total population of 142 million people in and around many of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States. In addition, we have roaming agreements with other wireless broadband mobile carriers that allow us to offer our customers service in many areas when they are outside our service area. These roaming agreements, together with the area we serve with our own networks, allows our customers to receive service in an area covering over 280 million in total population under the Metro USA® brand. We provide our services using code division multiple access, or CDMA, networks using 1xRTT technology and evolved data only, or EVDO, and, fourth generation, or 4G, long term evolution, or 4G LTE, technology. We introduced the first commercial 4G LTE service in the United States in our Las Vegas and Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan areas in September 2010 and at that time launched the world's first dual mode 4G LTE/CDMA handset. Subsequently through the remainder of 2010 and early 2011, we launched our 4G LTE service in the remainder of our major metropolitan areas. In 2005, Royal Street Communications, LLC, or Royal Street Communications, and with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, or collectively, Royal Street, was granted licenses by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, in Los Angeles and various metropolitan areas throughout northern Florida. From 2005 through 2010, Royal Street constructed networks with our assistance in its licensed service areas and sold us services on its network on a wholesale basis which we in turn marketed on a retail basis under the MetroPCS® brand to our customers. In December 2010, we consummated the purchase of the remaining 15% interest in Royal Street Communications with the consent of the FCC, resulting in Royal Street Communications and its wholly-owned subsidiaries becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company.As a result of the significant growth we have experienced since we launched operations, our results of operations to date are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected in future periods. We expect that our number of customers will continue to increase, which will continue to contribute to increases in our revenues and operating expenses.We sell products and services to customers through our Company-owned retail stores as well as indirectly through relationships with independent retailers. Our service allows our customers to place unlimited local calls from within our local service area and to receive unlimited calls from any area while in our service area, for a flat-rate monthly service fee. In January 2010, we introduced a new family of service plans, which include all applicable taxes and regulatory fees and offering nationwide voice, text and web access services on an unlimited, no long-term contract, paid-in-advance, flat-rate basis beginning at $40 per month. For an additional $5 to $20 per month, our customers may select alternative service plans that offer additional features on an unlimited basis. We also offer discounts to customers who purchase services for additional handsets on the same account. In January 2011, we introduced new 4G LTE service plans that allow customers to enjoy voice, text and web access services at fixed monthly rates starting as low as $40 per month. For additional usage fees, we also provide certain other value-added services. All of these plans require payment in advance for one month of service. If no payment is made in advance for the following month of service, service is suspended at the end of the month that was paid for by the customer and, if the customer does not pay within 30 days, the customer is terminated. Our service plans differentiate us from the more complex plans and long-term contract requirements of traditional wireless carriers.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. You should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different 63Table of Contentsassumptions or conditions.We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionOur wireless services are provided on a month-to-month basis and are paid in advance. We recognize revenues from wireless services as they are rendered. Amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Suspending service for non-payment is known as hotlining. We do not recognize revenue on hotlined customers.Revenues and related costs from the sale of accessories are recognized at the point of sale. The cost of handsets sold to indirect retailers are included in deferred charges until they are sold to and activated by customers. Amounts billed to indirect retailers for handsets are recorded as accounts receivable and deferred revenue upon shipment by us and are recognized as equipment revenues and related costs when service is activated by customers.Our customers have the right to return handsets within a specified time or within a certain amount of use, whichever occurs first. We record an estimate for returns as contra-revenue at the time of recognizing revenue. Our assessment of estimated returns is based on historical return rates. If our customers' actual returns are not consistent with our estimates of their returns, revenues may be different than initially recorded. Our reserves for returns were not significant as of December 31, 2010 or 2011.We have revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and follow the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13 ""Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements,"" or ASU 2009-13. ASU 2009-13 which amended the methodology upon which companies allocated revenue within arrangements with multiple deliverables under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, (Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition”), allowing for allocation based upon a selling price hierarchy that permits the use of an estimated selling price to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration to a deliverable in a multiple-deliverable arrangement where neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available for that deliverable, eliminating the residual method.We have determined that the sale of wireless services through our direct and indirect sales channels with an accompanying handset constitutes a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables. We divide these arrangements into separate units of accounting, and allocate the consideration between the handset and the wireless service. Under the amended provisions of ASU 2009-13, the amount allocable to the delivered unit or units of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specific performance conditions, or the non-contingent amount. We have considered our customer service policies and historical practices and concluded that the amount of consideration received related to service revenue is contingent upon delivery of the wireless service as the customer may receive a service credit if we did not deliver the service. Any remaining consideration received is recognized as equipment revenue when the handset is delivered and accepted by the customer as it represents the non-contingent amount. Delivery of the wireless service generally occurs over the one month period following delivery and acceptance of the equipment by the customer as we do not require our customers to enter into long-term contracts. The value allocable to the undelivered wireless service element is based on the monthly service amounts charged to customers in the months following their initial month of service. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts ReceivableWe maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our independent retailers to pay for equipment purchases, for amounts estimated to be uncollectible from other carriers for intercarrier compensation and for amounts estimated to be uncollectible from customers with mid-cycle plan changes where service has been provided prior to the receipt of payment based on billing terms. We estimate allowances for uncollectible accounts from independent retailers based on the length of time the receivables are past due, the current business environment and our historical experience. If the financial condition of a material portion of our independent retailers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific carrier's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record a specific allowance for intercarrier compensation against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. Total allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable as of December 31, 2011 was approximately 1% of the total amount of gross accounts receivable.64Table of ContentsInventoriesWe write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value or replacement cost based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Write-downs for obsolescent and unmarketable inventory were not significant as of December 31, 2010 and 2011. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required.Deferred Income Tax Asset and Other Tax ReservesWe assess our deferred tax asset and record a valuation allowance, when necessary, to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future taxable income, taxable temporary differences and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period we made that determination.We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax returns are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and ultimately modified. We adjust the reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of income tax related reserve positions and changes to income tax reserves that we consider appropriate. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is finally resolved. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash or a reduction in our net operating loss carryforwards. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the effective rate in the year of resolution. Tax reserves as of December 31, 2011 were approximately $13.7 million of which $6.0 million and approximately $7.7 million are presented on the consolidated balance sheet in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively.Property and EquipmentDepreciation on property and equipment is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service, which are five to ten years for network infrastructure assets, three to ten years for capitalized interest, up to fifteen years for capital lease assets, approximately one to eight years for office equipment, which includes software and computer equipment, approximately three to seven years for furniture and fixtures and five years for vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease and any renewal periods reasonably assured or the estimated useful life of the improvement. The estimated life of property and equipment is based on historical experience with similar assets, as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. If technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation expense in future periods. Likewise, if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than anticipated, the life of the assets could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to property and equipment. This could result in a reduction of depreciation expense in future periods.We assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or in the strategy for our overall business. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations. There have been no indicators that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable and accordingly no impairment tests have been performed. The carrying value of property and equipment was $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2011.Fair Value MeasurementsWe follow the provisions of ASC 820 (Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”). ASC 820 establishes a three-tiered fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. ASC 820 requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation.65Table of ContentsIntangible AssetsWe operate wireless broadband mobile networks under licenses granted by the FCC for a particular geographic area on spectrum allocated by the FCC for terrestrial wireless broadband services. We hold personal communications services, or PCS, licenses, advanced wireless services, or AWS, licenses, and 700 MHz licenses granted or acquired on various dates. The PCS licenses previously included, and the AWS licenses currently include, the obligation and resulting costs to relocate existing fixed microwave users of our licensed spectrum if the use of its spectrum interferes with their systems and/or reimburse other carriers (according to FCC rules) that relocated prior users if the relocation benefits our system. Accordingly, we incurred costs related to microwave relocation in constructing our PCS and AWS networks. FCC Licenses and related microwave relocation costs are recorded at cost. Although FCC licenses are issued with a stated term, ten years in the case of PCS licenses, fifteen years in the case of AWS licenses and approximately ten years for 700 MHz licenses, the renewal of PCS, AWS and 700 MHz licenses is generally a routine matter without substantial cost and we have determined that no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors exist as of December 31, 2011 that limit the useful life of our PCS, AWS and 700 MHz licenses. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are our PCS, AWS and 700 MHz licenses and microwave relocation costs. Based on the requirements of ASC 350 (Topic 350, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other”), we test investments in our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. We perform our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test as of each September 30th. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value with the carrying value. An impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related indefinite-lived intangible assets and charged to results of operations.We used an income approach, the Greenfield Methodology, to provide an indication of fair value for our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Such methodology is based on the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up operation and assumes that the only assets upon formation are the underlying FCC licenses, and that the business enterprise does not have any other assets including goodwill or going concern value at the date of inception. The start-up assumptions include utilization of the asset in its highest and best use and incorporate market participant assumptions for key factors, such as current and future technology, costs of telecommunications equipment, and workforce costs, considering the opportunities and constraints of the underlying spectrum as of the valuation date. Cash flow projections involve assumptions that include a degree of uncertainty, include future cash flows, long-term growth rates, appropriate discount rates and other inputs. We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use to estimate fair value. For the purpose of performing the annual impairment test as of September 30, 2011, our indefinite-lived intangible assets were aggregated and combined into a single unit of accounting, consistent with the management of the business on a national scope. No impairment was recognized as the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was in excess of their carrying value as of September 30, 2011. Historically, we have not experienced significant negative variations between our assumptions and estimates when compared to actual results. However, if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge associated with indefinite-lived intangible assets. Although we do not expect our estimates or assumptions to change significantly in the future, the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets or using a methodology other than a discounted cash flow model could result in different values for our indefinite-lived intangible assets and may affect any related impairment charge. The most significant assumptions within our discounted cash flow model are the discount rate, our projected growth rate and projected cash flows. A one percent decline in annual revenue growth rates, a one percent decline in annual net cash flows or a one percent increase in discount rate would not result in impairment as of September 30, 2011.Indefinite-lived intangible assets must be tested between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in an entity's market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors. We reviewed changes in the business climate, changes in market capitalization, legal factors, operating performance indicators and competition, among other factors and their potential impact on our fair value determination. There have been no significant changes in any of these factors that have adversely affected any of the key assumptions used in our determination of fair value. Furthermore, if any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets are subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, we would test such assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360 (Topic 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment”), and the intangible assets would then be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life.66Table of ContentsFor the license impairment test performed as of September 30, 2011, the aggregate fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets was in excess of the aggregate carrying values. There also have been no subsequent indicators of impairment, including those indicated in ASC 360, and accordingly no subsequent interim impairment tests were performed.Share-Based PaymentsWe account for share-based awards exchanged for employee services in accordance with ASC 718 (Topic 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation”). Under ASC 718, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period.We have granted restricted stock awards that entitle the holder to receive shares of common stock which become fully tradable upon vesting. The restricted stock awards granted generally vest on a four-year vesting schedule with 25% vesting on the first anniversary date of the award and the remainder pro-rata on a monthly or quarterly basis thereafter, subject to a service condition that relates only to vesting. The estimated compensation expense, which is equal to the fair value of the awards on the date of grant, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.We have also granted nonqualified stock options. Most of our stock option awards include a service condition that relates only to vesting. The stock option awards generally vest in three to four years from the grant date with 25% vesting on the first anniversary date of the award. Compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award.The determination of the fair value of stock options using an option-pricing model is affected by our common stock valuation as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. The Board of Directors uses the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant as the fair market value for our common stock. The volatility assumption is based on a combination of the historical volatility of our common stock and the volatilities of similar companies over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock options. The volatilities of similar companies are used in conjunction with our historical volatility because of the lack of sufficient relevant history equal to the expected term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. The expected term assumption is estimated based primarily on the stock options' vesting terms and remaining contractual life and employees' expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on the grant date appropriate for the term of the employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the expectation of no future dividend payouts by us.The value of the options is determined by using a Black-Scholes pricing model that includes the following variables: 1) exercise price of the instrument, 2) fair market value of the underlying stock on date of grant, 3) expected life, 4) estimated volatility and 5) the risk-free interest rate. We utilized the following weighted-average assumptions in estimating the fair value of the options grants for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010Expected dividends —% —%Expected volatility 49.88% 54.74%Risk-free interest rate 2.06% 2.24%Expected lives in years 5.00 5.00Weighted-average fair value of options: Granted at fair value $6.49 $3.23Weighted-average exercise price of options: Granted at fair value $14.37 $6.62The Black-Scholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions including expectations of future dividends and stock price volatility. Such assumptions are only used for making the required fair value estimate and should not be considered as indicators of future dividend policy or stock price appreciation. Because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, and because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, the use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model may not provide a reliable estimate of the fair value of employee stock options.67Table of ContentsCompensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award.As share-based compensation expense under ASC 718 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it is reduced for estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We recognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $41.8 million, $46.5 million and $47.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Customer Recognition and Disconnect PoliciesUntil January 2010, when a new customer subscribed to our service, the first month of service was included with the handset purchase. Beginning in January 2010, the first month of service is no longer included in the handset purchase. Under GAAP, we are required to allocate the purchase price to the handset and to the wireless service revenue. Generally, the amount allocated to the handset will be less than our cost, and this difference is included in cost per gross addition, or CPGA. We recognize new customers as gross customer additions upon activation of service. Prior to January 2010, we offered our customers the Metro Promise, which allowed a customer to return a newly purchased handset for a full refund prior to the earlier of 30 days or 60 minutes of use. Beginning in January 2010, we revised our Metro Promise policy to allow a customer to return a newly purchased handset for a full refund within 7 days of purchase and less than 60 minutes of use. Customers who returned their phones under the Metro Promise are reflected as a reduction to gross customer additions. Customers' monthly service payments are due in advance every month. Our customers must pay their monthly service amount by the payment date or their service will be suspended, or hotlined, and the customer will not be able to make or receive calls on our network. However, a hotlined customer is still able to make E-911 calls in the event of an emergency. There is no service grace period. Any call attempted by a hotlined customer is routed directly to our interactive voice response system and customer service center in order to arrange payment. If the customer pays the amount due within 30 days of the original payment date then the customer's service is restored. If a hotlined customer does not pay the amount due within 30 days of the payment date the account is disconnected and counted as churn. Once an account is disconnected we may charge a reconnect fee upon reactivation to reestablish service and the revenue associated with this fee is deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the customer. RevenuesWe derive our revenues from the following sources:Service. We sell wireless broadband mobile services. The various types of service revenues associated with wireless broadband mobile for our customers include monthly recurring charges for airtime, one-time or monthly recurring charges for optional features (including nationwide long distance, unlimited international long distance, unlimited text messaging, international text messaging, voicemail, downloads, ringtones, games and content applications, unlimited directory assistance, enhanced directory assistance, ring back tones, mobile Internet browsing, location based services, mobile instant messaging, navigation, video streaming, video on demand, push e-mail and nationwide roaming) and charges for long distance service. Service revenues also include intercarrier compensation and nonrecurring reactivation service charges to customers. Equipment. We sell wireless broadband mobile handsets and accessories that are used by our customers in connection with our wireless broadband mobile services. This equipment is also sold to our independent retailers to facilitate distribution to our customers.Costs and ExpensesOur costs and expenses include:Cost of Service. The major components of our cost of service are: •Cell Site Costs. We incur expenses for the rent of cell sites, network facilities, engineering operations, field technicians and related utility and maintenance charges.•Interconnection Costs. We pay other telecommunications companies and third-party providers for leased facilities and usage-based charges for transporting and terminating network traffic from our cell sites and switching centers. We have pre-negotiated rates for transport and termination of calls originated by our customers, including negotiated interconnection agreements with relevant exchange carriers in each of our service areas.68Table of Contents•Variable Long Distance. We pay charges to other telecommunications companies for long distance service provided to our customers. These variable charges are based on our customers’ usage, applied at pre-negotiated rates with the long distance carriers.•Customer Support. We pay charges to nationally recognized third-party providers for customer care, billing and payment processing services.Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment primarily includes the cost of handsets and accessories purchased from third-party vendors to resell to our customers and independent retailers in connection with our services. We do not manufacture any of this equipment.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling expenses include advertising and promotional costs associated with marketing and selling to new customers and fixed charges such as retail store rent and retail associates’ salaries. General and administrative expenses include support functions including technical operations, finance, accounting, human resources, information technology and legal services. We record stock-based compensation expense in cost of service and in selling, general and administrative expenses for expense associated with employee stock options and restricted stock awards, which is measured at the date of grant, based on the estimated fair value of the award.Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service, which are six to ten years for network infrastructure assets, three to ten years for capitalized interest, up to fifteen years for capital leases, approximately one to eight years for office equipment, which includes software and computer equipment, approximately three to seven years for furniture and fixtures and five years for vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the respective leases, which includes renewal periods that are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the improvement.Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense includes interest incurred on our borrowings and capital lease obligations, amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of discounts and premiums on long-term debt. Interest income is earned primarily on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.Income Taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 we paid no federal income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 we paid $4.5 million, approximately $2.9 million and $3.1 million, respectively, of state income tax. SeasonalityOur customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. Based on historical results, we generally expect the net customer additions to be strongest in the first and fourth quarters. Softening of sales and increased customer turnover, or churn, in the second and third calendar quarters of the year usually combine to result in fewer net customer additions. However, sales activity and churn can be strongly affected by the launch of new metropolitan areas, introduction of new price plans, and by promotional activity, which could reduce or outweigh certain seasonal effects.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, cost of service includes $3.5 million and selling, general and administrative expenses includes $43.0 million of stock-based compensation expense.Service Revenues. Service revenues increased $738.5 million, or 20%, to approximately $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 from approximately $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in service revenues is primarily attributable to net customer additions of approximately 1.2 million customers for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 as well as a $0.78 increase in average revenue per customer compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.Equipment Revenues. Equipment revenues increased $39.5 million, or 10%, to $419.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $379.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in upgrade handset sales to existing customers as well as an increase in gross customer additions which led to a $90.2 million increase. This increase was partially offset by a lower average price of handsets sold accounting for $50.5 million. Cost of Service. Cost of service increased $249.9 million, or 20%, to approximately $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 from approximately $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in cost of service is primarily attributable to a 15% growth in our customer base and the deployment of additional network infrastructure, including network infrastructure for 4G LTE, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 as well as additional roaming expenses associated with Metro USA.Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment increased $345.7 million, or 32%, to approximately $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 from approximately $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in handset upgrades by existing customers and an increase in gross customer additions which led to a $192.0 million increase, as well as a higher average cost of handsets accounting for a $151.6 million increase. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $22.3 million, or 4%, to $644.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $621.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Selling expenses increased by $11.4 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in selling expenses is primarily attributable to a $6.9 million increase in employee related costs and a $5.2 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $15.5 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to the growth in our business.70Table of ContentsDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $89.1 million, or 20%, to $538.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $449.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase related primarily to network infrastructure assets placed into service during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 to support the continued growth and expansion of our network.Loss (gain) on Disposal of Assets. Loss on disposal of assets was $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to a gain on disposal of assets of $38.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The loss on disposal of assets during the year ended December 31, 2011 was due primarily to the disposal of assets related to certain network technology that were retired and replaced with newer technology. The gain on disposal of assets during the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to spectrum exchange agreements that were consummated during the period. Non-Operating Items Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Change (in thousands) Interest expense $261,073 $263,125 (1%)Loss on extinguishment of debt 9,536 143,626 (93%)Provision for income taxes 178,346 118,879 50%Net income 301,310 193,415 56%Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $2.0 million, or 1%, to $261.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $263.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a $36.7 million decrease in interest expense on our senior notes as a result of the redemption of our 9¼% senior notes due 2014, or 9¼% Senior Notes, in late 2010 and the issuance of new senior notes at a lower rate of interest. This decrease was partially offset by a $37.8 million increase in interest expense on the senior secured credit facility, as amended, as a result of the issuance of a new tranche of term loans in the amount of $500.0 million, or Tranche B-3 Term Loans, in March 2011 as well as the issuance of an additional $1.0 billion of Tranche B-3 Term Loans, or the Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans, in May 2011. This increase in interest expense was partially offset by lower interest expense due to the repayment of $535.8 million of existing tranche B-1 term loans, or Tranche B-1 Term Loans, in May 2011. Our weighted average interest rate decreased to 6.09% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 compared to 7.29% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. Average debt outstanding for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was approximately $4.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 was due to the repayment of $535.8 million in outstanding principal under the Tranche B-1 Term Loans in May 2011. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $143.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was due to the redemption of $1.95 billion of outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 9¼% Senior Notes during the year ended December 31, 2010.Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense was $178.3 million and $118.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The effective tax rate was 37.2% and 38.1% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal rate of 35.0% primarily due to net state and local taxes, tax credits and state legislative changes. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal rate of 35.0% due to net state and local taxes, tax credits and non-deductible expenses. Provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 include a benefit of $4.8 million and $6.9 million, respectively, related to income tax credits. Net Income. Net income increased $107.9 million, or 56%, to $301.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $193.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to a 93% decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt and an increase in income from operations, partially offset by a 50% increase in provision for income taxes.71Table of ContentsYear Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009Operating ItemsSet forth below is a summary of certain financial information for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Change (in thousands) REVENUES: Service revenues $3,689,695 $3,130,385 18%Equipment revenues 379,658 350,130 8%Total revenues 4,069,353 3,480,515 17%OPERATING EXPENSES: Cost of service (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below)(1) 1,223,931 1,120,052 9%Cost of equipment 1,093,944 884,272 24%Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization disclosed separately below)(1) 621,660 567,730 9%Depreciation and amortization 449,732 377,856 19%Gain on disposal of assets (38,812) (4,683) **Total operating expenses 3,350,455 2,945,227 14%Income from operations $718,898 $535,288 34% _____________________________** Not meaningful.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, cost of service includes $4.2 million and selling, general and administrative expenses includes $43.6 million of stock-based compensation expense.Service Revenues. Service revenues increased $559.3 million, or 18%, to approximately $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 from approximately $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in service revenues is primarily attributable to net customer additions of 1.5 million customers for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. Equipment Revenues. Equipment revenues increased $29.5 million, or 8%, to $379.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $350.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in upgrade handset sales to existing customers accounting for $85.9 million. This increase was partially offset by lower average price of handsets activated reducing equipment revenues by $17.7 million coupled with $42.2 million that would have been recognized as service revenues but was classified as equipment revenues during the year ended December 31, 2009, in accordance with ASC 605, because the consideration received from customers was less than the fair value of promotionally priced handsets. Cost of Service. Cost of service increased $103.9 million, or 9%, to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in cost of service is primarily attributable to the 23% growth in our customer base and the deployment of additional network infrastructure, including network infrastructure for 4G LTE, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and costs associated with our unlimited international calling product. Cost of Equipment. Cost of equipment increased $209.7 million, or 24%, to approximately $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $884.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to higher upgrade handset costs to existing customers which led to a $248.2 million increase, partially offset by a decrease in gross customer additions accounting for a $37.3 million decrease. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $54.0 million, or 9%, to $621.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $567.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Selling expenses increased by $28.3 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in selling expenses is primarily attributable to a $37.0 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses as well as a $4.4 million increase in employee related costs to support our growth. These increases were 72Table of Contentspartially offset by a $13.1 million decrease in MetroFLASH® expense. General and administrative expenses increased $26.2 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the growth in our business.Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $71.9 million, or 19%, to $449.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $377.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase related primarily to an increase in network infrastructure assets placed into service during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 to support the continued growth and expansion of our network.Gain on Disposal of Assets. Gain on disposal of assets increased $34.1 million to $38.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in the gain on disposal of assets was primarily due to spectrum exchange agreements consummated during the year ended December 31, 2010, partially offset by a loss on disposal of assets related to certain network technology that was retired and replaced with newer technology during the year ended December 31, 2010.Non-Operating Items Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Change (in thousands) Interest expense $263,125 $270,285 (3%)Loss on extinguishment of debt 143,626 — 100%Provision for income taxes 118,879 86,835 37%Net income 193,415 176,844 9%Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $7.2 million, or 3%, to $263.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $270.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a $28.1 million reduction in interest expense on the senior secured credit facility as a result of a lower weighted average annual interest rate due to the interest rate protection agreements that were effective on February 1, 2010, partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest of $13.0 million. Our weighted average interest rate decreased to 7.29% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 compared to 8.23% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Average debt outstanding for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $3.6 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively.Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $143.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was due to the redemption of $1.95 billion of outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 9¼% Senior Notes due 2014 during the year ended December 31, 2010.Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense was $118.9 million and $86.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective tax rate was 38.1% and 32.9% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, our effective rate differs from the statutory federal rate of 35.0% due to net state and local taxes, tax credits, non-deductible expenses, valuation allowance on impairment on investment securities and a net change in uncertain tax positions. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010 includes a benefit of $6.9 million related to income tax credits. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes a net decrease in a state unrecognized tax benefit of $18.1 million due to the expiration of a statute of limitations. Net Income. Net income increased $16.6 million, or 9%, to $193.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $176.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to a 34% increase in income from operations combined with a 3% decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a 37% increase in provision for income taxes and a loss on extinguishment of debt.Performance MeasuresIn managing our business and assessing our financial performance, we supplement the information provided by financial statement measures with several customer-focused performance metrics that are widely used in the wireless industry. These metrics include average revenue per user per month, or ARPU, which measures service revenue per customer; cost per gross customer addition, or CPGA, which measures the average cost of acquiring a new customer; cost per user per month, or CPU, which measures the non-selling cash cost of operating our business on a per customer basis; churn, which measures turnover in our customer base; and Adjusted EBITDA, which measures the financial performance of our operations. For a reconciliation of 73Table of Contentsnon-GAAP performance measures and a further discussion of the measures, please read “— Reconciliation of non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.The following table shows metric information for the year ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009Customers: End of period 9,346,659 8,155,110 6,639,524Net additions 1,191,549 1,515,586 1,272,691Churn: Average monthly rate 3.8% 3.6% 5.5%ARPU $40.57 $39.79 $40.68CPGA $173.11 $157.26 $145.79CPU $19.56 $18.49 $17.23Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands) $1,331,783 $1,176,355 $956,244Customers. Net customer additions were 1,191,549 for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 1,515,586 for the year ended December 31, 2010. Total customers were 9,346,659 as of December 31, 2011, an increase of 15% over the customer total as of December 31, 2010. The increase in total customers is primarily attributable to the continued demand for our service offerings. Net customer additions were 1,515,586 for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to 1,272,691 for the year ended December 31, 2009. Total customers were 8,155,110 as of December 31, 2010, an increase of 23% over the customer total as of December 31, 2009. The increase in total customers is primarily attributable to the continued demand for our service offerings. Churn. As we do not require a long-term service contract, our churn percentage is expected to be higher than traditional wireless carriers that require customers to sign a one- to two-year contract with significant early termination fees. Average monthly churn represents (a) the number of customers who have been disconnected from our system during the measurement period less the number of customers who have reactivated service, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. We classify delinquent customers as churn after they have been delinquent for 30 days. In addition, when an existing customer establishes a new account in connection with the purchase of an upgraded or replacement phone and does not identify themselves as an existing customer, we count the phone leaving service as a churn and the new phone entering service as a gross customer addition (“false churn”). Churn for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 3.8%, compared to 3.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in churn was primarily driven by an increase in gross additions, adjusted for false churn, in the first nine months of 2011 over the first nine months of 2010, and we believe continued economic pressures on our subscribers as well as increased data demands on our CDMA network driven by Android penetration. Churn for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 3.6%, compared to 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in churn was primarily related to the acceptance of our Wireless for All tax and regulatory fee inclusive service plans including a decline in false churn as we no longer offer the first month of service for free. Our customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. Based on historical results, we generally expect net customer additions to be strongest in the first and fourth quarters. Softening of sales and increased churn in the second and third quarters of the year usually combine to result in fewer net customer additions during these quarters. See – “Seasonality.”Average Revenue Per User. ARPU represents (a) service revenues plus impact to service revenues of promotional activity less pass through charges for the measurement period, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. ARPU was $40.57 and $39.79 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, an increase of $0.78. The $0.78 increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to the continued demand for our Wireless for All and 4G LTE service plans offset by an increase in family plan penetration from 32% of our customer base in 2010 to 45% of our customer base in 2011. ARPU was $40.68 for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $0.89 decrease in ARPU for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily attributable to the new Wireless for All service plans that were introduced in January 2010, which include all applicable taxes and regulatory fees. This decrease was partially offset by our unlimited international calling plan that launched in June 2009.Cost Per Gross Addition. CPGA is determined by dividing (a) selling expenses plus the total cost of equipment associated with transactions with new customers less equipment revenues associated with transactions with new customers during the measurement period adjusted for impact to service revenues of promotional activity by (b) gross customer additions during such period. Retail customer service expenses and equipment margin on handsets sold to existing customers when they are 74Table of Contentsidentified, including handset upgrade transactions, are excluded, as these costs are incurred specifically for existing customers. CPGA costs increased to $173.11 for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $157.26 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in CPGA for the year ended December 31, 2011, when compared to the same period in 2010, was primarily driven by increased promotional activities. CPGA costs increased to $157.26 for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $145.79 for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase in CPGA was primarily driven by various promotional activities as well as lower gross additions. Cost Per User. CPU is determined by dividing (a) cost of service and general and administrative costs (excluding applicable stock-based compensation expense included in cost of service and general and administrative expense) plus net loss on handset equipment transactions unrelated to initial customer acquisition, divided by (b) the sum of the average monthly number of customers during such period. CPU for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $19.56 and $18.49, respectively. The $1.07 increase in CPU for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily driven by the increase in retention expense related to existing customers, costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and roaming expenses associated with Metro USA, offset by the continued scaling of our business. CPU for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $17.23. The $1.26 increase in CPU for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily driven by the increase in handset subsidies for upgrades by existing customers, the inclusion of regulatory fees in our Wireless for All service plans as well as costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade. Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus depreciation and amortization; gain (loss) on disposal of assets; stock-based compensation expense; gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt; provision for income taxes; interest expense; minus interest and other income and non-cash items increasing consolidated net income. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased to approximately $1.3 billion from approximately $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $956.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.The following table shows consolidated quarterly metric information for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011.

A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented.ARPU, CPGA, CPU and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to judge our ability to meet our liquidity requirements and to evaluate our operating performance. We believe these measures are important in understanding the performance of our operations from period to period, and although every company in the wireless industry does not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures (which are common in the wireless industry) facilitate key liquidity and operating performance comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry. The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures with our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP.ARPU — We utilize ARPU to evaluate our per-customer service revenue realization and to assist in forecasting our future service revenues. ARPU is calculated exclusive of pass through charges that we collect from our customers and remit to the appropriate government agencies.75Table of ContentsAverage number of customers for any measurement period is determined by dividing (a) the sum of the average monthly number of customers for the measurement period by (b) the number of months in such period. Average monthly number of customers for any month represents the sum of the number of customers on the first day of the month and the last day of the month divided by two. ARPU for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 includes approximately $0.8 million and $42.9 million, respectively, that would have been recognized as service revenues but were classified as equipment revenues because the consideration received from customers was less than the fair value of promotionally priced handsets. The following tables reconcile total revenues used in the calculation of ARPU to service revenues, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to ARPU.

This measure also allows us to compare our average acquisition costs per new customer to those of other wireless broadband mobile providers, although other providers may calculate this measure differently. Equipment revenues related to new customers, adjusted for the impact to service revenues of promotional activity, are deducted from selling expenses in this calculation as they represent amounts paid by customers at the time their service is activated that reduce our acquisition cost of those customers. Additionally, equipment costs associated with existing customers, net of related revenues, are excluded as this measure is intended to reflect only the acquisition costs related to new customers. The following tables reconcile total costs used in the calculation of CPGA to selling expenses, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to CPGA.76Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in thousands, except gross customer additions and CPGA)Calculation of Cost Per Gross Addition (CPGA): Selling expenses $342,019 $330,593 $302,275Less: Equipment revenues (419,174) (379,658) (350,130)Add: Impact to service revenues of promotional activity — 778 42,931Add: Equipment revenue not associated with new customers 261,271 225,115 169,929Add: Cost of equipment 1,439,595 1,093,944 884,272Less: Equipment costs not associated with new customers (704,257) (520,972) (275,793)Gross addition expenses $919,454 $749,800 $773,484Divided by: Gross customer additions 5,311,276 4,768,011 5,305,505CPGA $173.11 $157.26 $145.79 Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 June 30, 2010 September 30, 2010 December 31, 2010 (in thousands, except gross customer additions and CPGA)Calculation of Cost Per Gross Addition (CPGA): Selling expenses $89,146 $86,194 $73,380 $81,872Less: Equipment revenues (117,220) (90,399) (78,538) (93,502)Add: Impact to service revenues of promotional activity 778 — — —Add: Equipment revenue not associated with new customers 63,313 54,392 54,201 53,210Add: Cost of equipment 313,738 235,354 256,265 288,587Less: Equipment costs not associated with new customers (134,744) (113,377) (128,016) (144,834)Gross addition expenses $215,011 $172,164 $177,292 $185,333Divided by: Gross customer additions 1,470,865 1,047,898 1,104,350 1,144,898CPGA $146.18 $164.29 $160.54 $161.88 Three Months Ended March 31, 2011 June 30, 2011 September 30, 2011 December 31, 2011 (in thousands, except gross customer additions and CPGA)Calculation of Cost Per Gross Addition (CPGA): Selling expenses $91,863 $78,522 $88,702 $82,933Less: Equipment revenues (144,160) (96,161) (74,334) (104,519)Add: Equipment revenue not associated with new customers 75,234 59,355 58,026 68,655Add: Cost of equipment 409,262 342,534 343,473 344,326Less: Equipment costs not associated with new customers (192,202) (159,931) (163,610) (188,514)Gross addition expenses $239,997 $224,319 $252,257 $202,881Divided by: Gross customer additions 1,525,880 1,261,091 1,300,611 1,223,694CPGA $157.28 $177.88 $193.95 $165.79CPU — We utilize CPU as a tool to evaluate the non-selling cash expenses associated with ongoing business operations on a per customer basis, to track changes in these non-selling cash costs over time, and to help evaluate how changes in our business operations affect non-selling cash costs per customer.

This measurement, together with GAAP measures such as revenue and income from operations, assists management in its decision-making process related to the operation of our business. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income, or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other wireless carriers may calculate this measure differently.We believe that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate our overall operating performance and that this metric facilitates comparisons with other wireless communications companies. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a metric to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure, from period-to-period, our ability to provide cash flows to meet future debt services, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and fund future growth. The following tables illustrate the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to net income and cash flows from operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to Adjusted EBITDA.

are our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and cash generated from operations. At December 31, 2011, we had a total of approximately $2.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, an increase of $1.1 billion since December 31, 2010. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term 81Table of Contentsinvestments is due to various financing activities as detailed below. We believe that, based on our current level of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and our anticipated cash flows from operations, we have adequate liquidity, cash flow and financial flexibility to fund our operations for the near-term.In July 2010, Wireless entered into an Amendment and Restatement and Resignation and Appointment Agreement, or the Amendment, which amended and restated the senior secured credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity of $1.0 billion of existing term loans, or Tranche B-2 Term Loans, under the senior secured credit facility to November 2016 as well as increase the interest rate to LIBOR plus 3.50% on the extended portion only and reduce the revolving credit facility from $100.0 million to $67.5 million. In September 2010, Wireless completed the sale of $1.0 billion of principal amount of 7 7/8% Senior Notes due 2018, or the 7 7/8% Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the sale of the 7 7/8% Senior Notes were $974.0 million. Net proceeds from the sale of the 7 7/8% Senior Notes were used to redeem a portion of the outstanding 9 1/4% Senior Notes.In November 2010, Wireless completed the sale of $1.0 billion of principal amount of 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2020, or the 6 5/8% Senior Notes. The net proceeds of the sale of the 6 5/8% Senior Notes were $988.1 million.In November 2010, Wireless completed the redemption of the remaining outstanding 9 1/4% Senior Notes.In March 2011, Wireless entered into an Amendment and Restatement, or the New Amendment, which further amended and restated the senior secured credit facility to, among other things, provide for the Tranche B-3 Term Loans, which will mature in March 2018 and have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75%. The New Amendment also increases the interest rate on the existing Tranche B-2 Term Loans under the senior secured credit facility, as amended, to LIBOR plus 3.821%. In addition, the aggregate amount of the revolving credit facility was increased from $67.5 million to $100.0 million and the maturity of the revolving credit facility was extended to March 2016. The New Amendment modified certain limitations under the senior secured credit facility, as amended, including limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, make certain restricted payments, sell assets, make certain investments or acquisitions, grant liens and pay dividends. In addition, Wireless is no longer subject to certain financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum senior secured consolidated leverage ratio. However, under certain circumstances, we could be subject to certain financial covenants that contain ratios based on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as defined by the senior secured credit facility, as amended. Under the New Amendment, the definition of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA has changed and no longer excludes interest and other income.In May 2011, Wireless entered into an Incremental Commitment Agreement, or the Incremental Agreement, which supplements the New Amendment to provide for the Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans which amount was borrowed on May 10, 2011. The Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% and will mature in March 2018. The Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans are repayable in quarterly installments of $2.5 million. A portion of the proceeds from the Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans were used to prepay the $535.8 million in outstanding principal under the Tranche B-1 Term Loans, with the remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes, including opportunistic spectrum acquisitions. The net proceeds from the Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans were $455.5 million after prepayment of the Tranche B-1 Term Loans, underwriter fees, other debt issuance costs of approximately $7.9 million. The Incremental Agreement did not modify the interest rate, maturity date or any of the other terms of the New Amendment applicable to the Tranche B-2 Term Loans or the existing Tranche B-3 Term Loans. Our strategy has been to offer our services in major metropolitan areas and their surrounding areas, which we refer to as operating segments. We are seeking opportunities to enhance our current operating segments and to provide service in new geographic areas generally adjacent to existing coverage areas. From time to time, we may purchase spectrum and related assets from third parties or the FCC. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fully fund planned capital investments including geographical expansion.The construction of our network and the marketing and distribution of our wireless communications products and services have required, and will continue to require, substantial capital investment. Capital outlays have included license acquisition costs, capital expenditures for construction, increasing the capacity, or upgrade of our network infrastructure, including network infrastructure for 4G LTE, costs associated with clearing and relocating non-governmental incumbent licenses, funding of operating cash flow losses incurred as we launch services in new metropolitan areas and other working capital costs, debt service and financing fees and expenses. Our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $889.8 million, $790.4 million and $831.7 million, respectively. The expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were primarily associated with our efforts to increase the service area and capacity of our existing network and the upgrade of our network to 4G LTE. The expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2009 were primarily associated with the construction of the network infrastructure in the Philadelphia, New York and Boston metropolitan areas and 82Table of Contentsour efforts to increase the service area and capacity of our existing network. We believe the increased service area and capacity in existing markets will improve our service offerings, helping us to attract additional customers and retain existing customers resulting in increased revenues.As of December 31, 2011, we owed an aggregate of approximately $4.5 billion under our senior secured credit facility, as amended, 7 7/8% Senior Notes and 6 5/8% Senior Notes, as well as $281.2 million under our capital lease obligations.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities increased $67.3 million to approximately $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2011 from $994.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to a 56% increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, partially offset by an decrease in cash flows provided by changes in working capital during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010.Cash provided by operating activities increased $95.2 million to $994.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 from $899.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in operating income during the year ended December 31, 2010, partially offset by a decrease in cash flows provided by changes in working capital during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities increased $451.9 million to $899.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 from $447.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash flows from working capital changes and an increase in operating income during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008.Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities was $886.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $950.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. Cash flows provided by net purchases of short-term investments increased $224.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, partially offset by a $99.4 million increase in purchases of property and equipment and a $90.0 million increase in cash outflows from changes in prepaid purchases of property and equipment.Cash used in investing activities was $950.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to approximately $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was due primarily to a $74.8 million decrease in net purchases and maturities of short-term investments during the year ended December 31, 2010, coupled with a $61.3 million increase in cash flows from changes in prepaid purchases of property and equipment and a $41.3 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities was approximately $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to approximately $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was due primarily to a $313.0 million decrease in purchases of FCC licenses as well as a $122.9 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by an approximate $224.2 million increase in net purchases of short-term investments.Financing ActivitiesCash provided by financing activities was $971.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to cash used in financing activities of $176.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was due primarily to $961.7 million in net proceeds from debt issuance during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $47.4 million in net retirement of long-term debt during the same period in 2010 as well as a $86.2 million increase in cash provided by changes in book overdraft and a $49.0 million increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options.Cash used in financing activities was $176.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $449.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease during 2010 was mainly attributable to $2.0 billion in cash used for the redemption of the 9¼% Senior Notes as well as a $62.4 million decrease in book overdraft, partially offset by a net $1.5 billion increase in proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. Cash provided by financing activities was $449.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $74.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2008.

The senior secured credit facility consists of a $1.6 billion term loan facility and a $100 million revolving credit facility. The term loan facility is repayable in quarterly installments in annual aggregate amounts equal to 1% of the initial aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion. In July 2010, Wireless entered into the Amendment which amended and restated the senior secured credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity of the Tranche B-2 Term Loans under the senior secured credit facility to November 2016 as well as increase the interest rate to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 3.50% on the extended portion only and reduce the revolving credit facility from $100.0 million to $67.5 million. In March 2011, Wireless entered into the New Amendment which further amends and restates the senior secured credit facility, as amended, to, among other things, provide for the Tranche B-3 Term Loans, which will mature in March 2018 and have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75%. The New Amendment also increases the interest rate on the existing Tranche B-2 Term Loans under the senior secured credit facility, as amended, to LIBOR plus 3.821%. In addition, the aggregate amount of the revolving credit facility was increased from $67.5 million to $100.0 million and the maturity of the revolving credit facility was extended to March 2016. The New Amendment modified certain limitations under the senior secured credit facility, as amended, including limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, make certain restricted payments, sell assets, make certain investments or acquisitions, grant liens and pay dividends. In addition, Wireless is no longer subject to certain financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum senior secured consolidated leverage ratio. However, under certain circumstances, we could be subject to certain financial covenants that contain ratios based on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as defined by the senior secured credit facility, as amended. Under the New Amendment, the definition of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA has changed and no longer excludes interest and other income.In May 2011, Wireless entered into the Incremental Agreement which supplements the New Amendment to provide for the Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans which amount was borrowed on May 10, 2011. The Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% and will mature in March 2018. The Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans are repayable in quarterly installments of $2.5 million. A portion of the proceeds from the Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans were used to prepay the $535.8 million in outstanding principal under the Tranche B-1 Term Loans, with the remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes, including opportunistic spectrum acquisitions. The net proceeds from the Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans were $455.5 million after prepayment of the Tranche B-1 Term Loans, underwriter fees, other debt issuance costs of approximately $7.9 million. The Incremental Agreement did not modify the interest rate, maturity date or any of the other terms of the New Amendment applicable to the Tranche B-2 Term Loans or the existing Tranche B-3 Term Loans.The facilities under the senior secured credit agreement, as amended, are guaranteed by MetroPCS Communications, Inc., MetroPCS, Inc. and each of Wireless' direct and indirect present and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. The senior secured credit facility, as amended, contains customary events of default, including cross defaults. The obligations under the senior secured credit facility are also secured by the capital stock of Wireless as well as substantially all of the present and future assets of Wireless and each of its direct and indirect present and future wholly-owned subsidiaries (except as prohibited by law and certain permitted exceptions).In March 2009, Wireless entered into three separate two-year interest rate protection agreements to manage the Company's interest rate risk exposure under the senior secured credit facility, as amended. These agreements were effective on February 1, 2010 and covered a notional amount of $1.0 billion and effectively converted this portion of Wireless' variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at a weighted average annual rate of 5.927%. These agreements expired on February 1, 2012.In October 2010, Wireless entered into three separate two-year interest rate protection agreements to manage the Company's interest rate risk exposure under the senior secured credit facility, as amended.

The senior secured credit facility, as amended, bears interest at a floating rate tied to a fixed spread to LIBOR. The interest expense for the senior secured credit facility, as amended, presented in this table is based on rates at December 31, 2011 and includes the impact of our interest rate protection agreements.(2)Includes expected commitments for future capital lease obligations and purchases of network equipment.(3)Represents the liability reported in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740 (Topic 740, “Income Taxes”). For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 14, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.InflationWe believe that inflation has not materially affected our operations.Effect of New Accounting StandardsEffective January 1, 2011, the Company prospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2009-13, “Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements – a consensus of the EITF,” (“ASU 2009-13”) which amended ASC 605 (Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition”) to require overall arrangement consideration be allocated to each element in the multiple deliverable arrangement based on their relative selling prices, regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) or third party evidence (“TPE”). In the absence of VSOE or TPE, entities are required to estimate the selling prices of deliverables using management’s best estimates of the prices that would be charged on a standalone basis. The residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is eliminated; however the balance of revenue that can be recognized for the delivered element is limited to the non-contingent amount. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.86Table of ContentsIn May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, ""Fair Value Measurement - Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs,"" addressing how to measure fair value and what disclosures to provide about fair value measurements. This amendment is largely consistent with the existing GAAP guidance, but aligned the international guidance and eliminated unnecessary wording differences between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS""). The amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, and should be applied prospectively. The implementation of this standard will not affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05 ""Statement of Comprehensive Income,"" which revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements, requiring entities to report components of comprehensive income in either (1) a continuous statement of comprehensive income or (2) two separate but consecutive statements. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2011 and should be applied retrospectively. The implementation of this standard will not affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Fair Value MeasurementsWe do not expect changes in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets and liabilities to have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 9 to the financial statements included in this report.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, including interest rates. We do not routinely enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading, speculative or hedging purposes, unless it is hedging interest rate risk exposure or is required by our senior secured credit facility, as amended. We do not currently conduct business internationally, so we are generally not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk.As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $2.5 billion in outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility, as amended, that bears interest at floating rates based on LIBOR plus 3.821% for the Tranche B-2 Term Loans and LIBOR plus 3.75% for the Tranche B-3 Term Loans and Incremental Tranche B-3 Term Loans. The interest rate on the outstanding debt under our senior secured credit facility, as amended, as of December 31, 2011 was 5.065%, which includes the impact of our interest rate protection agreements. In March 2009, we entered into three separate two-year interest rate protection agreements to manage the Company's interest rate risk exposure. These agreements were effective on February 1, 2010 and cover a notional amount of $1.0 billion and effectively convert this portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at a weighted average annual rate of 5.927%. The monthly interest settlement periods began on February 1, 2010. These agreements expired on February 1, 2012. In April 2011, we entered into three separate three-year interest rate protection agreements to manage the Company's interest rate risk exposure under our senior secured credit facility, as amended. These agreements were effective on April 15, 2011 and cover a notional amount of $450.0 million and effectively convert this portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at a weighted average annual rate of 5.242%. The monthly interest settlement periods began on April 15, 2011. These agreements expire on April 15, 2014. If market LIBOR rates increase 100 basis points over the rates in effect at December 31, 2011, annual interest expense on the $1.0 billion in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate protection agreements would increase approximately $10.2 million.",2023-12-30 17:43:57.421699
