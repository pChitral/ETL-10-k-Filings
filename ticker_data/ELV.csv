1156039,ELV,"Elevance Health, Inc.",2003,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Introduction We are one of the nation’s largest health benefits companies and we operate as an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA. We offer Blue Cross Blue Shield branded products to customers throughout Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, Colorado, Nevada and Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.). As of December 31, 2002, we provided health benefit services to more than 11 million members of our health plans. Our health business segments are strategic business units delineated by geographic areas within which we offer similar products and services. We manage our health business segments with a local focus to address each market’s unique competitive, regulatory and healthcare delivery characteristics. Our health business segments are: Midwest, which includes Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio; East, which includes Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine; West, which includes Colorado and Nevada; and Southeast, which is Virginia, excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington D.C. In addition to our four health business segments, our reportable segments include a Specialty segment that is comprised of business units providing group life and disability insurance benefits, pharmacy benefit management, dental and vision administration services and behavioral health benefits services. During the third quarter of 2002, we sold our third party occupational health services businesses, which were part of our Specialty segment. The results of these businesses were not material to earnings of this segment or our consolidated results. Our Other segment is comprised of AdminaStar Federal, a subsidiary that administers Medicare programs in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and Ohio; intersegment revenue and expense eliminations; and corporate expenses not 38 Table of Contents allocated to our health or Specialty segments. In 2001, our Other segment also contained Anthem Alliance Health Insurance Company, or Anthem Alliance. Anthem Alliance primarily provided health care benefits and administration in nine states for the Department of Defense’s TRICARE Program for military families. We sold our TRICARE operations on May 31, 2001. We offer a diversified mix of managed care products such as preferred provider organizations or PPOs, health maintenance organizations or HMOs, point of service or POS plans and traditional indemnity benefits to members of our fully-insured products. We also provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded employers, including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management and other administrative services. Our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. The premiums come from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Our administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, from the administration of Medicare programs and from other health related businesses including disease management programs. Other revenue is principally generated from the mail-order sale of drugs by our pharmacy benefit management company. Our benefit expense consists of costs of care for health services consumed by our members for outpatient care, inpatient care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs, for example, are the cost of outpatient medical procedures, inpatient hospital stays, physician fees for office visits and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and vary with the age and health of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and customs in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense for each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported to us for reimbursement. Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members. Several economic factors related to health care costs such as regulatory mandates for coverage and direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating health care costs as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business. This management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. Significant Transactions On July 31, 2002, we completed the purchase of 100% of the outstanding stock of Trigon Healthcare, Inc., or Trigon, in accordance with an agreement and plan of merger announced April 29, 2002. Trigon was Virginia’s largest health benefits company and was the exclusive Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensee in Virginia, excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. The merger provides us with a new segment, our Southeast segment, with approximately 2.5 million members and a nearly forty percent share of the Virginia market. The Trigon merger allows us to further expand our licensed territory as a Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee. We believe the merger will enhance our earnings over time, as it will allow us opportunities to leverage our corporate and other fixed costs and to expand our specialty businesses. Trigon’s shareholders each received thirty dollars in cash and 1.062 shares of Anthem common stock for each Trigon share outstanding. The purchase price was approximately $4,038.1 million, which included cash of approximately $1,104.3 million, the issuance of approximately 39.0 million shares of Anthem common stock, valued at approximately $2,708.1 million, Trigon stock options converted into Anthem stock options for 39 Table of Contents approximately 3.9 million shares, valued at approximately $195.5 million and approximately $30.2 million of transaction costs. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this discussion for more information related to the sources of funds for this acquisition. See Notes 2 and 3 of our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K for additional information concerning the pro forma impact of Trigon on our consolidated financial statements. On May 31, 2001, we and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas, or BCBS-KS, announced that we had signed a definitive agreement pursuant to which BCBS-KS would become our wholly owned subsidiary. Under the proposed transaction, BCBS-KS would demutualize and convert to a stock insurance company. The agreement calls for us to pay $190.0 million in exchange for all of the shares of BCBS-KS. On February 11, 2002, the Kansas Insurance Commissioner disapproved the proposed transaction, which had been previously approved by the BCBS-KS policyholders in January 2002. On February 19, 2002, the board of directors of BCBS-KS voted unanimously to appeal the Kansas Insurance Commissioner’s decision and BCBS-KS sought to have the Commissioner’s decision overturned in Shawnee County District Court. We joined BCBS-KS in the appeal, which was filed on March 7, 2002. On June 7, 2002, the Shawnee County District Court ruled on the BCBS-KS appeal in favor of us and BCBS-KS. The Shawnee County District Court directed the Commissioner to re-evaluate her decision in accordance with the Court’s very specific interpretation of the Kansas law. On June 10, 2002, the Kansas Insurance Commissioner appealed the District Court’s ruling to the Kansas Supreme Court. The Kansas Supreme Court began to hear oral arguments of the parties to this case on March 5, 2003. Membership—December 31, 2002 Compared to December 31, 2001 Our membership includes seven different customer types: Local Large Group, Small Group, Individual, National Accounts, Medicare + Choice, Federal Employee Program and Medicaid. • Local Large Group consists of those customers with 51 or more employees eligible to participate as a member in one of our health plans. • Small Group consists of those customers with one to 50 eligible employees. • Individual members include those in our under age 65 business and our Medicare Supplement (age 65 and over) business. • National Accounts customers are employer groups which have multi-state locations and require partnering with other Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans for administration and/or access to non-Anthem provider networks. Included within the National Accounts business are our BlueCard customers who represent enrollees of health plans marketed by other Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans, or the home plans, who receive health care services in our Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensed markets. • Medicare + Choice members (age 65 and over) have enrolled in coverages that are managed care alternatives for the Medicare program. • The Federal Employee Program, or FEP, provides health insurance coverage to United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, or OPM. • Medicaid membership represents eligible members with state sponsored managed care alternatives in the Medicaid programs which we manage for the states of Connecticut, New Hampshire and Virginia. BlueCard membership, mentioned above as part of our National Accounts membership, is calculated based on the amount of BlueCard administrative fees we receive from the BlueCard members’ home plans. The administrative fees we receive are based on the number and type of claims we process, both institutional and professional, and a portion of the network discount on those claims from providers in our network who have provided service to BlueCard members. To calculate membership, administrative fees are divided by an average per member per month, or PMPM, factor. The average PMPM factor is determined using a historical average administrative fee per claim and an average number of claims per member per year based on our experience and BCBSA guidelines. 40 Table of Contents In addition to reporting our membership by customer type, we report membership by funding arrangement according to the level of risk we assume in the product contract. Our two funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain some or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some employers choose to purchase stop-loss coverage to limit their retained risk. The renewal patterns of our fully-insured Local Large Group and Small Group business, including our Southeast segment, are as follows: approximately 35% of renewals occur during the first quarter, approximately 18% of renewals occur during the second quarter, approximately 31% of renewals occur during the third quarter and approximately 16% of renewals occur during the fourth quarter. These renewal patterns have remained consistent over the past year and allow us to adjust our pricing and benefit plan designs in response to market conditions throughout the year. The following table presents our health membership count by segment, customer type and funding arrangement as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, comparing total and same-store membership respectively. We define same-store membership as our membership at a given period end in a segment or for a particular customer or funding type, after excluding the impact of members obtained through acquisitions or lost through dispositions during such period. We believe that same-store membership counts best capture the rate of organic growth of our operations period over period. The membership data presented is unaudited and in certain instances includes estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period, rounded to the nearest thousand.

(2) NM = Not meaningful. 41 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2002, total membership increased approximately 3.2 million, or 40%, primarily due to our acquisition of Trigon, which became our Southeast segment. On a same-store basis, total membership increased 621,000, or 8%, primarily in National Accounts, Individual and Local Large Group businesses. The following discussion of membership changes between periods excludes our Southeast members, which are identified separately in the table above. National Accounts membership increased 392,000, or 14%, primarily due to a significant increase in BlueCard activity. Individual membership increased 94,000, or 13%, with the majority of this growth resulting from higher sales in our under age 65 business in all segments due to the introduction of new, more affordable product designs and an overall increase in consumer awareness of our product offerings. Local Large Group membership increased 69,000, or 2%, primarily from sales to new fully-insured customers in our Midwest segment. In our Midwest segment, this growth was partially offset by a decrease in our self-funded business primarily as a result of pricing actions taken to better align our administrative fee revenue with costs of administering this business. Federal Employee Program membership increased 27,000, or 6%, primarily due to our concentrated effort to serve our customers well, fewer competitors in the market and new cost-effective product designs. Medicaid membership increased 18,000, or 15%, primarily due to the State of Connecticut’s broadening of eligibility standards and increased promotion of its Medicaid product. Small Group membership increased 15,000, or 2%, primarily in our Midwest segment. Medicare + Choice membership increased 6,000, or 6%. Our 2001 membership count included 6,000 Colorado Medicare + Choice members. As of January 1, 2002, we discontinued offering this product in Colorado. Excluding our withdrawal from this market, membership increased 12,000, or 13%. This increase was primarily due to new business in certain counties in Ohio, where many competitors have left the market, leaving us as one of the few remaining companies offering this product. Self-funded membership increased 399,000, or 10%, primarily due to an increase in National Accounts BlueCard activity. Fully-insured membership grew by 222,000 members, or 6%, primarily in our Individual and Local Large Group businesses, as explained above. 42 Table of Contents Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2001 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: Years Ended December 31 Change 2002 2001 $ % ($ in Millions, Except Per Share Data) Operating revenue and premium equivalents (1) $ 18,261.5 $ 14,057.4 $ 4,204.1 30 % Premiums $ 11,941.0 $ 9,244.8 $ 2,696.2 29 % Administrative fees 962.2 817.3 144.9 18 Other revenue 87.3 58.2 29.1 50 Total operating revenue 12,990.5 10,120.3 2,870.2 28 Benefit expense 9,839.4 7,814.7 2,024.7 26 Administrative expense 2,506.6 1,986.1 520.5 26 Total operating expense 12,346.0 9,800.8 2,545.2 26 Operating gain (2) 644.5 319.5 325.0 102 Net investment income 260.7 238.6 22.1 9 Net realized gains on investments 30.4 60.8 (30.4 ) (50 ) Gain on sale of subsidiary operations 0.7 25.0 (24.3 ) (97 ) Interest expense 98.5 60.2 38.3 64 Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 30.2 31.5 (1.3 ) (4 ) Demutualization expenses — 27.6 (27.6 ) NM (3) Income before taxes and minority interest 807.6 524.6 283.0 54 Income taxes 255.2 183.4 71.8 39 Minority interest (credit) 3.3 (1.0 ) 4.3 NM (3) Net income $ 549.1 $ 342.2 $ 206.9 60 % Average basic shares outstanding (in millions) (4) 119.0 103.3 15.7 15 % Average diluted shares outstanding (in millions) (4) 121.8 103.8 18.0 17 % Basic net income per share (4) $ 4.61 $ 3.31 $ 1.30 39 % Diluted net income per share (4) $ 4.51 $ 3.30 $ 1.21 37 % Benefit expense ratio (5) 82.4 % 84.5 % (210 ) bp (6) Administrative expense ratio: (7) Calculated using total operating revenue (8) 19.3 % 19.6 % (30 ) bp (6) Calculated using operating revenueand premium equivalents (9) 13.7 % 14.1 % (40 ) bp (6) Operating margin (10) 5.0 % 3.2 % 180 bp (6) The following definitions are also applicable to all other results of operations tables and schedules in this discussion: (1) Operating revenue and premium equivalents is a measure of the volume of business which is commonly used in the health benefits industry to allow for a comparison of operating efficiency among companies. It is obtained by adding to premiums, administrative fees and other revenue, the amount of claims attributable to non-Medicare, self-funded health business where we provide a complete array of customer service, claims administration and billing and enrollment services, but the customer retains the risk of funding payments for health benefits provided to members. The self-funded claims included for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $5,271.0 million (including $730.7 million from our Southeast segment). For the year ended December 31, 2001, self-funded benefits were $3,937.1 million. (2) Operating gain is a measure of operating performance of our business segments and represents total operating revenue less benefit expense and administrative expense. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains on investments, gain on sale of subsidiary operations, interest expense, 43 Table of Contents amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, demutualization expenses, income taxes and minority interest. Our definition of operating gain may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Further, operating gain should not be construed as a replacement for or equivalent to income before income taxes and minority interest, which is a measure of pretax profitability determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. (3) NM = Not meaningful. (4) December 31, 2001 amounts represent pro forma earnings per share including the period prior to our initial public offering. See Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (5) Benefit expense ratio = Benefit expense ÷ Premiums. (6) bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%. (7) While we include two calculations of administrative expense ratio, we believe that administrative expense ratio including premium equivalents is a better measure of efficiency as it eliminates changes in the ratio caused by changes in our mix of fully-insured and self-funded business. All discussions and explanations related to administrative expense ratio will be related to administrative expense ratio including premium equivalents. (8) Administrative expense ratio calculated using total operating revenue = Administrative expense ÷ Total operating revenue. (9) Administrative expense ratio calculated using operating revenue and premium equivalents = Administrative expense ÷ Operating revenue and premium equivalents. (10) Operating margin = Operating gain ÷ Total operating revenue. On May 31, 2001, we sold our TRICARE operations. The results of our TRICARE operations were reported in our Other segment during 2001 and included $263.2 million in operating revenue and $4.2 million in operating gain for the five months ended May 31, 2001. Throughout the following discussion of our results of operations, “same-store” excludes our TRICARE operations from 2001 and the operating results of our Trigon acquisition from the date of purchase in 2002. Premiums increased $2,696.2 million, or 29%, to $11,941.0 million in 2002. On a same-store basis, premiums increased $1,543.1 million, or 17%, due to premium rate increases and growth in our fully-insured membership. Our premium yields, net of benefit buy-downs for our fully-insured Local Large Group and Small Group businesses, increased approximately 14% on a rolling 12-month basis as of December 31, 2002, both on a same-store basis and after including Southeast premiums. Also contributing to premium growth was higher fully-insured membership in all of our business segments. Administrative fees increased $144.9 million, or 18%, including administrative fees following Trigon’s acquisition date in 2002. On a same-store basis, administrative fees increased $98.2 million, or 13%, primarily due to increased BlueCard activity and increased administrative fees from AdminaStar Federal’s 1-800 Medicare Help Line contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. During the fourth quarter of 2002, CMS awarded this contract to a different company, despite our superior performance ratings earned each year since receiving the contract in 1997. We will begin transitioning this contract to the new contractor beginning April 1, 2003. On a same-store basis, other revenue, which is comprised principally of co-pays and deductibles associated with Anthem Prescription Management’s, or APM’s, sale of mail-order drugs, increased $24.2 million, or 42%. Mail-order revenues increased primarily due to additional volume. APM launched mail conversion campaigns to inform members of the benefits and convenience of using APM’s mail-order pharmacy option during 2002. In addition, APM increased its penetration of our health benefits membership, with a resulting larger enrollment base and therefore greater demand for mail-order service. Benefit expense increased $2,024.7 million, or 26%, in 2002. On a same-store basis, benefit expense increased $1,132.7 million, or 15%, primarily due to increased cost of care trends and higher average 44 Table of Contents membership. Higher costs of care were driven primarily by higher costs in professional services and outpatient services. Our benefit expense ratio decreased 210 basis points from 84.5% in 2001 to 82.4% in 2002 due partly to the sale of our TRICARE operations in 2001 and the impact of our Trigon acquisition in 2002. On a same-store basis, our benefit expense ratio decreased 160 basis points from 84.2% in 2001 to 82.6% in 2002, primarily due to lower than anticipated medical costs in all of our business segments. Our 2002 benefit expense was also reduced by favorable developments of reserves reported as of December 31, 2001. The following discussion summarizes our aggregate cost of care trends for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2002, for our Local Large Group and Small Group fully-insured businesses only. Our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing per member per month claim costs for which Anthem is responsible, which excludes member co-payments and deductibles. Our aggregate cost of care trend including the impact of our Trigon acquisition for the entire rolling 12-month periods, including periods prior to July 31, 2002, was approximately 12%. Our aggregate cost of care trend excluding the impact of our Trigon acquisition was approximately one-half percentage point higher, driven primarily by professional services costs and outpatient services costs, weighted as a percentage of cost of care expense. Cost increases for professional services were approximately 12% including the impact of our Trigon acquisition for the entire rolling 12-month periods, including periods prior to July 31, 2002. Excluding the impact of our Trigon acquisition, our professional services trend was approximately one and one-half percentage points higher. This trend is due to both higher utilization and higher unit costs. Utilization increases were driven primarily by increases in physician office visits, radiology procedures such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging procedures, or MRIs, Positron Emission Tomography procedures, or PET scans, and laboratory procedures. Unit cost increases were driven primarily by increases in physician fee reimbursement schedules. In response to increasing professional services costs, we continue to work with our providers through education and contracting to ensure that our members receive the most appropriate care at the proper time in the appropriate clinical setting. Cost increases for outpatient services were approximately 12% including the impact of our Trigon acquisition for the entire rolling 12-month periods, including periods prior to July 31, 2002. Excluding the impact of our Trigon acquisition, our outpatient services trend was approximately one percentage point higher. Drivers of this outpatient trend include a continuing shift of certain procedures such as certain cardiac care procedures previously performed in an inpatient setting to an outpatient setting and increased cost of emergency room services as more procedures are being performed at each emergency room visit. Costs are also increasing for outpatient surgery and radiology services. Pharmacy costs increased by approximately 16% including the impact of our Trigon acquisition for the entire rolling 12-month periods, including periods prior to July 31, 2002. Excluding the impact of our Trigon acquisition, our pharmacy cost trend remained consistent at approximately 16%. Increases were primarily due to the introduction of new, higher cost drugs and higher overall utilization as a result of increases in direct-to-consumer advertising by pharmaceutical companies and expanded physician-prescribed use of drugs that manage chronic conditions such as high cholesterol. In response to increasing pharmacy costs, we are evaluating different plan designs, recontracting with retail pharmacies and continuing the implementation of tiered drug benefits for our members. Three-tier drug programs reflect benefit designs that have three different co-payment levels, which depend on the drug selected. Generic drugs have the lowest co-payment, brand name drugs included in the drug formulary have a higher co-payment and brand name drugs omitted from the drug formulary have the highest co-payment. Drug formularies are lists of prescription drugs that have been reviewed and selected for their quality and effectiveness by a committee of community-based practicing physicians and clinical pharmacists. Through our pharmacy benefit design, we encourage use of these formulary listed brand name and generic drugs to ensure members receive quality and cost-effective medication. The favorable impact of three-tier drug programs on prescription drug cost trends is most significant in the first year of implementation. Excluding the impact of our Trigon acquisition, we have already implemented three-tier drug programs for approximately 66% of our members as of December 31, 2002, as compared to approximately 60% of our members as of December 31, 2001. 45 Table of Contents Inpatient services costs increased approximately 9% including the impact of our Trigon acquisition for the entire rolling 12-month periods, including periods prior to July 31, 2002. Excluding the impact of our Trigon acquisition, our inpatient services trend was approximately one percentage point lower. Approximately two thirds of this trend resulted from unit cost increases and approximately one third of this trend resulted from utilization increases. The cost trend was primarily due to a health care industry shift of lower-cost procedures to outpatient settings, leaving more expensive procedures performed in inpatient settings. In addition, growth in inpatient trend was due to implementation of new provider contracts that reflect the hospital industry’s more aggressive stance in their contracting with health benefit companies. Utilization increases resulted primarily from increases in the frequency of inpatient surgeries. We are implementing advanced care management programs and disease management programs which have been proven to reduce deterioration in health and the need for hospitalization. As a result of these programs, hospital utilization has been essentially stable. Administrative expense increased $520.5 million, or 26%, in 2002. On a same-store basis, administrative expense increased $319.6 million, or 17%, primarily due to higher salary cost and merit increases, other volume sensitive costs such as higher commissions and premium taxes and higher incentive compensation costs associated with above targeted results. On a same-store basis, our administrative expense ratio, calculated using operating revenue and premium equivalents, remained consistent with 2001 at 14.0%. Net investment income increased $22.1 million, or 9%. This increase in investment income primarily resulted from the investment of additional assets in 2002 from our Trigon acquisition, which was partially offset by decreased average yield from investment securities. Also contributing to the increase was the impact of an increased allocation of fixed income securities as a percentage of our investment portfolio during the third quarter of 2001. As yields on investment securities are dependent on market interest rates and changes in interest rates are unpredictable, there is no certainty that past investment performance will be repeated in the future. Net realized gains on investments decreased $30.4 million, or 50%. A summary is as follows: Years Ended December 31 2002 2001 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities $ 0.6 $ 69.0 $ (68.4 ) (99 )% Net realized gains from the sale of fixed maturity securities 32.9 20.7 12.2 59 % Other than temporary impairments (3.1 ) (28.9 ) 25.8 89 % Net realized gains on investments $ 30.4 $ 60.8 $ (30.4 ) (50 )% Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities decreased $68.4 million primarily due to our realization of $65.2 million of gains in 2001 resulting from the restructuring of our portfolio. In 2002, we realized a $3.1 million loss on a limited partnership, and in 2001 we recognized $28.9 million of impairment losses on equity securities. Net realized gains or losses on investments are influenced by market conditions when an investment is sold or deemed to be impaired, and will vary from period to period. Our gain on the sale of subsidiary operations of $0.7 million in 2002 related primarily to the sale of our third party occupational health services businesses, and the $25.0 million gain in 2001 relates to the sale of our TRICARE operations on May 31, 2001. Interest expense increased $38.3 million, or 64%, primarily reflecting additional interest expense incurred on the debt issued in conjunction with our Trigon acquisition and the issuance of our 6.00% Equity Security Units on November 2, 2001. 46 Table of Contents Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets decreased $1.3 million. Due to our adoption of FAS 142 on January 1, 2002, amortization decreased approximately $17.5 million. This decrease was partially offset by $16.2 million of new amortization expense, including $15.8 million of amortization expense on intangible assets resulting from our Trigon acquisition. See Notes 2 and 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K for additional information concerning our adoption of FAS 142. Demutualization expenses associated with our conversion from a mutual insurance company to a stockholder owned company on November 2, 2001 totaled $27.6 million in 2001. Income tax expense increased $71.8 million, or 39%, primarily due to increased income before taxes. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 31.6% in 2002 from 35.0% in 2001. This 340 basis point decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to the reduction of a deferred tax valuation allowance in 2002 due to our continued improvement in taxable earnings, nondeductible demutualization expenses incurred during 2001 and the impact of FAS 142. Net income increased $206.9 million, or 60%, primarily due to our Trigon acquisition, the improvement in our operating results in each health business segment as described below, higher net investment income, lower amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from the adoption of FAS 142 on January 1, 2002 and our reduced effective tax rate. Assuming FAS 142 had been in effect for the year ended December 31, 2001, our net income would have increased $191.8 million, or 54%. Both basic and fully diluted earnings per share increased as a result of increased net income as described above and the impact of our stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program in 2002. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the number of average shares outstanding due to the stock issued in conjunction with our Trigon acquisition on July 31, 2002, and an increase in the effect of dilutive securities. Midwest Our Midwest segment is comprised of health benefit and related business for members in Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. Our Midwest segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: Years Ended December 31 2002 2001 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating Revenue $ 6,051.4 $ 5,093.0 $ 958.4 19 % Operating Gain $ 271.6 $ 161.5 $ 110.1 68 % Operating Margin 4.5 % 3.2 % 130 bp Membership (in 000s) 5,234 4,854 380 8 % Operating revenue increased $958.4 million, or 19%, primarily due to premium rate increases in our Local Large Group and Small Group businesses and membership increases in our Local Large Group fully-insured and Individual businesses. Operating gain increased $110.1 million, or 68%, primarily due to improved underwriting results in our Local Large Group fully-insured and Small Group businesses. Our operating gain was also impacted by the recognition of a $15.7 million favorable adjustment for prior year reserve releases recognized in the third quarter of 2002 and an $11.2 million strengthening of reserves during the third quarter of 2001. Operating gain improvements were partially offset by a $23.0 million unfavorable adjustment recorded during the third quarter of 2002 to reflect the accrual of additional premium taxes in the state of Ohio. 47 Table of Contents Membership increased 380,000, or 8%, primarily due to additional BlueCard activity and enrollment gains in our Local Large Group fully-insured and Individual businesses. Individual sales benefited from the introduction of new, lower premium products. Our Midwest segment experienced a decrease in Local Large Group self-funded membership, which was anticipated and was a result of pricing actions designed to better align revenue with costs of services to this membership class. East Our East segment is comprised of health benefit and related business for members in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine. Our East segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: Years Ended December 31 2002 2001 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating Revenue $ 4,151.5 $ 3,667.3 $ 484.2 13 % Operating Gain $ 222.9 $ 128.8 $ 94.1 73 % Operating Margin 5.4 % 3.5 % 190 bp Membership (in 000s) 2,434 2,260 174 8 % Operating revenue increased $484.2 million, or 13%, primarily due to premium rate increases, particularly in our Local Large Group and Small Group businesses. Operating gain increased $94.1 million, or 73%, primarily due to improved underwriting results, particularly in our Individual and Local Large Group businesses, and an unfavorable reserve strengthening adjustment of $9.4 million recorded during the third quarter of 2001. Membership increased 174,000, or 8%, primarily due to increased BlueCard activity and enrollment gains in our Local Large Group self-funded business. Our growth in Local Large Group self-funded business primarily resulted from changes in our Local Large Group mix of business from fully-insured to self-funded. On February 28, 2002, a subsidiary of Anthem Insurance, Anthem Health Plans of Maine, Inc., completed its purchase of the remaining 50% ownership interest in Maine Partners Health Plan, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of $10.6 million. We had previously consolidated the financial results of this entity in our consolidated financial statements and recorded minority interest for the percentage we did not own. West Our West segment is comprised of health benefit and related business for members in Colorado and Nevada. Our West segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: Years Ended December 31 2002 2001 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating Revenue $ 920.1 $ 774.4 $ 145.7 19 % Operating Gain $ 74.7 $ 20.1 $ 54.6 272 % Operating Margin 8.1 % 2.6 % 550 bp Membership (in 000s) 836 769 67 9 % Operating revenue increased by $145.7 million, or 19%, primarily due to higher premium rates particularly in our Local Large Group fully-insured and Small Group businesses, and higher membership in our Individual business. 48 Table of Contents Operating gain increased $54.6 million to $74.7 million in 2002, primarily due to improved underwriting results in our Local Large Group fully-insured and Small Group businesses. Also contributing to the improvement was $10.9 million in favorable prior year reserve releases recorded during the third quarter of 2002. These reserve releases were offset by a $10.1 million reserve increase for case specific reserves incurred during the normal course of business. Membership increased 67,000, or 9%, primarily due to increased BlueCard activity and higher sales in our Individual business. Southeast Our Southeast segment is comprised of health benefit and related business for members in Virginia, excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington D.C. Our Southeast segment’s summarized results of operations for the five months ended December 31, 2002 are as follows: Five Months Ended December 31, 2002 ($ in Millions) Operating Revenue $ 1,467.9 Operating Gain $ 116.0 Operating Margin 7.9 % Membership (in 000s) 2,549 Our Southeast segment was established with the acquisition of Trigon on July 31, 2002. Results of operations for this segment have been included in our consolidated financial statements from August 1, 2002 forward. These five months of operating results may not be sustainable or indicative of future performance, as we are in the early stages of transitioning business practices and policies that will govern our Southeast segment’s operations. Our integration activities remain on schedule, and we expect to achieve $40.0 million to $50.0 million of synergies in 2003 and at least $75.0 million by 2004. We captured approximately $11.0 million of synergies in 2002, primarily related to corporate overhead and information technology cost savings. Specialty Our Specialty segment includes our group life and disability insurance benefits, pharmacy benefit management, dental and vision administration services and behavioral health benefits services. During the third quarter of 2002, we sold our third party occupational health services businesses, the operating results of which were not material to the earnings of this segment or our consolidated results. On June 1, 2002, we acquired certain assets of PRO Behavioral Health, or PRO, a Denver, Colorado-based behavioral health company in order to broaden our specialty product offerings. Results from this acquisition are included from that date forward and are not material to the operating revenue or operating gain of this segment in the year ended December 31, 2002. Our Specialty segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: Years Ended December 31 $ Change % Change 2002 2001 ($ in Millions) Operating Revenue $ 523.5 $ 396.1 $ 127.4 32 % Operating Gain $ 50.7 $ 32.9 $ 17.8 54 % Operating Margin 9.7 % 8.3 % 140 bp Operating revenue increased $127.4 million, or 32%, primarily due to increased mail-order prescription volume at APM. APM launched mail-order campaigns to inform members of the benefits and convenience of 49 Table of Contents using APM’s mail-order pharmacy option for maintenance drugs. In addition, APM increased its penetration of our health benefits members. APM implemented its pharmacy benefit programs in our West segment and in Maine during the first six months of 2001. Excluding the impact of our TRICARE operations, mail-service prescription volume increased 29% and retail prescription volume increased 10%. Operating gain increased $17.8 million, or 54%, primarily due to increased mail-order prescription volume and additional margin resulting from further penetration of generic drug prescriptions at APM. Improved results in the life and dental businesses also contributed to the growth in operating gain, which was modestly offset by start-up and integration expenses associated with our behavioral health, vision and dental operations. Other Our Other segment includes AdminaStar Federal, a subsidiary that administers Medicare programs in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and Ohio; elimination of intersegment revenue and expenses; and corporate expenses not allocated to operating segments. In 2001, our Other segment also contained Anthem Alliance, a subsidiary that provided the health care benefits and administration in nine states for active and retired military employees and their dependents under the Department of Defense’s TRICARE program for military families. Our TRICARE operations were sold on May 31, 2001. Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: Years Ended December 31 $ Change % Change 2002 2001 ($ in Millions) Operating Revenue $ (123.9 ) $ 189.5 $ (313.4 ) (165 %) Operating Loss $ (91.4 ) $ (23.8 ) $ (67.6 ) (284 %) Operating revenue decreased $313.4 million to $(123.9) million in 2002 from $189.5 million in 2001. Excluding intersegment operating revenue eliminations of $302.1 million in 2002 and $214.0 million in 2001, operating revenue decreased $225.3 million, or 56%, primarily due to the sale of our TRICARE operations. Excluding our TRICARE operations from 2001 and intersegment operating revenue eliminations, operating revenue increased $37.9 million, or 27%, primarily due to revenue from our AdminaStar Federal’s 1-800 Medicare Help Line contract. This contract is with CMS for our operation of the 1-800 Medicare Help Line. During the fourth quarter of 2002, CMS awarded this contract to a different company, despite our superior performance ratings earned each year since receiving the contract in 1997. We will begin transitioning this contract to the new contractor beginning April 1, 2003. Operating loss increased $67.6 million primarily due to higher unallocated corporate expenses and the absence of TRICARE operating gain. These unallocated expenses accounted for $91.3 million in 2002 and $33.0 million in 2001. This increase in unallocated corporate expenses was primarily related to higher incentive compensation costs associated with better than expected operating results. Also contributing to this increased operating loss was the reduction in our carrying value of our investment in MedUnite. Membership—December 31, 2001 Compared to December 31, 2000 We categorized our membership into eight different customer types: Local Large Group, Small Group, Individual, National Accounts, Medicare + Choice, Federal Employee Program, Medicaid and TRICARE. The first seven customer types are consistent with those described in the “Membership—December 31, 2002 Compared to December 31, 2001” discussion. Our TRICARE program provided managed care services to active and retired military personnel and their dependents. We sold our TRICARE business on May 31, 2001, and thus we had no TRICARE members as of December 31, 2001. The following table presents our membership count by segment, customer type and funding arrangement as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, comparing total and same-store membership respectively. We define same-store 50 Table of Contents membership as our membership at a given period end in a segment or for a particular customer or funding type, after excluding the impact of members obtained through acquisitions or lost through dispositions during such period. We believe that same-store membership counts best capture the rate of organic growth of our operations period over period. The membership data presented is unaudited and in certain instances includes estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period, rounded to the nearest thousand.

(2) NM = Not meaningful. During the year ended December 31, 2001, total membership increased 613,000, or 8%, primarily due to growth in National Accounts business and Local Large Group, including a significant increase in BlueCard activity. On a same-store basis, membership increased 741,000, or 10%. Local Large Group membership increased 193,000, or 7%, with growth in all regions attributable to the success of our PPO products, as more employer groups desire the broad, open access to our networks provided by these products. The 38,000, or 5%, growth in Small Group business reflects our initiatives to increase Small Group membership through revised commission structures, enhanced product offerings, brand promotion and enhanced relationships with brokers. Medicare + Choice membership decreased as we withdrew from the Connecticut Medicare + Choice program effective January 1, 2001. At December 31, 2000, our Medicare + Choice membership in Connecticut 51 Table of Contents totaled 18,000. Offsetting this decrease was growth in our Medicare + Choice membership in certain counties in Ohio, where many competitors have left the market, leaving us as one of the few remaining companies offering this product. As of January 1, 2002, we exited the Colorado Medicare + Choice market. Our 2001 membership count included 6,000 Colorado Medicare + Choice members. Individual membership increased primarily due to new business resulting from higher sales of Individual under age 65 products, particularly in our Midwest segment. Self-funded membership increased primarily due to our 23% increase in BlueCard membership. Fully-insured membership, excluding TRICARE, grew by 170,000 members, or 5%, from December 31, 2000, due to growth in both Local Large and Small Group businesses, as explained above. 52 Table of Contents Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2000 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 are as follows: Years Ended December 31 Change 2001 2000 $ % ($ in Millions, Except Per Share Data) Operating revenue and premium equivalents (1) $ 14,057.4 $ 11,800.1 $ 2,257.3 19 % Premiums $ 9,244.8 $ 7,737.3 $ 1,507.5 19 % Administrative fees 817.3 755.6 61.7 8 Other revenue 58.2 50.6 7.6 15 Total operating revenue 10,120.3 8,543.5 1,576.8 18 Benefit expense 7,814.7 6,551.0 1,263.7 19 Administrative expense 1,986.1 1,808.4 177.7 10 Total operating expense 9,800.8 8,359.4 1,441.4 17 Operating gain (2) 319.5 184.1 135.4 74 Net investment income 238.6 201.6 37.0 18 Net realized gains on investments 60.8 25.9 34.9 135 Gain on sale of subsidiary operations 25.0 — 25.0 NM (3) Interest expense 60.2 54.7 5.5 10 Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 31.5 27.1 4.4 16 Demutualization expenses 27.6 — 27.6 NM (3) Income before taxes and minority interest 524.6 329.8 194.8 59 Income taxes 183.4 102.2 81.2 79 Minority interest (credit) (1.0 ) 1.6 (2.6 ) NM (3) Net income $ 342.2 $ 226.0 $ 116.2 51 % Average basic shares outstanding (in millions) (4) 103.3 103.3 — NM (3) Average diluted shares outstanding (in millions) (4) 103.8 103.8 — NM (3) Basic net income per share (4) $ 3.31 $ 2.19 $ 1.12 51 % Diluted net income per share (4) $ 3.30 $ 2.18 $ 1.12 51 % Benefit expense ratio (5) 84.5 % 84.7 % (20 ) bp (6) Administrative expense ratio: (7) Calculated using total operating revenue (8) 19.6 % 21.2 % (160 ) bp (6) Calculated using operating revenueand premium equivalents (9) 14.1 % 15.3 % (120 ) bp (6) Operating margin (10) 3.2 % 2.2 % 100 bp (6) (1) The self-funded claims included for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $3,937.1 million and for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $3,256.6 million.

See Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. For the remaining footnote explanations, see table in the “Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001” discussion. On May 31, 2001, we sold our TRICARE operations. The results of our TRICARE operations were reported in our Other segment during 2001 and included $263.2 million in operating revenue and $4.2 million in operating gain for the five months ended May 31, 2001. The results of our TRICARE operations for the year ended 53 Table of Contents December 31, 2000 were $353.9 million in operating revenue and $3.9 million in operating gain, and were included partially in our Other segment and due to various intercompany reinsurance and service agreements which were in place during 2000 were partially recorded in our Midwest health business segment during 2000. On June 5, 2000, we completed the purchase of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maine, or BCBS-ME. We accounted for this acquisition as a purchase and we included the net assets and results of operations in our consolidated financial statements from the date of purchase. The results of BCBS-ME for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $948.1 million in total revenue and $12.6 million in operating gain. The results of BCBS-ME from June 5, 2000 through December 31, 2000 were $489.4 million in total revenue and $8.7 million in operating gain. Premiums increased $1,507.5 million, or 19%, in part due to our acquisition of BCBS-ME in June 2000 and the additional risk we assumed as of January 1, 2001, associated with the TRICARE business. Our subsidiary Anthem Alliance had retained 35% of the risk on its TRICARE contract as of January 1, 2000, and we increased the retention as of January 1, 2001, to 90% of the total risk for the contract. We sold the TRICARE business on May 31, 2001. Excluding our acquisition of BCBS-ME and our TRICARE operating results, premiums increased $1,089.5 million, or 15%, due to premium rate increases and higher membership in all of our health business segments. Administrative fees increased $61.7 million, or 8%, with $30.2 million of this increase from our acquisition of BCBS-ME. Excluding our acquisition of BCBS-ME and our TRICARE operating results, administrative fees increased $112.2 million, or 20%, primarily from increased Local Large Group self-funded and BlueCard activity. Excluding our acquisition of BCBS-ME and our TRICARE operating results, other revenue, which is comprised principally of APM’s sale of mail-order drugs, increased $12.1 million, or 27%. Mail-order revenues increased primarily due to additional volume resulting from the introduction of APM as the pharmacy benefit manager at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Hampshire, or BCBS-NH, in late 2000 and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Colorado and Nevada, or BCBS-CO/NV, and BCBS-ME in the first six months of 2001. Benefit expense increased $1,263.7 million, or 19%, in 2001 primarily due to our acquisition of BCBS-ME and the additional risk assumed by Anthem Alliance for TRICARE business on January 1, 2001. Excluding our acquisition of BCBS-ME and our TRICARE operating results, benefit expense increased $888.6 million, or 15%, primarily due to higher average membership and increasing cost of care. Cost of care trends were driven primarily by higher utilization of outpatient services and higher prescription drug costs. Our benefit expense ratio decreased 20 basis points from 84.7% in 2000 to 84.5% in 2001 primarily due to disciplined pricing, implementation of disease management plans and improvement in provider contracting. Excluding our acquisition of BCBS-ME and our TRICARE operating results, our benefit expense ratio decreased 40 basis points from 84.3% in 2000 to 83.9% in 2001 for the same reasons. The following discussion summarizes our aggregate cost of care trends for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2001 for our Local Large Group and Small Group fully-insured businesses only. Cost increases have varied among segments and products. Our aggregate cost of care trend was approximately 13%, driven primarily by pharmacy and outpatient costs. After taking changes in our mix of business between regions into consideration, our aggregate cost of care trend was approximately 12%. Pharmacy cost trends for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2001 generally averaged from 16% to 17%. The cost increases resulted from the introduction of new, higher cost drugs and higher overall utilization as a result of increases in direct-to-consumer advertising by pharmaceutical companies. In response to increasing prescription drug costs, we have implemented three-tier drug programs and expanded the use of formularies for our members. For the 12-month period ended December 31, 2001, outpatient services cost trends generally averaged from 14% to 15%. These increases resulted from both increased utilization and higher unit costs. Increased outpatient 54 Table of Contents utilization reflects an industry-wide trend toward a broader range of medical procedures being performed without overnight hospital stays, as well as an increasing customer awareness of and demand for diagnostic procedures such as magnetic resonance imagings, or MRIs. In addition, improved medical technology has allowed more complicated medical procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis rather than on an inpatient (hospitalized) basis, increasing both outpatient utilization rates and unit costs. For the 12-month period ended December 31, 2001, professional services cost trends generally averaged from 11% to 12%. These increases resulted from both increased utilization and higher unit costs. For the 12-month period ended December 31, 2001, inpatient services trends were approximately 11%. This increase was due to re-negotiation of provider contracts and higher overall utilization, particularly for cardiac services admissions. Hospitals have taken a more aggressive stance in their contracting with health insurance companies as a result of reduced hospital reimbursements from Medicare and pressure to recover the costs of additional investments in new medical technology and facilities. Administrative expense increased $177.7 million, or 10%, in 2001, which includes the impacts of our acquisition of BCBS-ME and our TRICARE operating results. Excluding our acquisition of BCBS-ME and our TRICARE operating results, administrative expense increased $194.0 million, or 12%, primarily due to higher commissions and premium taxes, which vary with premium, higher salary and benefit costs, additional costs associated with higher membership and investments in technology. Our administrative expense ratio, calculated using operating revenue and premium equivalents, decreased 120 basis points primarily due to operating revenue increasing faster than administrative expense. Net investment income increased $37.0 million, or 18%, primarily due to our higher investment portfolio balances. The higher portfolio balances included net cash generated from operations, as well as cash generated from improved balance sheet management, such as quicker collection of receivables and liquidation of non-strategic assets. Excluding the investment income earned by BCBS-ME and TRICARE, net investment income increased $31.7 million, or 16%. As returns on fixed maturity portfolios are dependent on market interest rates and changes in interest rates are unpredictable, there is no certainty that past investment performance will be repeated in the future. Net realized gains on investments increased $34.9 million, or 135%. A summary is as follows: Years Ended December 31 2001 2000 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities $ 69.0 $ 43.5 $ 25.5 59 % Net realized gains (losses) from the sale of fixed maturity securities 20.7 (17.6 ) 38.3 NM (3) Other than temporary impairments (28.9 ) — (28.9 ) NM (3) Net realized gains on investments $ 60.8 $ 25.9 $ 34.9 135 % In 2001, the net realized gains from the sale of equity securities primarily consisted of $65.2 million of gains resulting from the restructuring of our equity portfolio into fixed maturity securities and equity index funds in the early to mid third quarter of 2001. During the second quarter of 2001, we recognized $28.9 million of losses on equity securities as other than temporary impairment. Net gains or losses on investments are influenced by market conditions when an investment is sold, and will vary from year to year. Our gain on the sale of subsidiary operations of $25.0 million in 2001 relates to the sale of our TRICARE operations on May 31, 2001. 55 Table of Contents Interest expense increased $5.5 million, or 10%, primarily reflecting the issuance of our 6.00% Equity Security Units on November 2, 2001 and the commitment fee associated with our new $800.0 million line of credit. Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets increased $4.4 million, or 16%, primarily due to amortization expense associated with our acquisition of BCBS-ME. As we adopted FAS 142 on January 1, 2002, this standard did not have any effect on these results. See Notes 1, 2 and 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K for additional information concerning our adoption of FAS 142. Demutualization expenses associated with our conversion from a mutual insurance company to a stockholder-owned company on November 2, 2001 totaled $27.6 million in 2001. Income tax expense increased $81.2 million, or 79%, primarily due to higher income before taxes. Our effective income tax rate in 2001 was 35.0% and was 31.0% in 2000. Our rate was lower than the statutory effective tax rate in 2000 primarily as a result of changes in our deferred tax valuation allowance. Our effective tax rate increased in 2001 primarily due to the non-deductibility of demutualization expenses and a portion of goodwill amortization for income tax purposes. Net income increased $116.2 million, or 51%, primarily due to the improvement in our operating results, net realized capital gains, gain on sale of subsidiary operations and higher investment income. Excluding the gain on the sale of our TRICARE business ($16.3 million after tax), net realized gains on investments and demutualization expenses, net income increased $105.0 million, or 51%. Both basic and fully diluted earnings per share increased as a result of increased net income as described above. December 31, 2001 and 2000 amounts represent pro forma earnings per share, which includes earnings prior to our initial public offering. See Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Midwest Our Midwest segment is comprised of health benefit and related business for members in Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. Our Midwest segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 are as follows: Years Ended December 31 $ Change % Change 2001 2000 ($ in Millions) Operating Revenue $ 5,093.0 $ 4,460.5 $ 632.5 14 % Operating Gain $ 161.5 $ 87.8 $ 73.7 84 % Operating Margin 3.2 % 2.0 % 120 bp Membership (in 000s) 4,854 4,454 (1) 400 9 % (1) Excludes 128,000 TRICARE members. Operating revenue increased $632.5 million, or 14%, due primarily to premium rate increases in our Local Large Group and Small Group businesses and the effect of higher average membership in our Medicare + Choice business. Operating gain increased $73.7 million, or 84%, resulting in an operating margin of 3.2% at December 31, 2001, a 120 basis point improvement from the year ended December 31, 2000. This improvement was primarily due to revenue growth and effective expense control. Administrative expense increased at a slower rate than premiums as we gained operating efficiencies and leveraged our fixed costs over higher membership. 56 Table of Contents Our Midwest segment assumed a portion of the risk for Anthem Alliance’s TRICARE contract until December 31, 2000. Effective January 1, 2001, Anthem Alliance reassumed this risk. For the year ended December 31, 2000, our Midwest segment received $122.1 million of premium income, no administrative fees or other income, incurred $113.8 million of benefit expense and $7.4 million of administrative expense, resulting in a $0.9 million operating gain on the TRICARE contract. We also had 128,000 TRICARE members included in our Midwest segment’s membership at December 31, 2000, and no members at December 31, 2001. Excluding TRICARE, membership increased 400,000, or 9%, primarily due to higher BlueCard activity, higher sales in National Accounts business and higher sales and favorable retention of Local Large Group business. East Our East segment is comprised of health benefit and related business for members in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine. BCBS-ME is included from its acquisition date of June 5, 2000. Our East segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 are as follows: Years Ended December 31 $ Change % Change 2001 2000 ($ in Millions) Operating Revenue $ 3,667.3 $ 2,921.9 $ 745.4 26 % Operating Gain $ 128.8 $ 103.8 $ 25.0 24 % Operating Margin 3.5 % 3.6 % (10 ) bp Membership (in 000s) 2,260 2,093 167 8 % Operating revenue increased $745.4 million, or 26%. Excluding our acquisition of BCBS-ME in June 2000 and the effect of our exit from the Medicare + Choice business in Connecticut on January 1, 2001, operating revenue increased $449.0 million, or 20%, primarily due to premium rate increases in our Local Large Group business and higher average membership in our Local Large Group and Small Group businesses. Operating gain increased $25.0 million, or 24%, primarily due to improved underwriting results in our Local Large Group fully-insured business, exiting the Medicare + Choice market in Connecticut, and higher overall membership. Operating margin decreased 10 basis points primarily due to the relatively lower margins on our Maine business. Membership increased 167,000, or 8%, primarily due to increased sales of Local Large Group business and growth in BlueCard activity. Local Large Group sales in our East segment increased primarily due to the withdrawal of two of our largest competitors from the New Hampshire and Maine markets. West Our West segment is comprised of health benefit and related business for members in Colorado and Nevada. Our West segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 are as follows: Years Ended December 31 $ Change % Change 2001 2000 ($ in Millions) Operating Revenue $ 774.4 $ 622.4 $ 152.0 24 % Operating Gain $ 20.1 $ 2.5 $ 17.6 704 % Operating Margin 2.6 % 0.4 % 220 bp Membership (in 000s) 769 595 174 29 % 57 Table of Contents Operating revenue increased $152.0 million, or 24%, primarily due to higher premium rates designed to bring our pricing in line with cost of care and higher membership in our Local Large Group and Small Group businesses. Operating gain increased $17.6 million to $20.1 million in 2001, primarily due to improved underwriting performance as a result of premium rate increases exceeding cost of care increases and higher average membership. This improvement in our operating gain resulted in a 220 basis point increase in operating margin to 2.6% in 2001. Membership increased 174,000, or 29%, due to increased BlueCard activity, higher sales in Local Large Group and Small Group businesses and favorable retention in National Accounts business. We exited the Medicare + Choice market in Colorado effective January 1, 2002. At December 31, 2001, our Medicare + Choice membership in Colorado was approximately 6,000. We entered into an agreement with Sloan’s Lake HMO in Colorado for the conversion of Sloan’s Lake HMO business effective January 1, 2001. The terms of the agreement include payment to Sloan’s Lake for each member selecting our product at the group’s renewal date and continuing as our member for a minimum of nine months. Through December 31, 2001, we added approximately 35,000 members from Sloan’s Lake. Specialty Our Specialty segment includes our group life and disability insurance benefits, pharmacy benefit management, dental and vision administration services and third party occupational health services. Our Specialty segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 are as follows: Years Ended December 31 $ Change % Change 2001 2000 ($ in Millions) Operating Revenue $ 396.1 $ 332.3 $ 63.8 19 % Operating Gain $ 32.9 $ 24.9 $ 8.0 32 % Operating Margin 8.3 % 7.5 % 80 bp Operating revenue increased $63.8 million, or 19%, primarily due to higher revenue at APM. APM’s operating revenue grew primarily due to increased mail-order prescription volume and the implementation of APM’s pharmacy benefit programs beginning in 2001 by BCBS-CO/NV and BCBS-ME, and in late 2000 by BCBS-NH. Mail-service membership increased 28%, while retail-service membership decreased 13%. Mail-service prescription volume increased 38% and retail prescription volume increased 31%. This growth more than offset the effect of the termination of a special funding arrangement with a large life group on December 31, 2000, which decreased premiums by $28.8 million, or 23%. This group accounted for $35.9 million of life and disability premiums for 2000 and contributed very low margins to our Specialty segment’s profitability. Operating gain increased $8.0 million, or 32%, primarily due to increased mail-order prescription volume at APM. Improved APM results, coupled with the termination of the large life group, resulted in an 80 basis point increase in our operating margin to 8.3%. Other Our Other segment includes AdminaStar Federal, a subsidiary that administers Medicare programs in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and Ohio; elimination of intersegment revenue and expenses; corporate expenses not allocated to operating segments; and Anthem Alliance. Anthem Alliance was a subsidiary that provided the health care benefits and administration in nine states for active and retired military employees and their 58 Table of Contents dependents under the Department of Defense’s TRICARE program for military families until our TRICARE business was sold on May 31, 2001. Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 are as follows: Years Ended December 31 $ Change % Change 2001 2000 ($ in Millions) Operating Revenue $ 189.5 $ 206.4 $ (16.9 ) (8 )% Operating Loss $ (23.8 ) $ (34.9 ) $ 11.1 32 % Operating revenue decreased $16.9 million, or 8%, to $189.5 million in 2001. Excluding intersegment operating revenue eliminations of $214.0 million in 2001 and $151.7 million in 2000, operating revenue increased $45.4 million, or 13%, primarily due to an increase in premiums resulting from the additional risk assumed as of January 1, 2001, by our TRICARE operations before its sale on May 31, 2001. Certain corporate expenses are not allocated to our business segments. These unallocated expenses accounted for $33.0 million in 2001 and $39.9 million in 2000, and primarily included such items as unallocated incentive compensation associated with better than expected performance. Excluding unallocated corporate expenses, operating gain was $9.2 million in 2001 versus $5.0 million in 2000. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this Management’s Discussion and Analysis. We consider some of our most important accounting policies that require estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for unpaid life, accident and health claims, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, our investment portfolio and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our significant accounting policies are also summarized in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Liability for Unpaid Life, Accident and Health Claims The most significant accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for unpaid life, accident and health claims. This liability was $1,826.0 million and represented 26% of our total consolidated liabilities at December 31, 2002. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for pending claims and claims that are incurred but not reported. Pending claims are those received by us, but not yet processed through our systems. We determine the amount of this liability for each of our business segments by following a detailed process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. We also look back to assess how our prior periods’ estimates developed. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period claims expense. Since the average life of most claims is just a few months, current medical cost trends and utilization patterns are very important in our estimate of claims liabilities. For information regarding our cost trends, refer to the discussion of benefit expenses included within this Management’s Discussion and Analysis. In addition to the pending claims and incurred but not reported claims, the liability for unpaid life, accident and health claims includes reserves for premium deficiency losses. The premium deficiency losses are recognized when it is probable that expected claims and loss adjustment expenses will exceed future premiums on existing health and other insurance contracts without consideration of investment income. For purposes of premium deficiency losses, contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. 59 Table of Contents Management constantly reviews its assumptions regarding our claims liabilities, and makes adjustments to claims expense recorded, if necessary, in the period it deems appropriate. If it is determined that management’s assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claims liabilities occur each quarter and are sometimes significant as compared to the total expense recorded in that quarter. Note 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K provides historical information regarding the accrual and payment of our unpaid claims liability. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 8, the line labeled “incurred related to prior years” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “incurred related to prior years” claims may be offset as we re-establish the “incurred related to current year”. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims within a level of confidence required to meet actuarial standards. Thus, only when the release of a prior year reserve is not offset with the same level of conservatism in estimating the current year reserve will the redundancy reduce benefit expense. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is other than our normal release being experienced. An example of a redundancy release is discussed in the “Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001” included elsewhere in this Management Discussion and Analysis. We believe we have consistently applied this methodology in determining our best estimate for unpaid claims liability each year. This is demonstrated by comparing prior year redundancies to total incurred claims recorded in each past year. This metric was 1.3% in 2000, 1.5% in 2001 and 1.9% at the end of 2002. When this metric remains constant or increases, it is an indication of the consistency of our reserving procedures and policies. Additional review of Note 8 indicates that we are paying claims faster. The percentage of claims paid in the same year as they were incurred increased to 84.3% in 2002 compared with 83.1% in 2001 and 81.3% in 2000. This is primarily attributable to our implementation of new systems and improved electronic connectivity with our networks. As a result of our improved connectivity we are able to adjudicate and pay claims more swiftly. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This standard requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. At each quarterly financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the key elements that follow: • the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset; • the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim; • the forecasted future taxable income and therefore likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and • any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences. During 2002, based on our quarterly assessments of the valuation allowance it was determined that the only items that require a valuation allowance are those that relate to specific deferred tax temporary differences and 60 Table of Contents not those that relate to the anticipation of future taxable income. This determination was due to the levels of taxable income reported on our 2001 tax return, income generated during 2002 and taxable income expected in future periods. As a result of this determination, during 2002, we reduced our valuation allowance. The net decrease in the valuation allowance for 2002 was $112.4 million. During 2002, $18.0 million of the change in the valuation allowance was recorded as a reduction to goodwill. This postacquisition adjustment resulted from recognition of deferred tax assets previously determined to be unrealizable. Because of uncertainties including industry-wide issues regarding both the timing and the amount of deductions, we recorded a $57.2 million deferred tax liability. We also recorded a reduction to income tax expense of $37.2 million. This reduction contributed to a reduced effective tax rate of 31.6%. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for or are required to pay more than reserved, our future effective tax rate and net income in any given period could be materially impacted. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service continues its examination of two of our five open tax years. For additional information, see Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets On January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and Statement of Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FAS 141 requires business combinations completed after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. It also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. On July 31, 2002, we completed our purchase of 100% of the outstanding stock of Trigon. In accordance with FAS 141, we allocated the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including identifiable intangible assets. The allocation resulted in $2,166.6 million of estimated non-tax deductible goodwill and $1,172.7 million of acquired intangible assets. Following this acquisition, our consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2002 was $2,484.9 million and intangible assets were $1,274.6 million. The sum of goodwill and intangible assets represented 31% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2002. Under FAS 142, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually. We completed our transitional impairment test of existing goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) during the second quarter of 2002. In addition, we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) during the fourth quarter of 2002. Based upon these tests we have not incurred any impairment losses related to any intangible assets. While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, the annual impairment testing required under FAS 142 requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our goodwill and intangibles. Such assumptions include the present value discount factor used to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, which is ultimately used to identify potential goodwill impairment. Such estimated fair values might produce significantly different results if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. Because of the amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet, the impairment analysis is significant. If we are unable to support a fair value estimate in future annual impairment tests, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income. For additional information, see Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. 61 Table of Contents Investments Total investment securities were $5,948.1 million at December 31, 2002 and represented 48% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2002. Our fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as “available-for-sale” securities and are reported at fair value. We have determined that all investments in our portfolio are available to support current operations, and accordingly, have classified such securities as current assets. Investment income is recorded when earned, and realized gains or losses, determined by specific identification of investments sold, are included in income when sold. We evaluate our investment securities on a quarterly basis, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. If any declines are determined to be other than temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made. The current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment. The same influences tend to increase the risk of potentially impaired assets. Management believes it has adequately reviewed for impairment and that its investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change management’s judgment regarding impairment. This could result in realized losses relating to other than temporary declines being charged against future income. Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. Our primary objective is the preservation of the asset base and maximization of portfolio income given an acceptable level of risk. We manage the market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and percentage amount limits of investments in individual issuers. If we are unable to effectively manage these risks, it could have an impact on our future earnings and financial position. The unrealized losses of $7.8 million on our fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2002 were substantially related to interest rate changes. We expect the scheduled principal and interest payments will be realized. Our equity securities are comprised of indexed mutual funds and the unrealized losses of $38.6 million at December 31, 2002 were a result of the current market fluctuations and are deemed to be temporary. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. Retirement Benefits Pension Benefits We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our employees, and account for these plans in accordance with FAS 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by FAS 87, we use a calculated value of plan assets (described below). Further, the effects on our computation of pension expense of the performance of the pension plans’ assets and changes in pension liabilities are amortized over future periods. The most important factor in determining our pension expense is the expected return on plan assets. During 2002, we lowered our expected rate of return on plan assets to 8.50% (from 9.00% for 2002 expense recognition). We believe our assumption of future returns of 8.50% is reasonable. This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years. This produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 62 Table of Contents over three years. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The plan assets have earned a rate of return substantially less than 8.50% over the last two years. Should this trend continue, future pension expense would likely increase. At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. Our discount rate is developed using a benchmark rate of the Moody’s Aa Corporate Bonds index at our measurement date (September 30, 2002). At our measurement date, we selected a discount rate of 6.75%. Changes in the discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension expense, and the net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized in accordance with FAS 87. At December 31, 2002, our consolidated prepaid pension asset was $146.2 million, an increase from $60.5 million at December 31, 2001. The increase was primarily due to our funding of the Anthem Cash Balance Pension Plan in the amount of $136.9 million during the third quarter of 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized consolidated pretax pension expense of $14.3 million, a slight increase from $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Other Postretirement Benefits We provide most employees certain life, medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree health plan. Our discount rate is developed using a benchmark rate of the Moody’s Aa Corporate Bonds index at our measurement date (September 30, 2002). At our measurement date, we selected a discount rate of 6.75%. The health care cost trend rate used in measuring the other benefit obligations is generally 10% in 2002, decreasing 1% per year to 5% in 2007. New Accounting Pronouncements During 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations and Statement of Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. See “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” above and for additional information regarding the pro forma effect of adopting these statements, see Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. There were no other new accounting pronouncements issued during 2002 that had a material impact on our financial position or operating results. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Introduction Our cash receipts consist primarily of premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue and proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities. Cash disbursements result mainly from benefit expenses, administrative expenses, taxes, purchase of investment securities and interest expense. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these expenses. As such, any future decline in our profitability would likely have some negative impact on our liquidity. 63 Table of Contents We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy. A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities, to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are available for sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Excess capital is paid in the form of dividends by subsidiaries to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, annually as permitted by applicable regulations. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. We have access to $1.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, which allow us to maintain further operating and financial flexibility. Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001 During 2002, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $991.1 million, an increase of $336.5 million, or 51%, over 2001. The increase is a reflection of our improved net income. Higher non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, as well as favorable changes in our operating assets and liabilities complemented this increased net income to generate improved cash flow from operations. Net cash flow used in investing activities was $1,411.9 million in 2002, compared to $498.1 million in 2001, an increase of $913.8 million. The table below outlines where the changes between the two years occurred: Increase in purchases of subsidiaries $ (785.5 ) Decrease in proceeds from sales of subsidiaries (44.1 ) Increase in net purchases of investments (40.9 ) Increase in net purchases and proceeds from sale of property and equipment (43.3 ) Total increase in cash used in investing activities $ (913.8 ) The increase in subsidiary purchases resulted primarily from the Trigon acquisition in 2002, for which we paid $772.4 million in net cash. Cash acquired on Trigon’s balance sheet was $362.2 million, which partially offset $1,134.6 million used for the purchase price and transaction costs. The net decline in cash received from divestitures between the two years reflects proceeds from the sale of TRICARE in 2001, which did not occur in 2002. The purchase of investment securities increased as operating cash was moved into our investment portfolio. The increased property and equipment purchases include $24.6 million of expenditures made by Trigon following the acquisition date. The remainder of the increased property purchases resulted from investments in computer technology and software. Net cash flow provided by financing activities was $709.3 million in 2002 compared to $46.6 million in 2001. On July 31, 2002, Anthem issued $950.0 million of long-term senior unsecured notes ($150.0 million of 4.875% notes due 2005, and $800.0 million of 6.800% notes due 2012). The net proceeds of $938.5 million from the note offering were used to pay a portion of the approximately $1,134.5 million of cash consideration and expenses associated with Anthem’s acquisition of Trigon. In addition, $30.9 million of proceeds resulted from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and through the employee stock purchase program. We used $256.2 million to repurchase our common stock during 2002. The $46.6 million of cash provided by financing activities during 2001 is related to the demutualization and initial public offering, which is described below in “Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000.” 64 Table of Contents Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000 Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $654.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, and $684.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of $29.9 million, or 4%. In both 2001 and 2000, net cash flow provided by operating activities was impacted by better balance sheet management resulting from the conversion of certain operating assets, such as receivables and investments in non-strategic assets, to cash. As the continuing focus on balance sheet management began in early 2000, our cash flow provided by operating activities in 2000 was unusually high. During 2001, demutualization expenses of $27.6 million were incurred relating to our conversion to a stockholder owned company. Also during 2001, incentive compensation payments were made which had been accrued over the previous three years. Neither of these items occurred during 2000. Net cash used in investing activities was $498.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, and $761.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of $263.0 million, or 35%. The table below outlines where the changes between the two years occurred: Decrease in purchases of subsidiaries $ 81.0 Increase in proceeds from sales of subsidiaries 39.6 Decrease in net purchases of investments 146.9 Decrease in net purchases and proceeds from sale of property and equipment (4.5 ) Total decrease in cash used in investing activities $ 263.0 The decrease in purchase of subsidiaries reflects the cash used to purchase BCBS-ME in 2000, which did not occur again in 2001. The increase in proceeds from sale of subsidiaries resulted from the sale of our TRICARE operations in 2001. The decreased net purchase of investments was primarily a result of our direction to investment mangers to maintain greater liquidity at December 31, 2001 as compared to December 31, 2000. The slight decline in the purchase of property and equipment reflects the sale of our TRICARE operations, which had minimum property additions in 2001 as compared to the prior year, and higher levels of purchases for furniture and capitalized software in 2000. Net cash provided by financing activities was $46.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, and $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of $28.9 million, or 38%. The $46.6 million of cash provided by financing activities in 2001 included net proceeds received from our initial public offering, after making payments to eligible statutory members. On November 2, 2001, Anthem Insurance Companies, Inc. (“Anthem Insurance”) converted from a mutual insurance company to a stock insurance company in a process known as a demutualization. Effective with the demutualization, Anthem, Inc. (“Anthem”) completed an initial public offering of 55.2 million shares of common stock at an initial public offering price of $36.00 per share. The shares issued in the initial public offering are in addition to 48.1 million shares of common stock (which will ultimately vary slightly as all distribution issues are finalized) distributed to eligible statutory members in the demutualization. Concurrent with our initial public offering of common stock, we issued 4.6 million 6.00% Equity Security Units at $50.00 per unit. After an underwriting discount and other offering expenses, net proceeds from our common stock offering were approximately $1,890.4 million (excluding demutualization expenses of $27.6 million). After underwriting discount and expenses, net proceeds from our Units offering were approximately $219.8 million. In December 2001, proceeds from our common stock and Units offerings in the amount of $2,063.6 million were used to fund payments to eligible statutory members of Anthem Insurance who received cash instead of common stock in our demutualization. Our 2000 financing activities of $75.5 million consisted of $295.9 million net proceeds received from the issuance of $300.0 million of surplus notes on a discounted basis, less $220.4 million repayment of bank debt. 65 Table of Contents Financial Condition We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash and investments of $6.6 billion at December 31, 2002. Total cash and investments increased by $2.2 billion since December 31, 2001, primarily resulting from our acquisition of Trigon and strong cash flows from operations, partially offset by cash used for stock repurchases. Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. During 2002, Anthem received $702.0 million of dividends from its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2002, Anthem held approximately $200.0 million of our $6.6 billion of cash and investments. This is available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, share and debt repurchases and interest payments. Our consolidated debt-to-total-capital ratio (calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt plus shareholders’ equity) was 24.7% as of December 31, 2002 and 28.4% as of December 31, 2001. We expect to maintain our debt-to-total-capital ratio at 25% or less. At these levels, we believe our cost of capital and return on shareholders’ equity is optimized, while maintaining a sufficient level of leverage and liquidity. Our senior debt is rated “BBB+” by Standard & Poor’s, “A-” by Fitch, Inc., “Baa2” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “a-” by AM Best Company, Inc. Consistent with our intention of maintaining our senior debt investment grade ratings, we intend to maintain our debt-to-total-capital ratio at 25% or less. A significant downgrade in our debt could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs. Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity On July 2, 2002, Anthem Insurance amended and restated its revolving lines of credit with its lender group to make Anthem the borrower and to increase the available borrowings to $1.0 billion. Under one facility, which expires November 5, 2006, Anthem may borrow up to $400.0 million. Under the other facility, which expires July 1, 2003, Anthem may borrow up to $600.0 million. Any amounts outstanding under this facility at July 1, 2003 (except amounts which bear interest rates determined by a competitive bidding process) convert to a one-year term loan at Anthem’s option. Anthem’s ability to borrow under these credit facilities is subject to compliance with certain covenants. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2002. Anthem Insurance’s two previous revolving credit facilities totaling $800.0 million were terminated on July 2, 2002, as well as the two credit agreements entered into in February 2002, allowing for $135.0 million of additional borrowings. In addition to the revolving credit facilities, at December 31, 2001, Anthem Insurance had a commercial paper program which was discontinued as of July 2, 2002. No amounts were outstanding under the current or prior facilities as of December 31, 2002 or 2001. On December 18, 2002, Anthem filed a shelf registration with the SEC to register any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings up to an aggregate amount of $1.0 billion. Specific information regarding terms of the offering and the securities being offered will be provided at the time of the offering. Proceeds from any offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt, investments in our subsidiaries or the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion. On January 27, 2003, the Board of Directors authorized management to establish a $1,000.0 commercial paper program. Proceeds from any future issuance of commercial paper may be used for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of debt and common stock of Anthem. As discussed above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we are expecting approximately $425.0 million of dividends to be paid to Anthem during 2003. 66 Table of Contents In 2002, our board of directors authorized, a $400.0 million stock repurchase program, which ended February 2003. Repurchases could be made from time to time at prevailing prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. During 2002, we repurchased 4.1 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $256.2 million. In 2003, the board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to $500.0 million of stock under a new program that will expire in February 2005. Under the new program, repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. Anthem Southeast has started a four-year, estimated $84.0 million building construction project to expand its regional offices in Richmond, Virginia. The expansion plan includes construction of a four-story, 308,000-square-foot building to house the operations center and major renovation to Trigon’s existing headquarter building. Construction for the new building began in 2001, with completion scheduled for mid-2003. Renovations of the current facility will begin once the new building is completed with a scheduled completion date in 2005. The project will be funded using internal cash and investments. There are currently no other commitments for major capital expenditures to support existing business. Through December 31, 2002, we have capitalized $36.1 million related to the ongoing construction. In addition, we have recorded capitalized interest of $0.8 million, bringing the total amount included in work-in-progress as of December 31, 2002 to $36.9 million. We currently have an acquisition pending with BCBS-KS for a purchase price of $190.0 million. See the “Significant Transactions” section of this discussion for additional details. For additional information on our future debt maturities and lease commitments, see Notes 5 and 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. Risk-Based Capital Our regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies largely based on the NAIC’s RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under this Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our risk-based capital as of December 31, 2002, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, was in excess of all mandatory RBC thresholds. In addition to exceeding the RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements of a licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on Anthem’s financial positions as of December 31, 2002. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objective is preserving the asset base, maximizing investment income, and achieving an appropriate return commensurate with an acceptable level of risk. Our portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: interest rate risk, credit risk, and market valuation risk for equity holdings. The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit downgrade to an individual fixed income security and the potential loss attributable to that downgrade. We manage this risk through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. Since we are advised of circumstances surrounding credit rating downgrades, we are able to promptly avoid or minimize exposure to losses by selling the subject security. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed income securities, with an average credit rating of approximately AA. Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed rate securities, due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio consists exclusively of U.S. dollar-denominated assets, invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds and mortgage-related securities, all of which represent an exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. We manage interest rate risk by maintaining a duration commensurate with our insurance liabilities and shareholders’ equity. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value. Our investment policy prohibits use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Our portfolio consists of corporate securities (approximately 40% of the total fixed income portfolio at December 31, 2002) which are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed income portfolio. This risk is managed through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of the corporate fixed income portfolio of approximately AA. Our equity portfolio is exposed to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systematic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in index mutual funds that replicate the risk and performance of the S&P 500 and S&P 400 indices, resulting in a diversified equity portfolio. All of our current investments are classified as available-for-sale. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 97% of these were fixed maturity securities. Market risk is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed income portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $178.6 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $214.2 million increase in fair value. As of December 31, 2002, no portion of our fixed income portfolio was invested in non-US dollar denominated investments. We also maintain a diverse portfolio of large capitalization equity securities. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $15.1 million. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $15.1 million. No portion of our equity portfolio was invested in non-US dollar denominated investments as of December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, we held no derivative financial or commodity-based instruments. 68 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:53:14.712583

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein)References to the terms “we”, “our” or “us” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, refer to WellPoint, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries.This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, included in this Form 10-K.OverviewOn May 20, 2013, we announced certain organizational and executive leadership changes to align with how our new Chief Executive Officer is managing our operations. Beginning with the three months ended June 30, 2013, our organizational structure is comprised of three reportable segments: Commercial and Specialty Business; Government Business; and Other. Prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the new segment reporting structure.Our Commercial and Specialty Business segment includes our Local Group, National Accounts, Individual and Specialty businesses. Business units in the Commercial and Specialty Business segment offer fully-insured products; provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management, disease management, wellness programs and other administrative services; and provide an array of specialty and other insurance products and services such as behavioral health benefit services, dental, vision, life and disability insurance benefits, radiology benefit management, analytics-driven personal health care guidance and long-term care insurance. Our Government Business segment includes our Medicare and Medicaid businesses, National Government Services, or NGS, and services provided to the Federal Government in connection with the Federal Employee Program, or FEP. Our Medicare business includes services such as Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and Medicare Supplement, while our Medicaid business includes our managed care alternatives through publicly funded health care programs, including Medicaid, state Children’s Health Insurance Programs, or CHIP, and Medicaid expansion programs. NGS acts as a Medicare contractor in several regions across the nation.Our Other segment includes other businesses that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, guidance, as well as corporate expenses not allocated to the other reportable segments.In preparation for the coming changes to the health care system and to focus on our core growth opportunities across our Commercial and Specialty Business and Government Business segments, we entered into a definitive agreement in December 2013 to sell our 1-800 CONTACTS, Inc., or 1-800 CONTACTS, business to the private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. Concurrently, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Luxottica Group to sell our glasses.com related assets. The divestitures were completed on January 31, 2014. The operating results for 1-800 CONTACTS are reported as discontinued operations as a result of the pending divestiture at December 31, 2013. These results were previously reported in the Commercial and Specialty Business segment. Additionally, the assets and liabilities of 1-800-CONTACTS are reported as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets included in this Form 10-K. Unless otherwise specified, all financial information, other than cash flows, disclosed in this MD&A is from continuing operations. In accordance with FASB guidance, we have elected to not separately disclose net cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities and the net effect of those cash flows on cash and cash equivalents for discontinued operations during the periods presented. For additional information regarding these transactions, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,"" to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, included in this Form 10-K.Our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue comes from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. Administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, or where the fee is based on either processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized. Additionally, we earn administrative fee revenues from our Medicare -42-processing business and from other health-related businesses including disease management programs. Other revenue includes miscellaneous income other than premium revenue and administrative fees.Our benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. While we offer a diversified mix of managed care products and services through our managed care plans, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products and services. Our managed care plans include: preferred provider organizations, or PPOs; health maintenance organizations, or HMOs; point-of-service plans, or POS plans; traditional indemnity plans and other hybrid plans, including consumer-driven health plans, or CDHPs; and hospital only and limited benefit products. We classify certain claims-related costs as benefit expense to reflect costs incurred for our members’ traditional medical care, as well as those expenses which improve our members’ health and medical outcomes. These claims-related costs may be comprised of expenses incurred for: (i) medical management, including case and utilization management; (ii) health and wellness, including disease management services for such conditions as diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, congestive heart failure and asthma management and wellness initiatives like weight-loss programs and smoking cessation treatments; and (iii) clinical health policy. These types of claims-related costs are designed to ultimately lower our members’ cost of care. Our selling expense consists of external broker commission expenses, and generally varies with premium or membership volume. Our general and administrative expense consists of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Other costs are variable or discretionary in nature. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium, but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels, and thus associated compensation expense. Examples of discretionary costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity.Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management and health and wellness programs. Several economic factors related to health care costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating health care costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers and any regulatory or market driven restrictions on our ability to obtain adequate premium rates to offset overall inflation in health care costs, including increases in unit costs and utilization resulting from the aging of the population and other demographics, as well as advances in medical technology, may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material impact on our results of operations.Our future results of operations will also be impacted by certain external forces and resulting changes in our business model and strategy. In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed and the President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, as well as the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, Health Care Reform, which represents significant changes to the U.S. health care system. The legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage over time by increasing the eligibility thresholds for state Medicaid programs and providing certain other individuals and small businesses with tax credits to subsidize a portion of the cost of health insurance coverage. As a result of the complexity of the law, its impacts on health care in the United States and the continuing modification and interpretation of Health Care Reform’s rules, we continue to analyze the impact and refine our estimates of the ultimate impact of Health Care Reform on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. A list of certain material changes resulting from Health Care Reform include:•Requirements to modify our products to cover essential health benefits and comply with other defined criteria;•Requirement to cancel existing products and enroll new and renewing members in the new ACA-compliant “metal” -43-products (bronze, silver, gold and platinum);•Introduction of exchanges, subsidies and mandates to require and allow previously uninsured customers to enter the market; and•Significant new taxes and fees which will be paid by health insurers, and which may or may not be passed through to customers.The above changes resulting from Health Care Reform will provide growth opportunities for health insurers, but also introduce new risks and uncertainties, and require changes in the way our products are designed, underwritten, priced, distributed and administered.Pricing in our Commercial and Specialty Business segment, including our individual and small group lines of business, remains highly competitive and we strive to price our health care benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends. We believe our pricing strategy, based on predictive modeling, proprietary research and data-driven processes, as well as our overall investments for Health Care Reform, have positioned us to benefit from the potential growth opportunities available in fully-insured commercial products as a result of Health Care Reform. While the ultimate level of exchange enrollment cannot be predicted, we have experienced a greater number of policy applications for new members through the exchanges than expected, including geographical regions with lower price competition. The exchanges may increase the risk that our products will be selected by individuals who have a higher risk profile or utilization rate than the pool of participants we anticipated when we established the pricing for these exchange products. However, early indications of the risk characteristics of new applicants appear to be tracking closely to the risk levels utilized in the development of our pricing assumptions. Although it is not yet clear whether our products sold on the exchanges will be more or less profitable products, we believe that our pricing strategy, brand name and network quality will provide a strong foundation for commercial risk membership growth opportunities in the future. In our individual markets we offer bronze, silver and gold products, both on and off the exchanges, in the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. Additionally, we offer platinum products, both on and off the exchanges, in the states of California and New York.In our small group markets, we offer bronze, silver and gold products, both on and off the exchanges, in the states of Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio and Virginia and we offer bronze, silver and gold products, off the exchanges, in the states of California, New York and Wisconsin. Additionally, we offer platinum products, off the exchanges, in the states of California, Connecticut, Georgia, Maine and Virginia.The legislation also imposes new regulations on the health insurance sector, including, but not limited to, guaranteed coverage requirements; prohibitions on some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to our members; increased restrictions on rescinding coverage; establishment of minimum medical loss ratio, or MLR, requirements; a requirement to cover preventive services on a first dollar basis; the establishment of state insurance exchanges and essential benefit packages; and greater limitations on how we price certain of our products. The legislation also reduces the reimbursement levels for health plans participating in the Medicare Advantage program over time.As a result of Health Care Reform, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, issued MLR regulations that require us to meet minimum MLR thresholds for large group, small group and individual lines of business. For purposes of determining MLR rebates, HHS has defined the types of costs that should be included in the MLR rebate calculation. However, certain components of the MLR calculation as defined by HHS cannot be classified consistently under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. While considered benefit expense or a reduction of premium revenue by HHS, certain of these costs are classified as other types of expense, such as income tax expense or selling, general and administrative expense, in our GAAP basis financial statements. Accordingly, the benefit expense ratio determined using our consolidated GAAP operating results is not comparable to the MLR calculated under HHS regulations. Beginning with rebates paid in 2014 for the 2013 benefit year, MLR rebates will be based on a three year average. This calculation will determine an average MLR for each market segment within each state for the previous three calendar years. Additionally, insurers will be able to adjust experience to account for prior MLR rebates refunded to groups or individuals. Once the three year average MLR is calculated and compared to the minimum MLR threshold, the rebate percentage will be applied to current year premiums as defined by Health Care Reform. Beginning with MLR rebates paid in 2015 for the 2014 -44-benefit year, insurers will adjust for the risk adjustment, reinsurance, and risk corridor premium stabilization programs of Health Care Reform.Health Care Reform also imposes a separate minimum MLR threshold of 85% for Medicare Advantage plans beginning in 2014. Medicare Advantage plans that do not meet this threshold will have to pay a minimum MLR rebate. If a plan’s MLR is below 85% for three consecutive years beginning with 2014, enrollment will be restricted. A Medicare Advantage plan contract will be terminated if the plan's MLR is below 85% for five consecutive years. These and other provisions of Health Care Reform are likely to have significant effects on our future operations, which, in turn, could impact the value of our business model and results of operations, including potential impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets. We will continue to evaluate the impact of Health Care Reform as key aspects go into effect and additional guidance is made available. For additional discussion regarding Health Care Reform, see Part I, Item 1 “Business—Regulation” and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.Finally, federal and state regulatory agencies may further restrict our ability to obtain new product approvals, implement changes in premium rates or impose additional restrictions, under new or existing laws that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.We are also subject to regulations that may result in assessments under state insurance guarantee association laws. The National Organization of Life & Health Insurance Guaranty Associations, or NOLHGA, is a voluntary organization consisting of the state life and health insurance guaranty associations located throughout the U.S. State life and health insurance guaranty associations, working together with NOLHGA, provide a safety net for their state’s policyholders, ensuring that they continue to receive coverage even if their insurer is declared insolvent. We are aware that the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner, or Insurance Commissioner, has placed Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary American Network Insurance Company, or collectively Penn Treaty, in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency. The state court denied the Insurance Commissioner’s petition for the liquidation of Penn Treaty and ordered the Insurance Commissioner to file an updated plan of rehabilitation, which proposed plan was filed on April 30, 2013. The state court has ordered a hearing on the proposed plan for which a date has not yet been set. The Insurance Commissioner has filed a Notice of Appeal asking the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to reverse the order denying the liquidation petition. The Supreme Court has probable jurisdiction over the appeal and issued a schedule for filing briefs. In the event rehabilitation of Penn Treaty is unsuccessful and Penn Treaty is declared insolvent and placed in liquidation, we and other insurers may be required to pay a portion of their policyholder claims through state guaranty association assessments in future periods. Given the uncertainty around whether Penn Treaty will ultimately be declared insolvent and, if so, the amount of the insolvency, the amount and timing of any associated future guaranty fund assessments and the availability and amount of any potential premium tax and other offsets, we currently cannot estimate our net exposure, if any, to this potential insolvency. We will continue to monitor the situation and may record a liability and expense in future reporting periods, which could be material to our cash flows and results of operations.In addition to external forces discussed in the preceding paragraphs, our results of operations are impacted by levels and mix of membership. In recent years, we experienced membership declines due to unfavorable economic conditions driving increased unemployment. In addition, we believe the self-insured portion of our group membership base will continue to increase as a percentage of total group membership. Further, our mix of membership may include more individuals with a higher acuity level obtaining coverage through our products available on the exchanges, which may not be appropriately adjusted for in our premium rates. These membership trends could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Also see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.Executive SummaryWe are one of the largest health benefits companies in terms of medical membership in the United States, serving 35.7 medical members through our affiliated health plans and a total of 67.8 individuals through all subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or BCBS, licensee for: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (as BCBS in 10 New York City metropolitan and surrounding counties, and as Blue Cross or BCBS in selected upstate counties only), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas we do -45-business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, or Empire Blue Cross (in our New York service areas). We also conduct business through our AMERIGROUP Corporation, or Amerigroup, subsidiary in Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. Amerigroup also provided services in the state of Ohio through June 30, 2013 and in the state of New Mexico through December 31, 2013. We also serve customers throughout the country as HealthLink, UniCare and in certain Arizona, California, Nevada, New York and Virginia markets through our CareMore Health Group, Inc., or CareMore, subsidiary. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states through our subsidiaries. We also sold contact lenses, eyeglasses and other ocular products through our 1-800 CONTACTS business, which was divested on January 31, 2014.Operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $70,191.4, an increase of $9,677.4, or 16.0%, from the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily reflecting higher premium revenue in our Government Business segment, partially offset by lower premium revenue in our Commercial and Specialty Business segment. The higher premium revenue in our Government Business segment primarily resulted from the acquisition of Amerigroup in December 2012, growth in our FEP business resulting from both premium rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends and increases in membership as well as increased membership in our CareMore subsidiary. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues in our non-CareMore Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D businesses primarily due to membership losses as a result of our product repositioning strategy toward HMO product offerings. The premium revenue decrease in our Commercial and Specialty Business segment was driven primarily by fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business resulting from strategic product portfolio changes in certain states, competitive pressure in certain markets and, we believe, affordability challenges affecting healthcare consumers in general. This decrease was partially offset by premium rate increases in our Local Group, Individual and National Accounts businesses designed to cover overall cost trends as well as premium rate and membership increases in our Specialty businesses, primarily related to our dental and vision products, and increased administrative fees resulting from pricing increases for self-funded members in our Commercial businesses.Net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $2,489.7, a decrease of $165.8, or 6.2%, from the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in net income was primarily driven by the loss on disposal of our 1-800 CONTACTS business, costs incurred in preparation for the implementation of Health Care Reform effective in 2014, realized losses on extinguishment of debt, an increase in interest expense resulting from higher outstanding debt balances associated with our acquisition of Amerigroup and lower operating results in our Commercial and Specialty Business segment. These decreases were partially offset by higher operating results in our Government Business segment, primarily from Amerigroup.Our diluted earnings per share, or EPS, for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $8.20, an increase of $0.02, or 0.2%, from the year ended December 31, 2012. Our diluted EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $8.67, an increase of $0.50, or 6.1%, from the year ended December 31, 2012. Our diluted shares for the year ended December 31, 2013 were 303.8 million, a decrease of 21.0 million, or 6.5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in diluted EPS resulted primarily from the lower number of shares outstanding in 2013 due to share buyback activity under our share repurchase program partially offset by the decrease in net income. Our results of operations discussed throughout this MD&A are determined in accordance with GAAP. We also calculate adjusted net income, adjusted EPS and operating gain, which are non-GAAP measures, to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results and comparing them among periods. Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS exclude realized gains and losses on investments, other-than-temporary losses on investments recognized in income, impairment of other intangible assets and certain other items, if applicable, that we do not consider a part of our core operating results. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, selling, general and administrative expense. We use these measures as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and forecasting future operating periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income before income tax expense, net income or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional details on operating gain, see our “Reportable Segments Results of Operations” discussion included in this MD&A.-46-The table below reconciles net income and diluted EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP to adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.

Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $2,744.6, or 1.0 times net income. The increase in operating cash flow from 2012 of $307.7 was driven primarily by an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items, primarily due to the loss on disposal of discontinued operations, changes in amortization expense and realized losses on extinguishment of debt. The increase was further attributable to lower payments for litigation related matters, incentive compensation and minimum MLR rebates; and a net increase in the collection of income tax refunds in 2013.We intend to expand through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and efficient use of capital in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. While we have achieved strong growth as a result of strategic mergers and acquisitions, we have also achieved organic growth in our existing markets over time by providing excellent service, offering competitively priced products, access to high quality provider networks and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks.-47-Significant TransactionsThe more significant transactions that have occurred over the last three years that have impacted or will impact our capital structure or that have or will influence how we conduct our business operations include:•Use of Capital—Board of Directors declaration of dividends on common stock (2013, 2012 and 2011) and a 16.7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.4375 per share (2014); authorization for repurchases of our common stock (2013 and prior); and debt repurchases and new debt issuance (2013 and prior);•Acquisition of Amerigroup and the related debt issuance (2012);•Acquisition of 1-800 CONTACTS (2012) and subsequent divestiture (2014); and •Acquisition of CareMore (2011).For additional information regarding these transactions, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” Note 13, ""Debt"" and Note 15, “Capital Stock,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, included in this Form 10-K.MembershipOur medical membership includes seven different customer types: Local Group, Individual, National Accounts, BlueCard®, Medicare, Medicaid and FEP. BCBS-branded business generally refers to members in our service areas licensed by the BCBSA. Non-BCBS-branded business refers to Amerigroup and CareMore members as well as Healthlink and UniCare members predominantly outside of our BCBSA service areas.•Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. In addition, Local Group includes UniCare local group members. These groups are generally sold through brokers or consultants working with industry specialists from our in-house sales force. Local Group insurance premiums may be based on claims incurred by the group or sold on a self-insured basis. The customer’s buying decision is typically based upon the size and breadth of our networks, customer service, the quality of our medical management services, the administrative cost included in our quoted price, our financial stability, reputation and our ability to effectively service large complex accounts. Local Group accounted for 41.2%, 40.5% and 44.4% of our medical members at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.•Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 (including UniCare) and their covered dependents. Individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, retail partnerships, our in-house sales force or via the Internet. Individual business is sold on a fully-insured basis. We offer on-exchange products through state or federally facilitated marketplaces and off-exchange products. Federal premium subsidies are available only for certain on-exchange individual products. Individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network, and the efficiency of administration. Account turnover is generally higher with Individual as compared to Local Group. Individual business accounted for 4.9%, 5.1% and 5.4% of our medical members at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.•National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in a WellPoint service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker relationships. Service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. National Accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. We have an advantage when competing for very large National Accounts due to the size and breadth of our networks and our ability to access the national provider networks of BCBS companies at their competitive local market rates. National Accounts represented 19.0%, 19.4% and 21.6% of our medical members at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.•BlueCard® host customers represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by WellPoint who receive health care services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard® membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard® program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-WellPoint controlled BCBSA licensee (i.e., the “home plan”). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard® members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard® members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the -48-average number of BlueCard® claims received per month. BlueCard® host membership accounted for 14.2%, 13.9% and 14.4% of our medical members at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.•Medicare customers are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a managed care alternative for the Medicare program, who have purchased Medicare Supplement benefit coverage, some disabled under 65, or all ages with End Stage Renal Disease. Medicare Supplement policies are sold to Medicare recipients as supplements to the benefits they receive from the Medicare program. Rates are filed with and in some cases approved by state insurance departments. Most of the premium for Medicare Advantage is paid directly by the Federal government on behalf of the participant who may also be charged a small premium. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. Medicare business accounted for 4.1%, 4.4% and 4.3% of our medical members at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.•Medicaid membership represents eligible members who receive health care benefits through publicly funded health care programs, including Medicaid, CHIP and Medicaid expansion programs. Total Medicaid program business accounted for 12.3%, 12.5% and 5.5% of our medical members at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.•FEP members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. FEP business accounted for 4.3%, 4.2% and 4.4% of our medical members at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two principal funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some self-funded customers choose to purchase stop-loss coverage to limit their retained risk.-49-The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Also included below is other membership by product. The medical membership and other membership presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

Life and disability products are generally offered as part of commercial medical fully-insured membership sales.Dental membership decreased 206, or 4.1%, primarily due to the lapse of a large dental contract, partially offset by the launch of new dental products in 2012.Dental administration membership decreased 59, or 1.4%, primarily due to the lapse of a large contract pursuant to which we provided dental administrative services.Vision membership increased 736, or 19.5%, primarily due to strong sales and positive in-group change in our National Accounts, Local Group and Medicare businesses.Medicare Advantage Part D membership increased 99, or 15.6%, primarily due to strong sales during the open enrollment period resulting from our geographic expansion into several new counties and members acquired with the -52-acquisition of Amerigroup, partially offset by our withdrawal of the California Regional PPO Medicare Advantage product.Medicare Part D standalone membership decreased 93, or 13.9%, primarily due to competitive pressure in certain markets.Retail vision customers increased 3,130 due to our acquisition of 1-800 CONTACTS.Cost of CareThe following discussion summarizes our aggregate underlying cost of care trends for the year ended December 31, 2013 for our Local Group fully-insured business only.Our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing the year-over-year change in average per member per month claim costs, including member co-payments and deductibles. While our cost of care trend varies by geographic location, based on underlying medical cost trends, we estimate that our aggregate cost of care trend was approximately 6.0% for the full year of 2013. We anticipate that medical cost trends will increase by approximately 50 basis points in 2014.Overall, our medical cost trend is driven by unit cost. Inpatient hospital trend is in the mid-to-high single digit range and is 80% cost driven and 20% utilization driven. While provider rate increases are a primary driver of unit cost trends, we continually negotiate with hospitals to manage these cost trends. We remain committed to optimizing our reimbursement rates and strategies to help address the cost pressures faced by employers and consumers. Inpatient admission counts per thousand members and inpatient day counts per thousand members are both slightly higher than the prior year. The average length of stay is slightly lower than the prior year. In addition to our re-contracting efforts, a number of clinical management initiatives are in place to help mitigate the inpatient trend. Focused review efforts continue in key areas, including targeting outlier facilities for length of stay and readmission, and spinal surgery cases, among others. Additionally, we continue to refine our programs related to readmission management, focused behavioral health readmission reduction and post-discharge follow-up care.Outpatient trend is in the mid-single digit range and is 90% cost driven and 10% utilization driven. Outpatient costs are a collection of different types of expenses, such as outpatient facilities, labs, x-rays, emergency room, and occupational and physical therapy. Per visit costs are still the largest contributor to overall outpatient trend, influenced largely by price increases within certain provider contracts. Outpatient utilization (visits per thousand members) is slightly higher than the prior year. We continue to work with vendors and providers to help optimize site of service decisions, including key areas such as emergency room, lab, radiology, sleep studies, and surgery settings. As an example, we have launched a Sleep Management Program through our American Imaging Management subsidiary in west, central and north-east states. The program aligns the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea with clinical guidelines based on widely accepted medical literature, while at the same time enhancing member access to high value providers and ensuring treatment compliance for the continuing payment for equipment rental and ongoing supplies. Programs like this, along with continued expansion and optimization of our utilization management programs, are serving to moderate trend.Physician services trend is in the mid-single digit range and is unit cost driven. Increases in the physician care category are partially driven by contracting changes. We continue to collaborate with physicians to improve quality of care through pay-for-performance programs and bundled payment initiatives. Additionally, we continue to enhance our ability to detect and deter fraud and abuse, reducing waste in the system.Pharmacy trend is in the mid-single digit range and is 50% unit cost related and 50% utilization related. Continued inflation in the average wholesale price of drugs is applying upward pressure to the overall cost per prescription, as is the increasing cost of specialty drugs. The increase in cost per prescription measures continues to be mitigated by improvements in our generic usage rates and benefit plan design changes. We are continuously evaluating our drug formulary to ensure the most effective pharmaceutical therapies are available to our members.In response to cost trends, we continue to pursue contracting and plan design changes, promote and implement performance-based contracts that reward clinical outcomes and quality, and expand our radiology management, disease management and advanced care management programs. We believe we are taking a leading role in the area of payment reform as evidenced by our Enhanced Personal Health Care program (previously the Patient Centered Primary Care program). By establishing the primary care doctor as central to the coordination of a patient’s health care needs, the initiative -53-builds on the success of current patient-centered medical home programs in helping to improve patient care while lowering costs. We have instituted clinical liaisons working with participating provider offices sharing reports and cost of care data with providers as well as facilitating referrals to and from care management programs. Additionally, our value-based contracting initiative continues to underscore our commitment to partnering with providers to improve quality and lower cost.-54-Consolidated Results of OperationsOur consolidated summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 are discussed in the following section.

Premiums for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $66,119.1, $56,496.7 and $55,969.6, respectively. Premiums are included in total operating revenue presented above.5bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%.6Selling, general and administrative expense ratio represents selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total operating revenue.-55-Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Total operating revenue increased $9,677.4, or 16.0%, to $70,191.4 in 2013, resulting primarily from higher premiums and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees. The higher premiums were mainly due to increases in our Medicaid business primarily as a result of our acquisition of Amerigroup in December 2012. Rate increases in our Local Group, FEP, Individual and National businesses designed to cover overall cost trends as well as premium rate and membership increases in our Specialty businesses and increased administrative fees resulting from pricing increases for self-funded members in our Commercial businesses also contributed to the increased operating revenue. These increases were partially offset by fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business due to strategic portfolio changes in certain states, competitive pressure in certain markets and, we believe, affordability challenges affecting healthcare consumers in general. Additionally, lower revenues in our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D businesses primarily due to membership declines as a result of our product repositioning strategy toward HMO product offerings, partially offset the increased operating revenues.Net investment income decreased $27.0, or 3.9%, to $659.1 in 2013, primarily due to lower investment yields. Net realized gains on investments decreased $63.0, or 18.8%, to $271.9 in 2013, primarily due to lower net realized gains on sales of fixed maturity securities partially offset by an increase in net realized gains on sales of equity securities, a realized gain on the partial divestiture of an equity method investment and an increase in net realized gains on sales and settlements of derivative financial instruments.Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments increased $61.1, or 161.6%, to $98.9 in 2013, primarily due to the impairment of certain joint venture investments and fixed maturity securities.Benefit expense increased $8,023.5, or 16.6%, to $56,237.1 in 2013, primarily from our acquisition of Amerigroup and increased benefit costs in our Local Group, Individual and FEP businesses. These increases were partially offset by the fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group and Medicare Advantage businesses as described above.Our benefit expense ratio decreased 20.0 basis points to 85.1% in 2013, due, in part, to our product repositioning strategy in certain Medicare Advantage plans toward HMO product offerings with lower benefit costs. The decrease was further attributable to the favorable impact of declines in membership in our Local Group business in products with higher benefit costs and lower than expected medical cost trends. These improvements were partially offset by the acquisition of Amerigroup, which carries higher average benefit expense ratios than our consolidated average as well as higher than expected medical cost trends in our Individual business.Selling, general and administrative expense increased $1,272.4, or 14.7%, to $9,952.9 in 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of selling, general and administrative expense related to our Amerigroup subsidiary in 2013. The increase was further attributable to costs incurred in preparation for the implementation of Health Care Reform effective in 2014 as well as increases in incentive compensation as a result of our operating performance.Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 10.0 basis points to 14.2% in 2013, primarily due to the effect of the increase in operating revenue from Amerigroup partially offset by the increased selling general and administrative expense discussed in the preceding paragraph.Other expenses increased $248.5, or 33.4%, to $993.3 in 2013, primarily due to losses on debt extinguishment of $145.3 associated with our early redemption and repurchases of $1,100.0 aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes. On July 30, 2013, we initiated a cash tender offer and consent solicitation to purchase certain of our outstanding 5.875% Notes due 2017, 7.000% Notes due 2019, 5.950% Notes due 2034, 5.850% Notes due 2036, 6.375% Notes due 2037 and 5.800% Notes due 2040 (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”). On August 13, 2013, we repurchased $700.0 of the Tendered Notes for cash totaling $837.7. Holders who tendered their notes prior to the early tender date received the principal amounts, applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the early tender offer settlement date. Additionally, on September 5, 2013, we redeemed the $400.0 outstanding principal balance of our 6.000% senior unsecured notes due 2014, plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, for cash totaling $411.0. The increase in other expense was further attributable to increased interest expense resulting from higher outstanding debt balances associated with our acquisition of Amerigroup and the issuance on July 30, 2013 of $650.0 of 2.300% notes due 2018 and $600.0 of 5.100% notes due 2044 to fund, in part, the early redemption and repurchases discussed above.-56-Income tax expense decreased $1.4, or 0.1%, to $1,205.9 in 2013. The effective tax rates in 2013 and 2012 were 31.4% and 31.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2013 includes benefits resulting from a favorable tax election made subsequent to the Amerigroup acquisition and inclusion of Amerigroup in our state apportionment factors calculation, which produces a lower effective state tax rate. The effective tax rate in 2012 includes benefits resulting from settlement with the IRS of items related to not-for-profit conversions and corporate reorganizations prior to 2012, as well as issues related to certain of our acquired companies incurred prior to our acquisition of those companies. These favorable items in the 2012 effective tax rate were partially offset by increases due to the impact of non-tax deductible litigation settlement expenses and an increase in our state deferred tax asset valuation allowance attributable to uncertainty associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards.In December 2013, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our 1-800 CONTACTS business and an asset purchase agreement to sell our glasses.com related assets (collectively, 1-800 CONTACTS). The operating results for 1-800 CONTACTS are reported as discontinued operations as a result of the pending divestiture at December 31, 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $144.6 compared to income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $4.5 for the year ended December 31, 2012. Included in the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013, is a loss on disposal of held for sale assets, net of tax, of $164.5. The loss on disposal was calculated as the difference between the fair value, as determined by the sales agreements less costs to sell, and the carrying value of the held for sale assets at December 31, 2013. The divestitures were completed on January 31, 2014 and did not result in any material difference to the loss on disposal recognized during the year ended December 31, 2013.Our net income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 80.0 basis points to 3.5% in 2013 as compared to 2012 as a result of all factors discussed above.Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2011 Total operating revenue increased $648.8, or 1.1% to $60,514.0 in 2012, resulting primarily from higher premium revenue and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees. The higher premium revenue was due primarily to membership growth in our Medicare Advantage business, including CareMore, and growth in our Medicaid business, primarily in the California market, as well as revenue from Amerigroup’s operations during the post-acquisition period. In addition, premium rate increases in our Local Group and Individual businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and increased reimbursement in our FEP business contributed to the increased premium revenue. These increases were partially offset by fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business resulting from strategic product portfolio changes in certain states, competitive pressure in certain markets and unfavorable economic conditions. Administrative fees increased primarily as a result of pricing increases for self-funded members in our National Accounts and Local Group businesses, partially offset by membership declines in our self-funded National Accounts business.Net investment income decreased $17.6, or 2.5%, to $686.1 in 2012, primarily due to lower investment yields, partially offset by higher average cash and investment balances resulting from debt issuances in 2012, including the debt issuance related to our acquisition of Amerigroup.Net realized gains on investments increased $99.8, or 42.5%, to $334.9 in 2012, primarily due to increased gains on sales of fixed maturity securities as a result of improved market conditions. Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments decreased $55.5, or 59.5%, to $37.8 in 2012, primarily due to improved market conditions.Benefit expense increased $566.1, or 1.2%, to $48,213.6 in 2012, primarily due to increases in our Medicare and Medicaid businesses, partially offset by decreases in our Local Group business. The increase in our Medicare business was driven primarily by membership growth in our Medicare Advantage business, including CareMore, while the increase in our Medicaid business was driven by both increased benefit cost trends and membership growth, including membership acquired with the acquisition of Amerigroup. These increases were partially offset by the fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business as described above, as well as favorable prior year reserve development in 2012 compared to modest reserve strengthening in 2011.Our benefit expense ratio increased 20 basis points to 85.3% in 2012, primarily due to higher medical costs in our Medicaid business, primarily in California. The benefit expense ratio increase was partially offset by improvements in our -57-Local Group and Medicare businesses and the favorable prior year reserve development. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $244.9, or 2.9%, to $8,680.5 in 2012, primarily due to additional selling, general and administrative expense related to CareMore, acquisition and integration related expenses associated with Amerigroup and the impairment of certain software assets, partially offset by lower employee incentive compensation costs.Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio increased 20 basis points to 14.3% in 2012, primarily due to the increased selling, general and administrative expense discussed in the preceding paragraph, partially offset by increased operating revenue.Other expense increased $75.1, or 11.2%, to $744.8 in 2012 primarily due to increased interest expense resulting from higher outstanding debt balances and financing costs associated with our acquisition of Amerigroup.Income tax expense decreased $103.9, or 7.9%, to $1,207.3 in 2012, primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in 2012 and, to a lesser extent, lower income from continuing operations before income tax expense. The effective tax rates in 2012 and 2011 were 31.3% and 33.1%, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the impact from the 2012 settlement with the IRS of items related to not-for-profit conversions and corporate reorganizations in prior years, as well as issues related to certain of our acquired companies incurred prior to our acquisition of those companies. This was partially offset by increases due to the impact of non-tax deductible litigation settlement expenses and an increase in our state deferred tax asset valuation allowance attributable to uncertainty associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards.Our net income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 10 basis points to 4.3% in 2012 as compared to 2011 as a result of all factors discussed above. Reportable Segments Results of OperationsWe use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, which are Commercial and Specialty Business; Government Business; and Other. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense and selling, general and administrative expense. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains/losses on investments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, loss on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. For additional information, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, see Note 20, “Segment Information,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 included in this Form 10-K. The discussion of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. -58-Our Commercial and Specialty Business, Government Business, and Other segments’ summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as follows: Change Years Ended December 31 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 2013 2012 2011 $ % $ %Commercial and Specialty Business Operating revenue$38,790.1 $38,852.9 $39,961.2 $(62.8) (0.2)% $(1,108.3) (2.8)%Operating gain$3,093.3 $3,339.7 $3,344.5 $(246.4) (7.4)% $(4.8) (0.1)%Operating margin8.0% 8.6% 8.4% (60)bp 20bpGovernment Business Operating revenue$31,366.7 $21,625.7 $19,874.0 $9,741.0 45.0 % $1,751.7 8.8 %Operating gain$927.1 $341.8 $461.6 $585.3 171.2 % $(119.8) (26.0)%Operating margin3.0% 1.6% 2.3% 140bp (70)bpOther Operating revenue1$34.6 $35.4 $30.0 $(0.8) (2.3)% $5.4 18.0 %Operating loss2$(19.0) $(61.6) $(24.0) $42.6 (69.2)% $(37.6) 156.7 % 1 Fluctuations not material.2 Fluctuations primarily a result of changes in unallocated corporate expenses.Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Commercial and Specialty BusinessOperating revenue decreased $62.8, or 0.2%, to $38,790.1 in 2013, primarily due to fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business resulting from strategic product portfolio changes in certain states, competitive pressure in certain markets and, we believe, affordability challenges affecting healthcare consumers in general. This decrease was partially offset by premium rate increases in our Local Group, Individual and National businesses designed to cover overall cost trends, premium rate and membership increases in our Specialty businesses, primarily related to our dental and vision products, as well as increased administrative fees resulting from pricing increases for self-funded members in our Commercial businesses.Operating gain decreased $246.4, or 7.4%, to $3,093.3 in 2013, primarily as a result of higher selling, general and administrative expenses driven by costs incurred in preparation for the implementation of Health Care Reform provisions that become effective in 2014 as well as increases in allocated incentive compensation as a result of consolidated operating performance. The decrease was further attributable to increased benefit costs in our Individual business. These decreases were partially offset by improved results in our Local Group business resulting from lower than anticipated medical cost trends.The operating margin in 2013 was 8.0%, a 60 basis point decrease over 2012, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.Government BusinessOperating revenue increased $9,741.0, or 45.0%, to $31,366.7 in 2013, primarily due to the acquisition of Amerigroup, growth in our FEP business due to premium rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends, and increases in membership in our CareMore and FEP businesses. These increases were partially offset by membership declines in our non-CareMore Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D businesses related to our product repositioning strategy toward HMO product offerings.Operating gain increased $585.3, or 171.2%, to $927.1 in 2013, primarily due to the acquisition of Amerigroup and -59-improved operating results in the majority of our other government lines of business.The operating margin in 2013 was 3.0%, a 140 basis point increase from 2012, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2011 Commercial and Specialty BusinessOperating revenue decreased $1,108.3, or 2.8%, to $38,852.9 in 2012, primarily due to fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business resulting from strategic product portfolio changes in certain states, competitive pressure in certain markets and unfavorable economic conditions, partially offset by premium rate increases in our Local Group business designed to cover overall cost trends. Partially offsetting the decline in premium revenue was an increase in administrative fees resulting from pricing increases for self-funded members in our National Accounts and Local Group businesses.Operating gain decreased $4.8, or 0.1%, to $3,339.7 in 2012, primarily as a result of declines in our Local Group business due to fully-insured membership losses as a result of strategic product portfolio changes in certain markets, competitive pressure in certain markets and unfavorable economic conditions as well as declines in our Individual business due to higher benefit cost trends. These decreases were partially offset by an improved benefit expense ratio for our Local Group business, including the impact of favorable prior year reserve development in 2012 compared to modest reserve strengthening in 2011.The operating margin in 2012 was 8.6%, a 20 basis point increase from 2011, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Government BusinessOperating revenue increased $1,751.7, or 8.8%, to $21,625.7 in 2012, primarily due to membership growth in our Medicare Advantage business, including CareMore, and, to a lesser extent, growth in our Medicaid business resulting from retroactive premium rate increases in the California market as well as premium revenue from Amerigroup’s operations during the post-acquisition period. Additionally, growth in our FEP business resulting from premium rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends during 2012 contributed to the increase.Operating gain decreased $119.8, or 26.0%, to $341.8 in 2012, primarily due to declines in our Medicaid business due to higher benefit cost trends and increased general and administrative expense resulting from transaction expenses associated with the Amerigroup acquisition and restructuring activities.The operating margin in 2012 was 1.6%, a 70 basis point decrease from 2011, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider our most important accounting policies that require significant estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our other significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, included in this Form 10-K.We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances.-60-Medical Claims Payable The most subjective accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2013, this liability was $6,127.2 and represented 17.6% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 95.5%, or $5,851.0, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2013; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 4.5%, or $276.2, of the total medical claims payable as of December 31, 2013. The level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period end to the next, from 1% to 5% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made.Liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be appropriate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or “trend factors.”Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison of prior year, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense.We regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable.While there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid claims liability as of December 31, 2013 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by other operational -61-variables including system changes, provider submission patterns and business combinations.There is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through twelve months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. In our analysis for the claim liabilities at December 31, 2013, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 40 and 90 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower variability ranging from 0 to 30 basis points.The difference in completion factor assumptions, assuming moderately adverse experience, results in variability of 2%, or approximately $146.0, in the December 31, 2013 incurred but not paid claims liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein.The other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2013 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. In our analysis for the period ended December 31, 2013, there was a 310 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors assuming moderately adverse experience. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 5%, or approximately $279.0, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factors used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claims liability at December 31, 2013. See Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 included in this Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year.” Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. The ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 89.3% for 2013, 89.1% for 2012 and 88.8% for 2011. The increase in these ratios reflects acceleration in processing claims that occurred over the course of the past three years.We calculate the percentage of prior years’ redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior years' net incurred claims payable less prior years’ redundancies in the current year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior years’ reserves. This metric was 10.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013, 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011. The years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 reflect a higher level of targeted reserve for adverse deviation and a resultant higher level of prior years' redundancies than the year ended December 31, 2011.We calculate the percentage of prior years’ redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior years’ net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation supports the reasonableness of our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims and the consistency in our methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2013, this metric was 1.3%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $599.1. This metric was 1.1% for 2012 and 0.5% for 2011.-62-The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 included in this Form 10-K, for each of 2012 and 2011 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims – current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims – prior years redundancies” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 2012 2011Total net incurred medical claims, as reported$47,566.5 $47,071.9Retrospective basis, as described above47,481.0 46,768.0Variance$85.5 $303.9Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported0.2% 0.6%Given that our business is primarily short tailed (which means that medical claims are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider), the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2013 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2014.The 2012 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of 0.2% was smaller in value than the 2011 percentage of 0.6%. The lower 2012 variance was driven by a more consistent level of prior year redundancies in 2013 and 2012 associated with 2012 and 2011 claim payments, respectively. Prior year redundancies in 2011 associated with 2010 claim payments were much lower by comparison, thus creating a higher 2011 variance.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes in accordance with FASB guidance, which requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance.At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following:•the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset;•the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim;•the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and•any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences.We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits, as required by the guidance. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted.In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we intend to defend our positions vigorously through the federal, state and local appeals processes. We believe we have adequately -63-provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact on our results of operations from these matters.For additional information, see Note 8, “Income Taxes,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, included in this Form 10-K.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsOur consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2013 was $16,917.2 and other intangible assets were $8,441.0. The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets represented 42.6% of our total consolidated assets and 102.4% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2013.We follow FASB guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, which include goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately.We complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. These tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Certain interim impairment tests are also performed when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur.Fair value is estimated using the income and market approaches for goodwill at the reporting unit level and the income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. Use of the income and market approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. The income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. These estimated future cash flows are then discounted. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted-average cost of capital. Market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including membership, revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry.With the exception of the treatment associated with our 1-800 CONTACTS disposal, we did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2013 annual impairment tests as the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying values as of December 31, 2013. Additionally, we do not believe that the estimated fair values of our reporting units are at risk of becoming impaired in the next twelve months. However, as a result of certain provisions of Health Care Reform, along with current economic conditions and continued high unemployment rates, we have experienced lower operating margins in certain lines of business. Those margins could become further compressed if unemployment levels remain high and if results from implementation of Health Care Reform are significantly different than anticipated. As a result, the estimated fair values of certain of our reporting units with goodwill could fall below their carrying values in future periods and if that were to occur, we would be required to record impairment losses at that time.While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.For additional information, see Note 3, ""Business Acquisitions and Divestitures"" and Note 10, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, included in this Form 10-K. -64-Investments Current and long-term available-for-sale investment securities were $19,254.9 at December 31, 2013 and represented 32.3% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2013. We classify fixed maturity and equity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” or “trading” and report those securities at fair value. Certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity.We review investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. In addition, for equity securities, we determine whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time to allow for a recovery of its fair value above its carrying amount. If any declines of equity securities are determined to be other-than-temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made.Certain FASB other-than-temporary impairment, or FASB OTTI, guidance applies to fixed maturity securities and provides guidance on the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments. In addition, this FASB OTTI guidance requires disclosures related to other-than-temporary impairments. If a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and is recorded to other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income in our consolidated income statements. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, the credit component of the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income in our consolidated statements of income and the non-credit component of the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in other comprehensive income. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment is determined by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of acquisition. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other debt securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings, and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default.We have a committee of accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. The current economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets.We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. This could result in other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments being charged against future income. Given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional, material other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments may be recorded in future periods.In addition to available-for-sale investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $1,542.6, or 2.6% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2013. These long-term investments consisted primarily of certain other equity -65-investments, cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and real estate. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term.Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage the market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits on investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future earnings and financial position. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $17,488.1 at December 31, 2013. The weighted-average credit rating of these securities was “A” as of December 31, 2013. Included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions and mortgage-backed securities of $1,699.8 and $9.7, respectively, that are guaranteed by third parties. With the exception of eleven securities with a fair value of $9.7, these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2013. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities without the guarantee was “AA” as of December 31, 2013 for the securities for which such information is available.Fair values of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with FASB guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. We have controls in place to review the third party pricing services’ qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. In addition, we periodically review the third party pricing services’ pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable.We obtain only one quoted price for each security from third party pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. For securities not actively traded, the third party pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform monthly analysis on the prices received from third parties to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes a review of month-to-month price fluctuations. If unusual fluctuations are noted in this review, we may obtain additional information from other pricing services to validate the quoted price. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from third party pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.In certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. Such securities are designated Level III in accordance with FASB guidance. Securities designated Level III at December 31, 2013 totaled $177.9 and represented less than 1% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level III securities primarily consisted of certain corporate securities, equity securities and structured securities for which observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using internal estimates for inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields.For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in this Form 10-K, and Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” Note 5, “Investments,” and Note 7, “Fair Value,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, included in this Form 10-K.Retirement Benefits Pension BenefitsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for some of our employees. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FASB guidance for retirement benefits, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by the guidance, we calculate the value of plan assets as described below. Further, the difference -66-between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods. An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our December 31, 2013 measurement date, we selected a weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.66%, consistent with our prior year assumption. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and an average of historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase.This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date, December 31, 2013. The selected weighted-average discount rate was 4.39%, which was developed using a yield curve approach. Using yields available on high-quality fixed maturity securities with various maturity dates, the yield curve approach provides a “customized” rate, which is meant to match the expected cash flows of our specific benefit plans. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FASB guidance.In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities, equity securities and alternative investments across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow.Other Postretirement BenefitsWe provide most associates with certain medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits.At our December 31, 2013 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 4.48%, compared to a discount rate of 3.71% at the December 31, 2012 measurement date. We developed this rate using a yield curve approach as described above.The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of pre-Medicare (those who are not currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2013 measurement date was 8.00% for 2014 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2025. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of post-Medicare (those who are currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2013 measurement date was 6.00% for 2014 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2021. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2013 by $44.2 and would increase service and interest costs by $1.8. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by $38.1 as of December 31, 2013 and would decrease service and interest costs by $1.5.For additional information regarding our retirement benefits, see Note 11, “Retirement Benefits,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, included in this Form 10-K.-67-New Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended December 31, 2013 that had, or are expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures, see the “New Accounting Pronouncements” section of Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, included in this Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesIntroductionOur cash receipts result primarily from premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity.We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy.A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations.The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. The securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility, although current market conditions are more stable. During recent years, the Federal Government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to restore liquidity in the financial markets and to help relieve the credit crisis and strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. In addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide liquidity and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions. We have a $2,500.0 commercial paper program. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we intend to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our $2,000.0 senior revolving credit facility to redeem our commercial paper when it matures. While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we believe the lenders participating in our credit facility will be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. In addition to the $2,000.0 senior revolving credit facility, we estimate that we will receive approximately $2,100.0 of dividends from our subsidiaries during 2014, which also provides further operating and financial flexibility. -68-The table below outlines the cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: Years Ended December 31 2013 2012 2011Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities$3,052.3 $2,744.6 $3,374.4Investing activities(2,234.4) (4,551.6) (942.0)Financing activities(1,717.8) 2,088.9 (2,019.2)Effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents2.2 1.1 (0.4)(Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents$(897.7) $283.0 $412.8Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 During the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $3,052.3, compared to $2,744.6 for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $307.7. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items, primarily due to the loss on disposal of discontinued operations, changes in amortization expense and realized losses on extinguishment of debt. The increase was further attributable to an increase in net cash flow provided by Amerigroup as 2012 included post-acquisition change-in-control payments and transaction costs that did not recur in 2013. Additionally, the increase was due to a net increase in the collection of income tax refunds in 2013.Net cash flow used in investing activities was $2,234.4 during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $4,551.6 for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in cash flow used in investing activities of $2,317.2 primarily resulted from a decrease in cash used for the purchase of subsidiaries, as net cash used in investing activities for 2012 included the acquisitions of Amerigroup and 1-800 CONTACTS, while there were no purchases of subsidiaries in 2013. This decrease was partially offset by the net change in investment activity and changes in securities lending collateral.Net cash flow used in financing activities was $1,717.8 during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to net cash flow provided by financing activities of $2,088.9 for the year ended December 31, 2012. The change in cash flow from financing activities of $3,806.7 primarily resulted from an increase in long-term borrowings in 2012 primarily used to fund the acquisition of Amerigroup compared to an increase in net repayments of long-term borrowings in 2013. The change in cash flow from financing activity was further attributable to a decrease in common stock repurchases, changes in securities lending payable, and an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. Liquidity— Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 During the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $2,744.6, compared to $3,374.4 for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $629.8. This decrease was driven primarily by payments related to the run-out of medical claims for former members, net operating cash outflows by our Amerigroup subsidiary during the post-acquisition period (including claims payments, change-in-control payments and payments for transaction costs), increased litigation settlement payments and the addition of required minimum MLR rebate payments in 2012 (which were established as liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2011).Net cash flow used in investing activities was $4,551.6 during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $942.0 for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in cash flow used in investing activities of $3,609.6 between the two periods primarily resulted from an increase in the purchase of subsidiaries, reflecting the acquisitions of Amerigroup and 1-800 CONTACTS during 2012, and an increase in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by changes in securities lending collateral and an increase in the net proceeds from the sales of investments.Net cash flow provided by financing activities was $2,088.9 during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to net cash flow used in financing activities of $2,019.2 for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in cash flow provided by financing activities of $4,108.1 primarily resulted from an increase in net proceeds from long-term borrowings and a decrease in common stock repurchases, partially offset by changes in bank overdrafts, changes in securities lending payable and a decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans.-69-Financial Condition We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, of $22,395.9 at December 31, 2013. Since December 31, 2012, total cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, decreased by $68.7 primarily due to common stock repurchases, purchases of property and equipment, net repayments of borrowings and cash dividends paid to shareholders. These decreases were partially offset by cash generated from operations and proceeds from employee stock option exercises.Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Certain accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities, or statutory accounting practices, differ from GAAP. Changes that occur in statutory accounting practices, if any, could impact our subsidiaries' future dividend capacity. In addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries.At December 31, 2013, we held $2,164.5 of cash and cash equivalents and investments at the parent company, which are available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, potential future common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders, repurchases of debt securities and debt and interest payments. We calculate our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, a non-GAAP measure, which we believe assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. In addition, our bank covenants include a maximum debt-to-capital ratio that we cannot exceed. Our targeted range of debt-to-capital ratio is 30% to 35%. Our debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt plus shareholders’ equity. Our debt-to-capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio was 36.9% and 38.6% as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The higher than targeted consolidated debt-to-capital ratios at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 were primarily due to the increased debt we incurred to finance our acquisition of Amerigroup in 2012 and we expect in time to return to targeted levels.Our senior debt is rated “A-” by Standard & Poor’s, “BBB+” by Fitch, Inc., “Baa2” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. A significant downgrade in our debt ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs.Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity We have a shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries and the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion.We have a senior credit facility, or the facility, with certain lenders for general corporate purposes. The facility, as amended, provides credit up to $2,000.0 and matures on September 29, 2016. The interest rate on the facility is based on either (i) the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined percentage rate based on our credit rating at the date of utilization, or (ii) a base rate as defined in the facility agreement plus a predetermined percentage rate based on our credit rating at the date of utilization. Our ability to borrow under the facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. There were no amounts outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2013.We have an authorized commercial paper program of up to $2,500.0, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, $379.2 and $570.9, respectively, were outstanding under our commercial paper program. Commercial paper borrowings have been classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2013 and 2012 as our practice and intent is to replace short-term commercial paper outstanding at expiration with additional short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one year and we have the ability to redeem our commercial paper with borrowings under the senior credit facility described above.We are a member, through certain subsidiaries, of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, collectively, the FHLBs, and as a member we have the -70-ability to obtain short-term cash advances subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, $400.0 and $250.0, respectively, were outstanding under our short-term FHLBs borrowings.On July 30, 2013, we initiated a cash tender offer and consent solicitation to purchase certain of our outstanding 5.875% Notes due 2017, 7.000% Notes due 2019, 5.950% Notes due 2034, 5.850% Notes due 2036, 6.375% Notes due 2037 and 5.800% Notes due 2040 (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”). On August 13, 2013, we repurchased $700.0 of the Tendered Notes for cash totaling $837.7. Holders who tendered their notes prior to the early tender date received the principal amounts, applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the early tender offer settlement date. Additionally, on September 5, 2013, we redeemed the $400.0 outstanding principal balance of our 6.000% senior unsecured notes due 2014, plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, for cash totaling $411.0. In connection with our early redemption and repurchase of the $1,100.0 aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes, we realized losses on debt extinguishment of $145.3.On July 30, 2013, we issued $650.0 of 2.300% notes due 2018 and $600.0 of 5.100% notes due 2044 under our shelf registration statement. We used the proceeds from this offering in part to fund the purchase price of the Tendered Notes and the 6.000% senior unsecured notes discussed above, and the balance for general corporate purposes. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2014. The notes have a call feature that allows us to repurchase the notes at any time at our option and a put feature that allows a note holder to require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the notes below an investment grade rating.As a result of our acquisition of Amerigroup on December 24, 2012, the carrying amount of $556.9 of Amerigroup’s $475.0 of 7.500% senior unsecured notes due 2019 were included in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012. On January 25, 2013, we redeemed the outstanding principal balance of these notes, plus applicable premium for early redemption, for cash totaling $555.6. The weighted-average redemption price of the notes was approximately 117% of the principal amount outstanding.While we generally issue senior unsecured notes for long-term borrowing purposes, on October 9, 2012, we issued $1,500.0 of senior convertible debentures, or the Debentures. The Debentures are governed by an indenture, or the Indenture, dated as of October 9, 2012 between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The Debentures bear interest at a rate of 2.750% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on April 15 and October 15 of each year, and mature on October 15, 2042, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted into shares of common stock at the applicable conversion rate. We used approximately $371.0 of the net proceeds from the issuance to repurchase shares of our common stock concurrently with the offering of the Debentures, and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including but not limited to additional purchases of shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program and the repayment of debt. For additional information related to the Debentures, including the circumstances under which holders may convert the Debentures into common stock, see Note 13, “Debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, included in this Form 10-K.As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we are currently estimating approximately $2,100.0 of dividends to be paid to the parent company during 2014. During 2013, we received $3,046.5 of dividends from our subsidiaries.We regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including common stock repurchases, repurchases of debt securities and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt securities are at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.-71-A summary of the cash dividend activity for the year ended December 31, 2013 is as follows:Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date CashDividendper Share TotalFebruary 20, 2013 March 8, 2013 March 25, 2013 $0.3750 $113.4May 15, 2013 June 10, 2013 June 25, 2013 0.3750 112.7July 23, 2013 September 10, 2013 September 25, 2013 0.3750 111.4October 22, 2013 December 9, 2013 December 23, 2013 0.3750 110.5On January 28, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.4375 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on March 25, 2014 to shareholders of record as of March 10, 2014.A summary of common stock repurchases for the period January 1, 2014 through February 7, 2014 (subsequent to December 31, 2013) and for the year ended December 31, 2013 is as follows: January 1, 2014ThroughFebruary 7, 2014 Year EndedDecember 31,2013Shares repurchased5.4 20.7Average price per share$84.96 $78.08Aggregate cost$457.6 $1,620.1Authorization remaining at the end of each period$2,633.4 $3,691.0On February 4, 2014, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, program with a counterparty. The agreement provides for a repurchase of a number of shares, equal to $600.0, as determined by the dollar volume weighted-average share price during a period up through at least March 14, 2014, but not to exceed March 31, 2014. At the end of the term of the ASR, the initial amount of shares will be adjusted up or down based on the dollar volume weighted-average price during the same period. On February 4, 2014, we repurchased 6.0 shares under this program. These ASR shares are not included in the shares repurchased subsequent to December 31, 2013, shown in the table above as the final shares to be repurchased will not be determined until the completion of the program in March 2014. However, the $600.0 has been removed from the authorization remaining as of February 7, 2014 in the table above.On September 25, 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a $3,500.0 increase to the common stock repurchase program. We expect to utilize unused authorization remaining at December 31, 2013 over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares when we believe it is a prudent use of capital.Our current retirement benefits funding strategy is to fund an amount at least equal to the minimum required funding as determined under ERISA with consideration of maximum tax deductible amounts. We may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2013, no material contributions were necessary to meet ERISA required funding levels. However, during the year ended December 31, 2013, we made tax deductible discretionary contributions to the pension benefit plans of $38.6.-72-Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2013 are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 YearsDebt1 $23,297.7 $1,489.9 $2,838.5 $3,148.0 $15,821.3Operating lease commitments769.3 133.0 226.3 188.4 221.6Projected other postretirement benefits440.7 43.4 133.2 135.9 128.2Purchase obligations: IBM outsourcing agreements2 251.2 200.3 50.9 — —Other purchase obligations3 2,757.2 1,499.3 780.1 450.0 27.8Other long-term liabilities4 912.2 — 377.6 347.2 187.4Investment commitments341.6 148.9 111.7 61.1 19.9Total contractual obligations and commitments$28,769.9 $3,514.8 $4,518.3 $4,330.6 $16,406.2 1Includes estimated interest expense. 2Relates to agreements with International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, to provide information technology infrastructure services. See Note 14, “Commitments and Contingences,” to the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 included in this Form 10-K for further information.3Includes obligations related to non-IBM information technology service agreements and telecommunication contracts.4Estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from this table as we had no funding requirements under ERISA at December 31, 2013 as a result of the value of the assets in the plans. In addition, amount includes other obligations resulting from third-party service contracts.The above table does not contain $121.5 of gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions and interest for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities. See Note 8, “Income Taxes,” to the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 included in this Form 10-K for further information.In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our senior credit facility or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that will require funding in future periods.Risk-Based CapitalOur regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies and health maintenance organizations largely based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under the RBC Model Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our regulated subsidiaries' respective RBC levels as of December 31, 2013, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, were in excess of all mandatory RBC thresholds. In addition to exceeding -73-the RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries.For additional information, see Note 22, “Statutory Information,"" to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, included in this Form 10-K.

(In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein)As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2013. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return.InvestmentsOur investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk.The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit event, such as a ratings downgrade or default, to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that event. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately “A.” Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which represent an exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value.Our available-for-sale investment portfolio includes corporate securities which account for 40.0% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2013 and are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. We manage this risk through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of our corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately “BBB.”Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systemic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio.As of December 31, 2013, 90.8% of our available-for-sale investments were fixed maturity securities. Market risk is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $783.2 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $807.7 increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly.As of December 31, 2013, 9.2% of our available-for-sale investments were equity securities. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $176.7. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $176.7.For additional information regarding our investments, see Note 5, “Investments”, to our audited consolidated financial -75-statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, and “Investments” within “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Form 10-K.Long-Term DebtOur total long-term debt at December 31, 2013 was $14,091.6, and included $379.2 of commercial paper. The carrying values of the commercial paper approximate fair value as the underlying instruments have variable interest rates at market value. The remainder of the debt includes senior unsecured notes, convertible debentures and subordinated surplus notes by one of our insurance subsidiaries. This debt is subject to interest rate risk as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. The senior unsecured notes had combined carrying and estimated fair value of $12,721.5 and $12,987.0, respectively, at December 31, 2013. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the convertible debentures were $966.0 and $2,030.6, respectively, at December 31, 2013. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the surplus notes were $24.9 and $27.3, respectively, at December 31, 2013.Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. For additional information regarding our long-term debt, see Note 7, ""Fair Value"" and Note 13, “Debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, included in this Form 10-K.DerivativesWe have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts, which are used to lock-in interest rates or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. We have used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities.Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these derivatives. As of December 31, 2013, we recorded a net asset of $10.2, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swap’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $52.9 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $52.9 increase in fair value.We also utilize put and call options on the S&P 500 index to hedge, on an economic basis, the exposure of our equity security portfolio to fluctuations in the equity markets. While the impact of fluctuations in the equity markets on these derivatives are largely offset by changes in the fair values of our equity security portfolio, the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized immediately in our income statement, whereas the change in fair value of our equity securities is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Accordingly, a decrease in the S&P 500 index of 10% would result in an approximate increase of $38.3 in the fair value of these derivatives. An increase in the S&P 500 index of 10% would result in an approximate decrease of $18.8 in the fair value of these derivatives.For additional information regarding our derivatives, see Note 6, “Derivative Financial Instruments” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, included in this Form 10-K. Also for accounting related to securities in our equity portfolio, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments” within Part II, Item 7 “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Form 10-K.-76-",2023-12-30 18:53:31.754481

(In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein) On November 5, 2014, the shareholders of the Company approved a proposal to amend our articles of incorporation to change our name to Anthem, Inc. from WellPoint, Inc. The name change was effective December 2, 2014. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Anthem” or the “Company” refer to Anthem, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and, unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries.This Management's Discussion and Analysis, or MD&A, should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.OverviewWe currently manage our operations through three reportable segments: Commercial and Specialty Business, Government Business and Other. We regularly evaluate the appropriateness of our reportable segments, particularly in light of organizational changes, merger and acquisition activity and changing laws and regulations. Therefore, these reportable segments may change in the future. Our Commercial and Specialty Business segment includes our Local Group, National Accounts, Individual and Specialty businesses. Business units in the Commercial and Specialty Business segment offer fully-insured health products; provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management, disease management, wellness programs and other administrative services; and provide an array of specialty and other insurance products and services such as dental, vision, life and disability insurance benefits, radiology benefit management and analytics-driven personal health care guidance.Our Government Business segment includes Medicare and Medicaid businesses, National Government Services, or NGS, and services provided to the federal government in connection with the Federal Employee Program, or FEP. Medicare business includes services such as Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and Medicare Supplement. Medicaid business includes our managed care alternatives through publicly funded health care programs, including Medicaid; Temporary Assistance for Needy Family, or TANF, programs; programs for seniors and people with disabilities, or SPD; programs for long-term services and support, or LTSS; Children’s Health Insurance Programs, or CHIP, and Medicaid expansion programs. NGS acts as a Medicare contractor in several regions across the nation. Our Other segment includes other businesses that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, guidance, as well as corporate expenses not allocated to the other reportable segments.Our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue comes from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. Administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, or where the fee is based on either processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized. Additionally, we earn administrative fee revenues from our Medicare processing business and from other health-related businesses including disease management programs. Other revenue includes miscellaneous income other than premium revenue and administrative fees.Our benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. While we offer a diversified mix of managed care products and services through our managed care plans, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products and services. Our managed care plans include: preferred provider organizations, -44-or PPOs; health maintenance organizations, or HMOs; point-of-service plans, or POS plans; traditional indemnity plans and other hybrid plans, including consumer-driven health plans, or CDHPs; and hospital only and limited benefit products. We classify certain claims-related costs as benefit expense to reflect costs incurred for our members’ traditional medical care, as well as those expenses which improve our members’ health and medical outcomes. These claims-related costs may be comprised of expenses incurred for: (i) medical management, including case and utilization management; (ii) health and wellness, including disease management services for such conditions as diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, congestive heart failure and asthma management and wellness initiatives like weight-loss programs and smoking cessation treatments; and (iii) clinical health policy. These types of claims-related costs are designed to ultimately lower our members’ cost of care. Our selling expense consists of external broker commission expenses, and generally varies with premium or membership volume. Our general and administrative expense consists of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium, but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels, and thus associated compensation expense. Other variable costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity.Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management and health and wellness programs. Several economic factors related to health care costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating health care costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers and any regulatory or market driven restrictions on our ability to obtain adequate premium rates to offset overall inflation in health care costs, including increases in unit costs and utilization resulting from the aging of the population and other demographics, as well as advances in medical technology, may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material impact on our results of operations.Our future results of operations will also be impacted by certain external forces and resulting changes in our business model and strategy. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, as well as the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, Health Care Reform, became law, causing significant changes to the U.S. health care system. Since then, significant regulations have been enacted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury. The legislation and regulations are far-reaching and are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage over time by increasing the eligibility thresholds for most state Medicaid programs and providing certain other individuals and small businesses with tax credits to subsidize a portion of the cost of health insurance coverage. As a result of the complexity of the law, its impact on health care in the United States and the continuing modification and interpretation of Health Care Reform rules, we continue to analyze and refine our estimates of the ultimate impact of Health Care Reform on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Health Care Reform provides growth opportunities for health insurers, but also introduces new risks and uncertainties, and required changes in the way products are designed, underwritten, priced, distributed and administered. For additional discussion, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Regulation,” and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Pricing in our Commercial and Specialty Business segment, including our Individual and Small Group lines of business, remains competitive, but rational, and we strive to price our health care benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends. We believe our pricing strategy, based on predictive modeling, proprietary research and data-driven processes, as well as our overall investments for Health Care Reform, have positioned us to benefit from the potential growth opportunities available in fully-insured commercial products as a result of Health Care Reform. In the Individual and Small Group markets, we offer on-exchange products through state or federally facilitated marketplaces, referred to as public exchanges; and off-exchange products. Federal premium subsidies are available only for certain members who purchase certain public exchange products. While the ultimate level of public exchange enrollment cannot be predicted, we have experienced a greater number of policy applications for new members through the public exchanges than expected, including geographical regions with lower price competition. The public exchanges may increase the risk that our products will be selected by individuals who have a higher risk profile or utilization rate than the pool of participants we anticipated when we -45-established the pricing for these public exchange products. However, the risk characteristics of new applicants in 2014 tracked closely to the risk levels utilized in the development of our pricing assumptions. Although it is not yet clear whether our products sold on the public exchanges will be more or less profitable products, we believe that our pricing strategy, brand name and network quality will provide a strong foundation for commercial risk membership growth opportunities in the future. In our Individual markets we offer bronze, silver and gold products, both on and off the public exchanges, in the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. Additionally, we offer platinum products, both on and off the public exchanges, in the states of California and New York. In our Small Group markets, we offer bronze, silver and gold products, both on and off the public exchanges, in the states of Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio and Virginia and we offer bronze, silver and gold products, off the public exchanges, in the states of California, New York and Wisconsin. Additionally, we offer platinum products, off the public exchanges, in the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maine, New Hampshire, Missouri and Virginia.Private exchanges have recently gained significant visibility in the marketplace based on the promise of helping employers reduce costs, increase consumer engagement and manage the complexities created by the ACA and other market forces. While private exchanges have been a distribution channel in the Medicare and Individual markets for some time, the heightened level of activity and investment among the consulting and broker communities and other health insurance carriers has generated an increasing level of interest among employers in the Commercial market. To date, adoption levels have been lower than analyst predictions, but expectations for significant longer term growth remain. While the ultimate volume, pace of growth and winning business models remain highly uncertain, we believe private exchanges will provide opportunities for growth and will serve a significant role in our future strategy. Health Care Reform also imposes new regulations on the health insurance sector, including, but not limited to, guaranteed coverage and expanded benefit requirements; prohibitions on some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to our members; increased restrictions on rescinding coverage; establishment of minimum medical loss ratio, or MLR, and customer rebate requirements; establishment of a mandatory annual Health Insurance Provider Fee, or HIP Fee; creation of a federal rate review process; a requirement to cover preventive services on a first dollar basis; the establishment of public exchanges and essential benefit packages and greater limitations on how we price certain of our products. The legislation also reduces the reimbursement levels for our health plans participating in the Medicare Advantage program over time. There are also limitations on the amount of executive compensation that is deductible for income tax purposes.As a result of Health Care Reform, HHS issued MLR regulations that require us to meet minimum MLR thresholds for Large Group, Small Group and Individual lines of business. For purposes of determining MLR rebates, HHS has defined the types of costs that should be included in the MLR rebate calculation. However, certain components of the MLR calculation as defined by HHS cannot be classified consistently under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. While considered benefit expense or a reduction of premium revenue by HHS, certain of these costs are classified as other types of expense, such as income tax expense or selling, general and administrative expense, in our GAAP basis financial statements. Accordingly, the benefit expense ratio determined using our consolidated GAAP operating results is not comparable to the MLR calculated under HHS regulations. Health Care Reform also imposed a separate minimum MLR threshold of 85% for Medicare Advantage plans beginning in 2014. Medicare Advantage plans that do not meet this threshold will have to pay a minimum MLR rebate. If a plan’s MLR is below 85% for three consecutive years beginning with 2014, enrollment will be restricted. A Medicare Advantage plan contract will be terminated if the plan's MLR is below 85% for five consecutive years. Beginning in 2014, Health Care Reform imposes an annual HIP Fee on health insurers that write certain types of health insurance on U.S. risks. The annual HIP Fee is allocated to health insurers based on the ratio of the amount of an insurer's net premium revenues written during the preceding calendar year to an adjusted amount of health insurance for all U.S. health risk for those certain lines of business written during the preceding calendar year. The HIP Fee is non-deductible for federal income tax purposes. The total amount to be collected from allocations to health insurers in 2014 was $8,000.0, and our portion of the HIP Fee for 2014 was $893.3. The final calculation and payment of the HIP Fee occurred in the third quarter of 2014 and was recognized as a general and administrative expense. The annual HIP Fee to be allocated to all health insurers -46-increases to $11,300.0 for 2015 and 2016, $13,900.0 for 2017 and $14,300.0 for 2018. For 2019 and beyond, the annual HIP Fee will increase from the amount for the preceding year by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year. These and other provisions of Health Care Reform are likely to have significant effects on our future operations, which, in turn, could impact the value of our business model and results of operations, including potential impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets. We will continue to evaluate the impact of Health Care Reform as key aspects go into effect and additional guidance is made available. For additional discussion regarding Health Care Reform, see Part I, Item 1 “Business—Regulation” and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Finally, federal and state regulatory agencies may further restrict our ability to obtain new product approvals, implement changes in premium rates or impose additional restrictions, under new or existing laws that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.We are also subject to regulations that may result in assessments under state insurance guarantee association laws. The National Organization of Life & Health Insurance Guaranty Associations, or NOLHGA, is a voluntary organization consisting of the state life and health insurance guaranty associations located throughout the U.S. Such associations, working together with NOLHGA, provide a safety net for their state’s policyholders, ensuring that they continue to receive coverage, subject to state maximum limits, even if their insurer is declared insolvent. We are aware that the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner, or Insurance Commissioner, has placed Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary American Network Insurance Company, or collectively Penn Treaty, in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency. The state court denied the Insurance Commissioner’s petition for the liquidation of Penn Treaty and ordered the Insurance Commissioner to file an updated plan of rehabilitation. An initial plan was filed on April 30, 2013. The Insurance Commissioner filed an amended plan on August 8, 2014 and a second amended plan on October 8, 2014. The state court set a schedule for a notice and comment period and ordered a hearing on the second amended plan, with public comments due by February 13, 2015. The Insurance Commissioner has filed a Notice of Appeal asking the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to reverse the order denying the liquidation petition. The Supreme Court held oral argument on the appeal in September 2014. In the event rehabilitation of Penn Treaty is unsuccessful and Penn Treaty is declared insolvent and placed in liquidation, we and other insurers may be required to pay a portion of their policyholder claims through state guaranty association assessments in future periods. Given the uncertainty around whether Penn Treaty will ultimately be declared insolvent and, if so, the amount of the insolvency, the amount and timing of any associated future guaranty fund assessments, and the availability and amount of any potential premium tax and other offsets, we currently cannot estimate our net exposure, if any, to this potential insolvency. We will continue to monitor the situation and may record a liability and expense in future reporting periods, which could be material to our cash flows and results of operations.In addition to the external forces discussed in the preceding paragraphs, our results of operations are impacted by levels and mix of membership. In recent history, we experienced membership declines due to unfavorable economic conditions driving increased unemployment. In addition, we believe the self-insured portion of our group membership base will continue to increase as a percentage of total group membership. Further, our mix of membership may include more individuals with a higher acuity level obtaining coverage through our products available on the public exchanges, which may not be appropriately adjusted for in our premium rates. These membership trends could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. In February 2015, we reported that we were the target of a sophisticated external cyber attack. The attackers gained unauthorized access to certain of our information technology systems and obtained personal information related to many of our current and former members and employees. We are in the process of determining the extent of this cyber attack and are supporting federal law enforcement efforts to identify the responsible parties. For additional information about the cyber attack, see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies - Data Breach,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Also see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of the factors identified above and other risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time.-47-Executive SummaryWe are one of the largest health benefits companies in terms of medical membership in the United States, serving 37.5 medical members through our affiliated health plans as of December 31, 2014. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or BCBS, licensee for Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (as BCBS in 10 New York City metropolitan and surrounding counties, and as Blue Cross or BCBS in selected upstate counties only), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, or Empire Blue Cross (in our New York service areas). We also conduct business through arrangements with other BCBS licensees in the states of South Carolina and Texas. We conduct business through our AMERIGROUP Corporation, or Amerigroup, subsidiary, in Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. We also serve customers throughout the country as HealthLink, UniCare (including a non-risk arrangement with the state of Massachusetts), and in certain Arizona, California, Nevada, New York and Virginia markets through our CareMore Health Group, Inc., or CareMore, subsidiary. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states through our subsidiaries. On February 17, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Simply Healthcare Holdings, Inc., or Simply Healthcare, a leading managed care company for people enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare programs in the state of Florida. This acquisition, which was originally announced on December 22, 2014, aligns with our strategy for continued growth in our Government Business segment. As a result, we will, through our affiliated Medicaid and Medicare plans, serve more than half a million members in the state of Florida. In preparation for the recent and ongoing changes to the U.S. health care system and to focus on our core growth opportunities across our Commercial and Specialty Business and Government Business segments, we entered into a definitive agreement in December 2013 to sell our 1-800 CONTACTS, Inc., or 1-800 CONTACTS, business to the private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. Concurrently, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Luxottica Group to sell our glasses.com related assets. The divestitures were completed on January 31, 2014. The operating results for 1-800 CONTACTS are reported as discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of income included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These results were previously reported in the Commercial and Specialty Business segment. Additionally, the assets and liabilities of 1-800-CONTACTS are reported as held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2013 in the consolidated balance sheets included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless otherwise specified, all financial information disclosed in this MD&A is from continuing operations, other than net income, diluted earnings per share and cash flows. In accordance with FASB guidance, we have elected to not separately disclose net cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities and the net effect of those cash flows on cash and cash equivalents for discontinued operations during the periods presented. For additional information regarding these transactions, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,"" to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $73,021.7, an increase of $2,830.3, or 4.0%, from the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in operating revenue was primarily a result of higher premium revenue in our Government Business segment, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees in our Commercial and Specialty Business segment. These increases were partially offset by lower premium revenue in our Commercial and Specialty Business segment. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2,569.7, an increase of $80.0, or 3.2%, from the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher operating results in both our Government Business segment and our Commercial and Specialty Business segment. In addition, net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was impacted by a loss from discontinued operations recorded in relation to the sale of our 1-800 CONTACTS business. The increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was further attributable to a decrease in realized losses on the early extinguishment of debt, a decrease in amortization of intangible assets and an increase in net earnings from investment activities. These increases were partially offset by an increase in income tax expense primarily due to the non-tax deductible portion of new fees associated with Health Care Reform that became effective January 1, 2014.-48-Our diluted earnings per share, or EPS, for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $8.99, an increase of $0.79, or 9.6%, from the year ended December 31, 2013. Our diluted EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $8.96, an increase of $0.29, or 3.3%, from the year ended December 31, 2013. Our diluted shares for the year ended December 31, 2014 were 285.9, a decrease of 17.9, or 5.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in diluted EPS resulted primarily from the lower number of shares outstanding in 2014 due to share buyback activity under our share repurchase program and the increase in net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $3,369.3, or 1.3 times net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $3,052.3, or 1.2 times net income. The increase in operating cash flow from 2013 of $317.0 was primarily attributable to an increase in premium receipts primarily as a result of rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and new fees associated with Health Care Reform and an increase in administrative fee receipts primarily as a result of growth in membership. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was offset, in part, by payments for new fees associated with Health Care Reform, including the HIP Fee and assessments related to the Health Care Reform reinsurance premium stabilization program. The increase was further offset by an increase in claims payments primarily as a result of membership growth, an increase in personnel service costs and an increase in income taxes paid.Our results of operations discussed throughout this MD&A are determined in accordance with GAAP. We also calculate operating gain, which is a non-GAAP measure, to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results and comparing them among periods. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, and selling, general and administrative expense. We use this measure as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and forecasting future operating periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income before income tax expense, net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional details on operating gain, see our “Reportable Segments Results of Operations” discussion included in this MD&A. For a reconciliation of reportable segment operating gain to income from continuing operations before income tax expense, see Note 19, ""Segment Information,"" to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We intend to expand through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and efficient use of capital in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. While we have achieved strong growth as a result of strategic mergers and acquisitions, we have also achieved organic growth in our existing markets over time by delivering excellent service, offering competitively priced products, providing access to high quality provider networks and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks.Significant TransactionsWhile Health Care Reform has caused significant changes to the U.S. health care system in recent years, the more significant transactions that have occurred over the last three years that have impacted or will impact our capital structure or that have or will influence how we conduct our business operations include:•Acquisition of Simply Healthcare (2015);•Use of Capital—Board of Directors declaration of dividends on common stock (2014 and prior) and a 42.9% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.6250 per share (2015); authorization for repurchases of our common stock (2014 and prior); and debt repurchases and new debt issuance (2014 and prior);•Acquisition of Amerigroup and the related debt issuance (2012); and•Acquisition of 1-800 CONTACTS (2012) and subsequent divestiture (2014).For additional information regarding these transactions, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” Note 12, ""Debt"" and Note 14, “Capital Stock,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.-49-MembershipOur medical membership includes seven different customer types: Local Group, Individual, National Accounts, BlueCard®, Medicare, Medicaid and FEP. BCBS-branded business generally refers to members in our service areas licensed by the BCBSA. Non-BCBS-branded business refers to Amerigroup and CareMore members as well as Healthlink and UniCare members predominantly outside of our BCBSA service areas.•Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. In addition, Local Group includes UniCare members and, effective January 1, 2014, the Employer Group Medicare Advantage members related to Local Group are reported as part of Local Group membership. These are retired members of Local Group accounts who have selected a Medicare Advantage product and were previously reported with our Medicare membership within our Government Business Segment. The Employer Group Medicare Advantage members represent less than 1.0% of Local Group membership. Local Group accounts are generally sold through brokers or consultants working with industry specialists from our in-house sales force and are offered both on and off the public exchanges. Local Group insurance premiums may be based on claims incurred by the group or sold on a self-insured basis. The customer’s buying decision is typically based upon the size and breadth of our networks, customer service, the quality of our medical management services, the administrative cost included in our quoted price, our financial stability, reputation and our ability to effectively service large complex accounts. Local Group accounted for 40.4%, 41.3% and 40.6% of our medical members at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.•Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. Individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, retail partnerships, our in-house sales force or via the Internet. Individual business is sold on a fully-insured basis. We offer on-exchange products through public exchanges and off-exchange products. Federal premium subsidies are available only for certain public exchange Individual products. Individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network, and the efficiency of administration. Account turnover is generally higher with Individual as compared to Local Group. Individual business accounted for 4.8%, 4.9% and 5.1% of our medical members at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.•National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in an Anthem service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker relationships. Service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. National Accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. We have an advantage when competing for very large National Accounts due to the size and breadth of our networks and our ability to access the national provider networks of BCBS companies at their competitive local market rates. Additionally, effective January 1, 2014, the Employer Group Medicare Advantage members related to National Accounts groups are reported as part of National Accounts membership. These are retired members of a National Accounts group who have selected a Medicare Advantage product and were previously reported with our Medicare membership within our Government Business segment. The Employer Group Medicare Advantage members represent less than 1.0% of National Accounts membership. National Accounts represented 19.1%, 19.0% and 19.4% of our medical members at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.•BlueCard® host customers represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by Anthem who receive health care services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard® membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard® program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which an Anthem subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-Anthem controlled BCBSA licensee (i.e., the “home plan”). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard® members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard® members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard® claims received per month. BlueCard® host membership accounted for 14.1%, 14.2% and 13.9% of our medical members at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.-50-•Medicare customers are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a managed care alternative for the Medicare program, who have purchased Medicare Supplement benefit coverage, some disabled under age 65, or all ages with End Stage Renal Disease. Medicare Supplement policies are sold to Medicare recipients as supplements to the benefits they receive from the Medicare program. Rates are filed with and in some cases approved by state insurance departments. Most of the premium for Medicare Advantage is paid directly by the federal government on behalf of the participant who may also be charged a small premium. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. Medicare business accounted for 3.7%, 4.0% and 4.3% of our medical members at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.•Medicaid membership represents eligible members who receive health care benefits through publicly funded health care programs, including Medicaid, TANF, SPD, LTSS, CHIP and Medicaid expansion programs. Total Medicaid program business accounted for 13.8%, 12.3% and 12.5% of our medical members at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.•FEP members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. FEP business accounted for 4.1%, 4.3% and 4.2% of our medical members at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two principal funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some self-funded customers choose to purchase stop-loss coverage to limit their retained risk.-51-The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. Also included below is other membership by product. The medical membership and other membership presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

The increase was further attributable to growth in our National Accounts and BlueCard® membership.-52-Fully-insured membership decreased 660, or 4.3%, primarily due to the New York State contract conversion and Local Group membership losses as a result of affordability challenges affecting healthcare consumers. The decrease was partially offset by growth in our Medicaid business.Local Group membership increased 412, or 2.8%, primarily due to the acquisition of a large ASO state contract. This increase was partially offset by fully-insured membership declines resulting from affordability challenges affecting healthcare consumers.Individual membership increased 38, or 2.2%, primarily due to public exchange sales in the majority of our markets, partially offset by off-exchange lapses.National Accounts membership increased 378, or 5.6%, primarily due to new sales and in-group change partially offset by lapses.BlueCard® membership increased 229, or 4.5%, primarily due to favorable membership activity at other BCBSA plans whose members reside in or travel to our licensed areas.Medicare membership decreased 37, or 2.6%, primarily due to our product repositioning strategy toward HMO product offerings and select service area reductions.Medicaid membership increased 815, or 18.6%, primarily due to market expansions and commencement of operations in new markets.FEP membership increased 11, or 0.7%, primarily due to favorable open enrollment.Other Membership (in thousands)Our Other products are often ancillary to our health business and can therefore be impacted by corresponding changes in our medical membership.Life and disability membership decreased 57, or 1.2%, primarily due to higher lapses and in-group change in our Local Group and Individual businesses.Dental membership increased 100, or 2.0%, primarily due to new sales and growth in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses.Dental administration membership increased 32, or 0.7%, primarily due to membership expansion under current contracts.Vision membership increased 353, or 7.4%, primarily due to strong sales and in-group change in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses.Medicare Advantage Part D membership increased 62, or 9.9%, primarily due to the addition of a new state contract, partially offset by decreases in various markets due to our product repositioning strategy toward HMO product offerings and select service area reductions.Medicare Part D standalone membership decreased 7, or 1.5%, primarily due to competitive pressure in certain markets.December 31, 2013 Compared to December 31, 2012 Medical Membership (in thousands)During the year ended December 31, 2013, total medical membership decreased 477, or 1.3%, primarily due to decreases in our National Accounts, Medicaid, Medicare and Individual membership.Self-funded medical membership increased 118, or 0.6%, primarily due to increases in our Local Group self-funded accounts, partially offset by lapses in our National Accounts and BlueCard® business.-53-Fully-insured membership decreased 595, or 3.7%, primarily due to membership losses in certain Local Group and Individual markets, as well as membership losses in our Medicaid and Medicare business, described below.Local Group membership increased 44, or 0.3%, primarily due to new sales in several markets, partially offset by insured membership losses from strategic product portfolio changes in certain states, competitive pressure in certain markets and, we believe, affordability challenges affecting healthcare consumers in general.Individual membership decreased 100, or 5.4%, primarily due to a heightened competitive environment in certain markets.National Accounts membership decreased 223, or 3.2%, primarily due to lapses in our self-funded business.BlueCard® membership increased 34, or 0.7%, primarily due to favorable membership activity at other BCBSA plans whose members reside in or travel to our licensed areas.Medicare membership decreased 97, or 6.3%, primarily due to our product repositioning strategy toward HMO product offerings.Medicaid membership decreased 142, or 3.1%, primarily due to membership losses in our California and New York plans and termination of the Ohio contract on June 30, 2013, partially offset by an increase in membership in various other states. FEP membership increased 7, or 0.5%, primarily due to favorable in-group change. Other Membership (in thousands)Our Other products are often ancillary to our health business and can therefore be impacted by corresponding changes in our medical membership.Life and disability membership decreased 19, or 0.4%, primarily due to the overall declines in our Commercial and Specialty Business medical membership. Life and disability products are generally offered as part of Commercial and Specialty Business medical membership sales.Dental membership increased 32, or 0.7%, primarily due to growth from the launch of new product offerings, partially offset by declines in our Commercial and Specialty Business membership.Dental administration membership increased 783, or 19.1%, primarily due to the acquisition of a large managed dental contract pursuant to which we provide dental administrative services.Vision membership increased 224, or 5.0%, primarily due to strong sales and in-group change in our Local Group business.Medicare Advantage Part D membership decreased 106, or 14.4%, primarily due to our product repositioning strategy toward HMO product offerings.Medicare Part D standalone membership decreased 100, or 17.4%, primarily due to competitive pressure in certain markets.Cost of CareThe following discussion summarizes our aggregate underlying cost of care trends for the year ended December 31, 2014 for our Local Group fully-insured business only.Our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing the year-over-year change in average per member per month claim costs, excluding member co-payments and deductibles. While our cost of care trend varies by geographic location, based on underlying medical cost trends, we estimate that our aggregate cost of care trend was approximately 6.5% for the full year of 2014. We anticipate that medical cost trends will increase by approximately 50 basis points in 2015.-54-Provider rate increases were a primary driver of medical cost trends in 2014, consistent with 2013, and we continually negotiate with hospitals and physicians to manage these cost trends. We remain committed to optimizing our reimbursement rates and strategies to help address the cost pressures faced by employers and consumers. Unit cost increases were also a driver of pharmacy cost. In recent years many large volume brand drugs have launched generic alternatives, which have helped to mitigate pharmacy cost trend, but in 2014 we experienced a return to more normal historical average trends. New high cost Hepatitis C drug therapies also have put upward pressure on pharmacy trend.Medical utilization, including pharmacy utilization, has been lower than in previous years and was not a primary driver of increased costs for the year ended December 31, 2014.In response to cost trends, we continue to pursue contracting and plan design changes, promote and implement performance-based contracts that reward clinical outcomes and quality, and expand our disease management and advanced care management programs. We are taking a leadership role in the area of payment reform as evidenced by our Enhanced Personal Health Care program. By establishing the primary care doctor as central to the coordination of a patient’s health care needs, the initiative builds on the success of current patient-centered medical home programs in helping to improve patient care while lowering costs.A number of clinical management initiatives are in place to help mitigate inpatient trend. Focused review efforts continue in key areas, including targeting outlier facilities for length of stay and readmission, and high risk maternity and neonatal intensive care unit cases, among others. Additionally, we continue to refine our programs related to readmission management, focused behavioral health readmission reduction and post-discharge follow-up care.Outpatient costs are a collection of different types of expenses, such as outpatient facilities, labs, x-rays, emergency room, occupational and physical therapy and many others. Two key examples developed to mitigate outpatient costs are as follows:•Cancer Care Quality Program: This program, developed in collaboration with our subsidiary, AIM Specialty Health, or AIM, identifies certain cancer treatment pathways selected based upon current medical evidence, peer-reviewed published literature, consensus guidelines and our clinical policies to support oncologists in identifying cancer treatment therapies that are highly effective and provide greater value.•Expanded Cost and Quality Surgery Program: This program, developed in collaboration with AIM, proactively contacts members who have elected to have an endoscopy, colonoscopy, or knee or shoulder arthroscopy to inform them about alternative sites of care, with the goal of offering information about providers who may be more cost effective.-55-Consolidated Results of OperationsOur consolidated summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are discussed in the following section.

Premiums for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $68,389.8, $66,119.1 and $56,496.7, respectively. Premiums are included in total operating revenue presented above.5bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%.6Selling, general and administrative expense ratio represents selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total operating revenue.-56-Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Total operating revenue increased $2,830.3, or 4.0%, to $73,021.7 in 2014, resulting primarily from higher premiums and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees. Higher premiums were mainly due to rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and new fees associated with Health Care Reform, including HIP Fees reimbursed by Medicaid state plans. The increase in premiums was further attributable to membership increases in our Medicaid and Individual businesses. The increase in premiums was offset, in part, by fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business as a result of the New York State contract conversion and affordability challenges affecting healthcare consumers. The increase was further offset by higher experience rated refunds in our Medicaid business, and lower premiums in our Medicare Advantage business primarily due to membership declines and a refinement of estimates associated with Medicare risk score revenue for prior years. The increase in administrative fees primarily resulted from membership growth in our Local Group business, including the New York State contract conversion and the acquisition of a large state ASO contract, which both occurred in the first quarter of 2014. The increase in administrative fees was further attributable to growth in our National Accounts business. Net investment income increased $65.3, or 9.9%, to $724.4 in 2014, primarily due to higher income from alternative investments and higher investment yields. Net realized gains on investments decreased $94.9, or 34.9%, to $177.0 in 2014, primarily due to a decrease in net realized gains on sales of equity securities, partially offset by an increase in net realized gains on sales of fixed maturity securities.Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments decreased $49.9, or 50.5%, to $49.0 in 2014, primarily due to a decrease in impairment losses on certain joint venture investments and fixed maturity securities.Benefit expense increased $617.8, or 1.1%, to $56,854.9 in 2014, primarily due to benefit cost trends across our businesses and membership growth in our Medicaid and Individual businesses. The increase in benefit expense was further a result of higher pharmacy costs primarily attributable to new high cost Hepatitis C drug therapies. These increases were partially offset by the fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group and Medicare Advantage businesses, as described above. In addition, the increase in benefit expense was offset, in part, by our estimate of reinsurance recoveries relating to the Health Care Reform reinsurance premium stabilization program of $753.4 for 2014.Our benefit expense ratio decreased 200 basis points to 83.1% in 2014, primarily due to rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and new fees associated with Health Care Reform, including additional premiums collected to help cover the non-tax deductible impact of the HIP Fee. The decrease was further attributable to better than expected medical cost trends in our Medicaid business. These improvements were partially offset by higher pharmacy costs primarily attributable to new high cost Hepatitis C drug therapies.Selling, general and administrative expense increased $1,795.5, or 18.0%, to $11,748.4 in 2014. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio increased 190 basis points to 16.1% in 2014. The increases in the expense and ratio were both primarily due to new fees related to Health Care Reform that were effective January 1, 2014, including $893.3 for the HIP Fee and $447.7 of assessments related to the Health Care Reform reinsurance premium stabilization program. Other expenses decreased $90.6, or 9.1%, to $902.7 in 2014, primarily due to lower losses recognized on debt extinguishment associated with the early redemption and repurchase of outstanding senior unsecured notes. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized losses on extinguishment of debt of $81.1 and $145.3, respectively. The decrease in other expense was further attributable to reduced amortization of certain other intangible assets acquired in prior years. For additional information related to our borrowings, see ""Liquidity and Capital Resources - Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity,"" below. Income tax expense increased $602.1, or 49.9%, to $1,808.0 in 2014. The effective tax rates in 2014 and 2013 were 41.4% and 31.4%, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the non-tax deductible HIP Fee effective for 2014 and increased income before income taxes. The 2013 expense and effective tax rate were lower because they include benefits resulting from a favorable tax election made subsequent to the Amerigroup acquisition and from inclusion of Amerigroup in our state apportionment factors calculation, which produces a lower state tax expense. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2014 was primarily due to the non-tax deductible HIP fee.-57-Our net income as a percentage of total revenue was 3.5% in 2014 and 2013 as a result of all factors discussed above.Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Total operating revenue increased $9,677.4, or 16.0% to $70,191.4 in 2013, resulting primarily from higher premiums and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees. The higher premiums were mainly due to increases in our Medicaid business primarily as a result of our acquisition of Amerigroup in December 2012. Rate increases in our Local Group, FEP, Individual and National businesses designed to cover overall cost trends as well as premium rate and membership increases in our Specialty businesses and increased administrative fees resulting from pricing increases for self-funded members in our Commercial businesses also contributed to the increased operating revenue. These increases were partially offset by fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business due to strategic portfolio changes in certain states, competitive pressure in certain markets and, we believe, affordability challenges affecting healthcare consumers in general. Additionally, lower revenues in our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D businesses, primarily due to membership declines as a result of our product repositioning strategy toward HMO product offerings, partially offset the increased operating revenues.Net investment income decreased $27.0, or 3.9%, to $659.1 in 2013, primarily due to lower investment yields.Net realized gains on investments decreased $63.0, or 18.8%, to $271.9 in 2013, primarily due to lower net realized gains on sales of fixed maturity securities partially offset by an increase in net realized gains on sales of equity securities, a realized gain on the partial divestiture of an equity method investment and an increase in net realized gains on sales and settlements of derivative financial instruments.Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments increased $61.1, or 161.6%, to $98.9 in 2013, primarily due to the impairment of certain joint venture investments and fixed maturity securities.Benefit expense increased $8,023.5, or 16.6%, to $56,237.1 in 2013, primarily from our acquisition of Amerigroup and increased benefit costs in our Local Group, Individual and FEP businesses. These increases were partially offset by the fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group and Medicare Advantage businesses as described above.Our benefit expense ratio decreased 20 basis points to 85.1% in 2013, due, in part, to our product repositioning strategy in certain Medicare Advantage plans toward HMO product offerings with lower benefit costs. The decrease was further attributable to the favorable impact of declines in membership in our Local Group business in products with higher benefit costs and lower than expected medical cost trends. These improvements were partially offset by the acquisition of Amerigroup, which carries higher average benefit expense ratios than our consolidated average as well as higher than expected medical cost trends in our Individual business.Selling, general and administrative expense increased $1,272.4, or 14.7%, to $9,952.9 in 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of selling, general and administrative expense related to our Amerigroup subsidiary in 2013. The increase was further attributable to costs incurred in preparation for the implementation of Health Care Reform effective in 2014 as well as increases in incentive compensation as a result of our operating performance.Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 10 basis points to 14.2% in 2013, primarily due to the effect of the increase in operating revenue from Amerigroup partially offset by the increased selling general and administrative expense discussed in the preceding paragraph.Other expense increased $248.5, or 33.4%, to $993.3 in 2013, primarily due to losses recognized on debt extinguishment associated with our early redemption and repurchases of $1,100.0 aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior unsecured notes. The increase in other expense was further attributable to increased interest expense resulting from higher outstanding debt balances associated with our acquisition of Amerigroup and the issuance on July 30, 2013 of $650.0 of 2.300% notes due 2018 and $600.0 of 5.100% notes due 2044 to fund, in part, the early redemption and repurchases discussed above. For additional information related to our borrowings, see ""Liquidity and Capital Resources - Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity,"" below. Income tax expense decreased $1.4, or 0.1%, to $1,205.9 in 2013. The effective tax rates in 2013 and 2012 were 31.4% and 31.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2013 included benefits resulting from a favorable tax election made subsequent to the Amerigroup acquisition and inclusion of Amerigroup in our state apportionment factors calculation, which -58-produced a lower effective state tax rate. The effective tax rate in 2012 included benefits resulting from settlement with the IRS of items related to not-for-profit conversions and corporate reorganizations prior to 2012, as well as issues related to certain of our acquired companies incurred prior to our acquisition of those companies. These favorable items in the 2012 effective tax rate were partially offset by increases due to the impact of non-tax deductible litigation settlement expenses and an increase in our state deferred tax asset valuation allowance attributable to uncertainty associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards.In December 2013, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our 1-800 CONTACTS business and an asset purchase agreement to sell our glasses.com related assets (collectively, 1-800 CONTACTS). The operating results for 1-800 CONTACTS are reported as discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $144.6 compared to income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $4.5 for the year ended December 31, 2012. Included in the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013, is a loss on disposal of held for sale assets, net of tax, of $164.5. The loss on disposal was calculated as the difference between the fair value, as determined by the sales agreements less costs to sell, and the carrying value of the held for sale assets at December 31, 2013. The divestitures were completed on January 31, 2014 and did not result in any material difference to the loss on disposal recognized during the year ended December 31, 2013.Our net income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 80 basis points to 3.5% in 2013 as compared to 2012 as a result of all factors discussed above. Reportable Segments Results of OperationsWe use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, which are Commercial and Specialty Business; Government Business; and Other. Operating gain, which is a non-GAAP measure, is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense and selling, general and administrative expense. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains/losses on investments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, loss on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Effective January 1, 2014, our Employer Group Medicare Advantage members are being reported within Local Group and National Accounts in our Commercial and Specialty Business segment and prior period segment amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. These members were previously reported with our Medicare membership within our Government Business segment. The Employer Group Medicare Advantage members are retired members who have selected a Medicare Advantage product through our Local Group and National Accounts.The discussion of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional information, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, see Note 19, “Segment Information,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.-59-Our Commercial and Specialty Business, Government Business, and Other segments’ summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows: Change Years Ended December 31 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 2014 2013 2012 $ % $ %Commercial and Specialty Business Operating revenue$39,199.6 $39,404.2 $39,639.9 $(204.6) (0.5)% $(235.7) (0.6)%Operating gain$3,260.9 $3,176.4 $3,396.3 $84.5 2.7 % $(219.9) (6.5)%Operating margin8.3% 8.1% 8.6% 20bp (50)bpGovernment Business Operating revenue$33,796.4 $30,752.6 $20,838.9 $3,043.8 9.9 % $9,913.7 47.6 %Operating gain$1,191.9 $844.0 $285.4 $347.9 41.2 % $558.6 195.7 %Operating margin3.5% 2.7% 1.4% 80bp 130bpOther Operating revenue1$25.7 $34.6 $35.2 $(8.9) (25.7)% $(0.6) (1.7)%Operating loss2$(34.4) $(19.0) $(61.8) $(15.4) 81.1 % $42.8 (69.3)% 1 Fluctuations not material.2 Fluctuations primarily a result of changes in unallocated corporate expenses.Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Commercial and Specialty BusinessOperating revenue decreased $204.6, or 0.5%, to $39,199.6 in 2014, primarily due to fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business resulting from the impact of the New York State contract conversion and affordability challenges affecting healthcare consumers. These decreases were partially offset by premium rate increases in our Local Group and Individual businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and new fees associated with Health Care Reform, and membership growth in our Individual business. The decrease in operating revenue was further offset by increased administrative fees primarily resulting from membership growth in our Local Group business, including the acquisition of a large state ASO contract in the first quarter of 2014. The increase in administrative fees was further attributable to growth in our National Accounts business. Operating gain increased $84.5, or 2.7%, to $3,260.9 in 2014, primarily as a result of improved performance in our Individual business reflecting our public exchange strategy implemented during the year, along with membership growth in self-funded products. The increase in operating gain was further attributable to additional premiums collected to help cover the non-tax deductible impact of the HIP Fee. These increases were partially offset by insured membership declines in our Local Group business, continued costs incurred associated with Health Care Reform market changes and higher pharmacy costs primarily attributable to new high cost Hepatitis C drug therapies.The operating margin in 2014 was 8.3%, a 20 basis point increase over 2013, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.Government BusinessOperating revenue increased $3,043.8, or 9.9%, to $33,796.4 in 2014, primarily due to increased premiums in our Medicaid and FEP businesses as a result of premium rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends and new fees associated with Health Care Reform. The increase in operating revenue was further attributable to membership growth in our Medicaid business and additional premiums collected to help cover the non-tax deductible impact of the HIP Fee. These increases were partially offset by higher experience rated refunds in our Medicaid business, lower premiums in our Medicare -60-businesses, primarily due to membership declines in our Medicare Advantage business, and a refinement of estimates associated with Medicare risk score revenue for prior years. Operating gain increased $347.9, or 41.2%, to $1,191.9 in 2014, primarily due to better than expected medical cost trends and membership growth in our Medicaid business. These increases were partially offset by higher pharmacy costs primarily attributable to new high cost Hepatitis C drug therapies, and a refinement of estimates associated with Medicare risk score revenue for prior years.The operating margin in 2014 was 3.5%, a 80 basis point increase over 2013, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Commercial and Specialty BusinessOperating revenue decreased $235.7, or 0.6%, to $39,404.2 in 2013, primarily due to fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business resulting from strategic product portfolio changes in certain states, competitive pressure in certain markets and, we believe, affordability challenges affecting healthcare consumers in general. This decrease was partially offset by premium rate increases in our Local Group, Individual and National businesses designed to cover overall cost trends, premium rate and membership increases in our Specialty businesses, primarily related to our dental and vision products, as well as increased administrative fees resulting from pricing increases for self-funded members in our Commercial businesses.Operating gain decreased $219.9, or 6.5%, to $3,176.4 in 2013, primarily as a result of higher selling, general and administrative expenses driven by costs incurred in preparation for the implementation of Health Care Reform provisions that become effective in 2014 as well as increases in allocated incentive compensation as a result of consolidated operating performance. The decrease was further attributable to increased benefit costs in our Individual business. These decreases were partially offset by improved results in our Local Group business resulting from lower than anticipated medical cost trends.The operating margin in 2013 was 8.1%, a 50 basis point decrease from 2012, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Government BusinessOperating revenue increased $9,913.7, or 47.6%, to $30,752.6 in 2013, primarily due to the acquisition of Amerigroup, growth in our FEP business due to premium rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends, and increases in membership in our CareMore and FEP businesses. These increases were partially offset by membership declines in our non-CareMore Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D businesses related to our product repositioning strategy toward HMO product offerings.Operating gain increased $558.6, or 195.7%, to $844.0 in 2013, primarily due to the acquisition of Amerigroup and improved operating results in the majority of our other government lines of business.The operating margin in 2013 was 2.7%, a 130 basis point increase over 2012, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider our most important accounting policies that require significant estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our other significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.-61-We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances.Medical Claims Payable The most subjective accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2014, this liability was $6,861.2 and represented 18.1% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 95.8%, or $6,572.4, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2014; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 4.2%, or $288.8, of the total medical claims payable as of December 31, 2014. The level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period end to the next, from approximately 1% to 5% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made.Liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be appropriate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or “trend factors.”Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison of prior year, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense.We regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable.-62-While there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid claims liability as of December 31, 2014 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by other operational variables including system changes, provider submission patterns and business combinations.There is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through twelve months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. In our analysis for the claim liabilities at December 31, 2014, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 40 and 90 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower variability ranging from 0 to 30 basis points.The difference in completion factor assumptions, assuming moderately adverse experience, results in variability of 2%, or approximately $155.0, in the December 31, 2014 incurred but not paid claims liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein.The other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2014 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. In our analysis for the period ended December 31, 2014, there was a 330 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors assuming moderately adverse experience. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 4%, or approximately $303.0, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factors used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claims liability at December 31, 2014. See Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year.” Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. The ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 89.4% for 2014, 89.3% for 2013 and 89.1% for 2012. The increase in these ratios reflects acceleration in processing claims that occurred over the course of the past three years.We calculate the percentage of prior years’ redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior years' net incurred claims payable less prior years’ redundancies in the current year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior years’ reserves. This metric was 9.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014, 10.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2012. The year ended December 31, 2014 metric reflects a slightly higher level of accuracy compared to the targeted prior year reserve for adverse deviation and a resultant lower level of prior years' redundancies than the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.We calculate the percentage of prior years’ redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior years’ net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation supports the reasonableness of our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims and the consistency in our methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2014, this metric was 1.0%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $541.9. This metric was 1.3% for 2013 and 1.1% for 2012.-63-The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for each of 2013 and 2012 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims – current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims – prior years redundancies” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 2013 2012Total net incurred medical claims, as reported$55,295.2 $47,566.5Retrospective basis, as described above55,352.4 47,481.0Variance$(57.2) $85.5Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported(0.1)% 0.2%Given that our business is primarily short tailed (which means that medical claims are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider), the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2014 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2015.The 2013 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of (0.1)% was smaller in absolute value than the 2012 percentage of 0.2%. The lower 2013 variance was driven by a more consistent level of prior year redundancies in 2014 and 2013 associated with 2013 and 2012 claim payments, respectively. Prior year redundancies in 2012 associated with 2011 claim payments were slightly lower by comparison, thus creating a higher 2012 variance.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes in accordance with FASB guidance, which requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance.At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following:•the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset;•the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim;•the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and•any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences.We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits, as required by the guidance. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted.In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we intend to defend our positions vigorously through the federal, state and local appeals processes. We believe we have adequately -64-provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact on our results of operations from these matters.For additional information, see Note 7, “Income Taxes,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsOur consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2014 was $17,082.0 and other intangible assets were $7,958.1. The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets represented 40.3% of our total consolidated assets and 103.3% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2014.We follow FASB guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, which include goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately.We complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. These tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Certain interim impairment tests are also performed when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur.Fair value is estimated using the income and market approaches for goodwill at the reporting unit level and the income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. Use of the income and market approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. The income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. These estimated future cash flows are then discounted. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted-average cost of capital. Market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including membership, revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry.We did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2014 annual impairment tests as the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying values as of December 31, 2014. Additionally, we do not believe that the estimated fair values of our reporting units are at risk of becoming impaired in the next twelve months. However, as a result of certain provisions of Health Care Reform, along with current economic conditions, we have experienced lower operating margins in certain lines of business. Those margins could become further compressed if results from implementation of Health Care Reform are significantly different than anticipated. As a result, the estimated fair values of certain of our reporting units with goodwill could fall below their carrying values in future periods and if that were to occur, we would be required to record impairment losses at that time.While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.For additional information, see Note 3, ""Business Acquisitions and Divestitures"" and Note 9, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. -65-Investments Current and long-term available-for-sale investment securities were $19,909.9 at December 31, 2014 and represented 32.1% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2014. We classify fixed maturity and equity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” or “trading” and report those securities at fair value. Certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity.We review investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. In addition, for equity securities, we determine whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time to allow for a recovery of its fair value above its carrying amount. If any declines of equity securities are determined to be other-than-temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made.Certain FASB other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, guidance applies to fixed maturity securities and provides guidance on the recognition, presentation of, and disclosures for OTTIs. If a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and is presented within the Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income line item on our consolidated statements of income. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, the credit component of the OTTI is presented within the Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income line item on our consolidated statements of income and the non-credit component of the OTTI is recognized in other comprehensive income. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The credit component of an OTTI is determined by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of acquisition. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other debt securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings, and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default.We have a committee of accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. The current economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets.We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. This could result in other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments being charged against future income. Given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional, material other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments may be recorded in future periods.In addition to available-for-sale investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $1,695.9, or 2.7% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2014. These long-term investments consisted primarily of certain other equity -66-investments, cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and real estate. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term.Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage the market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits on investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future earnings and financial position. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $17,971.8 at December 31, 2014. The weighted-average credit rating of these securities was “A” as of December 31, 2014. Included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions and mortgage-backed securities of $1,403.7 and $7.4, respectively, that are guaranteed by third parties. With the exception of twelve securities with a fair value of $7.7, these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2014. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities without a guarantee was “A” as of December 31, 2014 for the securities for which such information is available.Fair values of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with FASB guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. We have controls in place to review the pricing services’ qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. In addition, we periodically review the pricing services’ pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable.We obtain only one quoted price for each security from the pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform monthly analysis on the prices received from the pricing services to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes a review of month-to-month price fluctuations. If unusual fluctuations are noted in this review, we may obtain additional information from other pricing services to validate the quoted price. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from the pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.In certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. Such securities are designated Level III in accordance with FASB guidance. Securities designated Level III at December 31, 2014 totaled $202.8 and represented less than 1% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level III securities primarily consisted of certain corporate securities, equity securities and structured securities for which observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using internal estimates for inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields.For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”, and Part II, Item 8, Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” Note 4, “Investments,” and Note 6, “Fair Value,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Retirement Benefits Pension BenefitsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for some of our employees. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FASB guidance for retirement benefits, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by the guidance, we calculate the value of plan assets as described below. Further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods. -67-An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our December 31, 2014 measurement date, we selected a weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.62%. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and an average of historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase.This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. We apply a corridor approach to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. Under this approach, only accumulated net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the average remaining service or lifetime of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date. At the December 31, 2014 measurement date, the selected weighted-average discount rate was 3.66%, compared to 4.39% at the December 31, 2013 measurement date. We developed this rate using a yield curve approach. Using yields available on high-quality fixed maturity securities with various maturity dates, the yield curve approach provides a “customized” rate, which is meant to match the expected cash flows of our specific benefit plans. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FASB guidance.In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities, equity securities and alternative investments across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow.Other Postretirement BenefitsWe provide most associates with certain medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits.At our December 31, 2014 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 3.74%, compared to a discount rate of 4.48% at the December 31, 2013 measurement date. We developed this rate using a yield curve approach as described above.The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of pre-Medicare (those who are not currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2014 measurement date was 8.00% for 2015 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2025. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of post-Medicare (those who are currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2014 measurement date was 6.00% for 2015 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2021. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014 by $56.7 and would increase service and interest costs by $2.0. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by $47.6 as of December 31, 2014 and would decrease service and interest costs by $1.8.For additional information regarding our retirement benefits, see Note 10, “Retirement Benefits,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.-68-New Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended December 31, 2014 that had, or are expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures, see the “Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance” and ""Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted"" sections of Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesIntroductionOur cash receipts result primarily from premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity.We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy.A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations.The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. The securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility, although current market conditions are more stable. During recent years, the federal government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to restore liquidity in the financial markets and to help relieve the credit crisis and strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. In addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide liquidity and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions. We have a $2,500.0 commercial paper program. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we have the ability to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our $2,000.0 senior revolving credit facility to redeem any outstanding commercial paper upon maturity. Additionally, we believe the lenders participating in our credit facility would be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. In addition to the $2,000.0 senior revolving credit facility, we estimate that we will receive approximately $2,100.0 of dividends from our subsidiaries during 2015, which also provides further operating and financial flexibility. -69-The table below outlines the cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31 2014 2013 2012Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities$3,369.3 $3,052.3 $2,744.6Investing activities(974.9) (2,234.4) (4,551.6)Financing activities(1,822.5) (1,717.8) 2,088.9Effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(7.1) 2.2 1.1Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$564.8 $(897.7) $283.0Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 During the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $3,369.3, compared to $3,052.3 for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $317.0. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in premium receipts as a result of rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and new fees associated with Health Care Reform and an increase in administrative fee receipts primarily as a result of growth in membership. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was offset, in part, by payments for new fees associated with Health Care Reform, including the HIP Fee and assessments related to the Health Care Reform reinsurance premium stabilization program. The increase was further offset by an increase in claims payments primarily as a result of membership growth, an increase in personnel service costs and an increase in income taxes paid.Net cash flow used in investing activities was $974.9 during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $2,234.4 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in cash flow used in investing activities of $1,259.5 primarily resulted from cash provided by the sale of our 1-800 CONTACTS business and glasses.com related assets on January 31, 2014 and a decrease in net purchases of investments, partially offset by changes in securities lending collateral.Net cash flow used in financing activities was $1,822.5 during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $1,717.8 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in cash flow used in financing activities of $104.7 primarily resulted from an increase in common stock repurchases, a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans and an increase in net repayments of commercial paper borrowings. These increases in net cash used in financing activities were partially offset by changes in short- and long-term borrowings as a result of net proceeds received from long-term borrowings during 2014 compared to net repayments of short- and long-term borrowings during 2013. In addition, the increase in net cash flow used in financing activities was partially offset by changes in bank overdrafts and changes in securities lending payable.Liquidity— Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 During the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $3,052.3, compared to $2,744.6 for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $307.7. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items, primarily due to the loss on disposal of discontinued operations, changes in amortization expense and realized losses on extinguishment of debt. The increase was further attributable to an increase in net cash flow provided by Amerigroup as 2012 included post-acquisition change-in-control payments and transaction costs that did not recur in 2013. Additionally, the increase was due to a net increase in the collection of income tax refunds in 2013.Net cash flow used in investing activities was $2,234.4 during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $4,551.6 for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in cash flow used in investing activities of $2,317.2 primarily resulted from a decrease in cash used for the purchase of subsidiaries, as net cash used in investing activities for 2012 included the acquisitions of Amerigroup and 1-800 CONTACTS, while there were no purchases of subsidiaries in 2013. This decrease was partially offset by the net change in investment activity and changes in securities lending collateral.Net cash flow used in financing activities was $1,717.8 during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to net cash flow provided by financing activities of $2,088.9 for the year ended December 31, 2012. The change in cash flow from -70-financing activities of $3,806.7 primarily resulted from an increase in long-term borrowings in 2012 primarily used to fund the acquisition of Amerigroup compared to an increase in net repayments of long-term borrowings in 2013. The change in cash flow from financing activity was further attributable to a decrease in common stock repurchases, changes in securities lending payable, and an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. Financial Condition We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, of $23,777.7 at December 31, 2014. Since December 31, 2013, total cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, increased by $1,381.8 primarily due to to cash generated from operations, net proceeds received from long-term borrowings, proceeds from the sale of our 1-800-CONTACTS business, changes in securities lending payable and proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. These increases were partially offset by common stock repurchases, purchases of property and equipment, changes in securities lending collateral, cash dividends paid to shareholders and net repayments of commercial paper borrowings.Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Certain accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities, or statutory accounting practices, differ from GAAP. Changes that occur in statutory accounting practices, if any, could impact our subsidiaries' future dividend capacity. In addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries.At December 31, 2014, we held $2,699.9 of cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company, which are available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, potential future common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders, repurchases of debt securities and debt and interest payments. We calculate our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, a non-GAAP measure, which we believe assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. In addition, our bank covenants include a maximum debt-to-capital ratio that we cannot and did not exceed. Our debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt plus shareholders’ equity. Our debt-to-capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio was 38.5% and 36.9% as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our senior debt is rated “A-” by Standard & Poor’s, “BBB+” by Fitch, Inc., “Baa2” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. A significant downgrade in our debt ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs.Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity On February 17, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Simply Healthcare using a combination of cash and commercial paper borrowings.We have a shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries and the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion.We have a senior credit facility, or the facility, with certain lenders for general corporate purposes. The facility, as amended, provides credit up to $2,000.0 and matures on September 29, 2016. The interest rate on the facility is based on either (i) the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined percentage rate based on our credit rating at the date of utilization, or (ii) a base rate as defined in the facility agreement plus a predetermined percentage rate based on our credit rating at the date of utilization. Our ability to borrow under the facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. There were no amounts outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2014.-71-We have an authorized commercial paper program of up to $2,500.0, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. We did not have any borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2013, we had $379.2 outstanding under our commercial paper program. Commercial paper borrowings have been classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2013 as our general practice and intent is to replace short-term commercial paper outstanding at expiration with additional short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one year and we have the ability to redeem our commercial paper with borrowings under the senior credit facility described above. We resumed borrowing under our commercial paper program in the first quarter of 2015. We are a member, through certain subsidiaries, of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, collectively, the FHLBs, and as a member we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, $400.0 was outstanding under our short-term FHLBs borrowings.On September 15, 2014, we redeemed the $500.0 outstanding principal balance of our 5.000% senior unsecured notes due 2014, plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, for cash totaling $512.3. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.3 for the redemption of these notes.On September 11, 2014, we redeemed the $1,097.9 outstanding principal balance of our 5.250% senior unsecured notes due 2016, plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, for cash totaling $1,178.2. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $67.6 for the redemption of these notes.Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we repurchased $52.0 of outstanding principal amount of certain other senior unsecured notes, plus applicable premium for early redemption plus accrued and unpaid interest, for cash totaling $61.0. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.2 for the year ended December 31, 2014 for the repurchase of these notes.On August 12, 2014, we issued $850.0 of 2.250% notes due 2019, $800.0 of 3.500% notes due 2024, $800.0 of 4.650% notes due 2044, and $250.0 of 4.850% notes due 2054 under our shelf registration statement. We used the proceeds from this offering in part to fund the purchase price of the 5.000% and 5.250% senior unsecured notes discussed above, and the remaining net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2015. The notes have a call feature that allows us to repurchase the notes at any time at our option and a put feature that allows a note holder to require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the notes below an investment grade rating. On September 5, 2013, we redeemed the $400.0 outstanding principal balance of our 6.000% senior unsecured notes due 2014, plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, for cash totaling $411.0. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $10.0 for the redemption of these notes.On July 30, 2013, we initiated a cash tender offer and consent solicitation to purchase up to $300.0 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5.875% notes due 2017 and 7.000% notes due 2019 (the “First Tranche Offer”) and to purchase up to $300.0 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5.950% notes due 2034, 5.850% notes due 2036, 6.375% notes due 2037 and 5.800% notes due 2040 (the “Second Tranche Offer”), collectively, the “Tender Offers”. The Tender Offers were each subject to increase up to an additional $100.0 at our election. On August 12, 2013, we increased the Second Tranche Offer to $400.0 and on August 13, 2013 we repurchased $300.0 of the First Tranche Offer notes and $400.0 of the Second Tranche Offer notes for cash totaling $837.7. Holders who tendered their notes prior to the early tender date received the principal amounts, applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the early tender offer settlement date. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $135.3 for the repurchase of these notes.On July 30, 2013, we issued $650.0 of 2.300% notes due 2018 and $600.0 of 5.100% notes due 2044 under our shelf registration statement. We used the proceeds from this offering in part to fund the purchase price of the 6.000% senior unsecured notes and the Tender Offers discussed above, and the balance for general corporate purposes. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2014. The notes have a call feature that allows us to repurchase the notes at any time at our option and a put feature that allows a note holder to require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the notes below an investment grade rating.-72-On January 25, 2013, we redeemed the outstanding principal balance of $475.0 of 7.500% senior unsecured notes due 2019, plus applicable premium for early redemption, for cash totaling $555.6. The weighted-average redemption price of the notes was approximately 117% of the principal amount outstanding.While we generally issue senior unsecured notes for long-term borrowing purposes, on October 9, 2012, we issued $1,500.0 of senior convertible debentures, or the Debentures. The Debentures are governed by an indenture, or the Indenture, dated as of October 9, 2012 between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The Debentures bear interest at a rate of 2.750% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on April 15 and October 15 of each year, and mature on October 15, 2042, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted into shares of common stock at the applicable conversion rate. We used approximately $371.0 of the net proceeds from the issuance to repurchase shares of our common stock concurrently with the offering of the Debentures, and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including but not limited to additional purchases of shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program and the repayment of debt. For additional information related to our borrowing activities and the Debentures, including the circumstances under which holders may convert the Debentures into common stock, see Note 12, “Debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we are currently estimating approximately $2,100.0 of dividends to be paid to the parent company during 2015. During 2014, we received $3,234.5 of dividends from our subsidiaries.We regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including common stock repurchases, repurchases of debt securities and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt securities is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.A summary of the cash dividend activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows:Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date CashDividendper Share TotalJanuary 28, 2014 March 10, 2014 March 25, 2014 $0.4375 $123.4April 29, 2014 June 10, 2014 June 25, 2014 0.4375 120.5July 29, 2014 September 10, 2014 September 25, 2014 0.4375 119.2October 28, 2014 December 5, 2014 December 22, 2014 0.4375 117.6On January 27, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.6250 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on March 25, 2015 to shareholders of record as of March 10, 2015.A summary of common stock repurchases for the period January 1, 2015 through February 5, 2015 (subsequent to December 31, 2014) and for the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows: January 1, 2015ThroughFebruary 5, 2015 Year EndedDecember 31,2014Shares repurchased1.8 30.4Average price per share$131.16 $98.52Aggregate cost$229.9 $2,998.8Authorization remaining at the end of each period$5,461.8 $5,691.7-73-Under the common stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, on February 4, 2014, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a counterparty. The agreement provided for the repurchase of a number of shares, equal to $600.0, as determined by the volume weighted-average price of our shares during the term of the agreement. In March 2014, we repurchased 6.6 shares under the agreement. The shares repurchased under the agreement are included in the amount disclosed above as shares repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2014.On October 2, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a $5,000.0 increase to the common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. The repurchases are effected from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase agreements, and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We expect to utilize the unused authorization remaining at December 31, 2014 over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares under the program when we believe it is a prudent use of capital.Our current retirement benefits funding strategy is to fund an amount at least equal to the minimum required funding as determined under ERISA with consideration of maximum tax deductible amounts. We may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2014, no material contributions were necessary to meet ERISA required funding levels. However, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we made tax deductible discretionary contributions to the pension benefit plans of $3.6.Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2014 are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 YearsDebt1 $25,235.8 $1,231.7 $2,104.2 $3,622.8 $18,277.1Operating lease commitments896.1 148.7 257.1 215.4 274.9Projected other postretirement benefits478.3 63.3 128.7 132.0 154.3Purchase obligations: IBM outsourcing agreements2 475.3 103.3 194.1 177.9 —Other purchase obligations3 2,763.5 1,703.8 915.3 138.2 6.2Other long-term liabilities4 1,036.4 — 469.7 384.7 182.0Investment commitments555.1 213.0 188.8 125.4 27.9Total contractual obligations and commitments$31,440.5 $3,463.8 $4,257.9 $4,796.4 $18,922.4 1Includes estimated interest expense. 2Relates to agreements with International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, to provide information technology infrastructure services. For further information, see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies,” to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.3Includes obligations related to non-IBM information technology service agreements and telecommunication contracts.4Estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from this table as we had no funding requirements under ERISA at December 31, 2014 as a result of the value of the assets in the plans. In addition, amounts include other obligations resulting from third-party service contracts.The above table does not contain $129.9 of gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions and interest for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities. For further information, see Note 7, “Income Taxes,” to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. -74-We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our senior credit facility or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that will require funding in future periods.Risk-Based CapitalOur regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies and health maintenance organizations largely based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under the RBC Model Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our regulated subsidiaries' respective RBC levels as of December 31, 2014, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, were in excess of all mandatory RBC thresholds. In addition to exceeding the RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries.For additional information, see Note 21, “Statutory Information,"" to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein)As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2014. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return.InvestmentsOur investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk.The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit event, such as a ratings downgrade or default, to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that event. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately “A.” Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which have exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value.Our available-for-sale investment portfolio includes corporate securities which account for 41.9% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2014 and are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. We manage this risk through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of our corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately “BBB.”Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systemic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio.As of December 31, 2014, 90.3% of our available-for-sale investments were fixed maturity securities. Market risk is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $777.5 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $607.8 increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly.As of December 31, 2014, 9.7% of our available-for-sale investments were equity securities. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $193.8. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $193.8.-77-For additional information regarding our investments, see Part II, Item 8, Note 4, “Investments”, to our audited consolidated financial statements and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Investments” within Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Long-Term DebtOur total long-term debt at December 31, 2014 was $14,752.2 and includes senior unsecured notes, convertible debentures and subordinated surplus notes by one of our insurance subsidiaries. This debt is subject to interest rate risk as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. The senior unsecured notes had combined carrying and estimated fair value of $13,752.9 and $14,764.6, respectively, at December 31, 2014. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the convertible debentures were $974.4 and $2,581.9, respectively, at December 31, 2014. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the surplus notes were $24.9 and $30.2, respectively, at December 31, 2014.Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. For additional information regarding our long-term debt, see Note 6, ""Fair Value"" and Note 12, “Debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.DerivativesWe have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts, which are used to lock-in interest rates or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. We have used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities.Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these derivatives. As of December 31, 2014, we recorded a net liability of $5.2, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swaps' fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $43.7 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $43.7 increase in fair value.We also utilize put and call options on the S&P 500 index to hedge, on an economic basis, the exposure of our equity security portfolio to fluctuations in the equity markets. While the impact of fluctuations in the equity markets on these derivatives are largely offset by changes in the fair values of our equity security portfolio, the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized immediately in our income statement, whereas the change in fair value of our equity securities is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Accordingly, a decrease in the S&P 500 index of 10% would result in an approximate increase of $27.9 in the fair value of these derivatives. An increase in the S&P 500 index of 10% would result in an approximate decrease of $17.4 in the fair value of these derivatives.For additional information regarding our derivatives, see Note 5, “Derivative Financial Instruments” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein) References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Anthem” or the “Company” refer to Anthem, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and, unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries.This Management's Discussion and Analysis, or MD&A, should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.OverviewWe manage our operations through three reportable segments: Commercial and Specialty Business, Government Business and Other. We regularly evaluate the appropriateness of our reportable segments, particularly in light of organizational changes, merger and acquisition activity and changing laws and regulations. Therefore, these reportable segments may change in the future. Our Commercial and Specialty Business segment includes our Local Group, National Accounts, Individual and Specialty businesses. Business units in the Commercial and Specialty Business segment offer fully-insured health products; provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management, disease management, wellness programs and other administrative services; and provide an array of specialty and other insurance products and services such as dental, vision, life and disability insurance benefits, radiology benefit management and analytics-driven personal health care guidance.Our Government Business segment includes Medicare and Medicaid businesses, National Government Services, or NGS, and services provided to the federal government in connection with the Federal Employee Program, or FEP. Medicare business includes services such as Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and Medicare Supplement. Medicaid business includes our managed care alternatives through publicly funded health care programs, including Medicaid; Temporary Assistance for Needy Family, or TANF, programs; programs for seniors and people with disabilities, or SPD; programs for long-term services and support, or LTSS; Children’s Health Insurance Programs, or CHIP, and Medicaid expansion programs. NGS acts as a Medicare contractor for the federal government in several regions across the nation. Our Other segment includes other businesses that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, guidance, as well as corporate expenses not allocated to the other reportable segments.Our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue comes from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. Administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, or where the fee is based on either processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized. Additionally, we earn administrative fee revenues from our Medicare processing business and from other health-related businesses including disease management programs. Other revenue includes miscellaneous income other than premium revenue and administrative fees.Our benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our fully-insured members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. While we offer a diversified mix of managed care products and services through our managed care plans, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products and services. Our managed care plans include: preferred provider organizations, or PPOs; health maintenance organizations, or HMOs; point-of-service plans, or POS plans; -44-traditional indemnity plans and other hybrid plans, including consumer-driven health plans, or CDHPs; and hospital only and limited benefit products. We classify certain claims-related costs as benefit expense to reflect costs incurred for our members’ traditional medical care, as well as those expenses which improve our members’ health and medical outcomes. These claims-related costs may be comprised of expenses incurred for: (i) medical management, including case and utilization management; (ii) health and wellness, including disease management services for such conditions as diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, congestive heart failure and asthma management and wellness initiatives like weight-loss programs and smoking cessation treatments; and (iii) clinical health policy. These types of claims-related costs are designed to ultimately lower our members’ cost of care. Our selling expense consists of external broker commission expenses, and generally varies with premium or membership volume. Our general and administrative expense consists of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium, but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels, and thus associated compensation expense. Other variable costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity.Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management and health and wellness programs. Several economic factors related to health care costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating health care costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers and any regulatory or market driven restrictions on our ability to obtain adequate premium rates to offset overall inflation in health care costs, including increases in unit costs and utilization resulting from the aging of the population and other demographics, as well as advances in medical technology, may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material impact on our results of operations.On July 24, 2015, we and Cigna Corporation, or Cigna, announced that we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or Merger Agreement, dated as of July 23, 2015, by and among Anthem, Cigna and Anthem Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to which we will acquire all outstanding shares of Cigna, or the Acquisition. The Acquisition will further our goal of creating a premier health benefits company with critical diversification and scale to lead the transformation of health care delivery for consumers. Cigna is a global health services organization that delivers affordable and personalized products and services to customers through employer-based, government-sponsored and individual coverage arrangements. All of Cigna's products and services are provided exclusively by or through its operating subsidiaries, including Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, Cigna Health and Life Insurance Company, Life Insurance Company of North America and Cigna Life Insurance Company of New York. Such products and services include an integrated suite of health services, such as medical, dental, behavioral health, pharmacy, vision, supplemental benefits, and other related products including group life, accident and disability insurance. Cigna maintains sales capability in 30 countries and jurisdictions. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Cigna’s shareholders will receive $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 shares of our common stock for each Cigna common share outstanding. The value of the transaction is estimated to be approximately $53,000.0 based on the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on July 23, 2015. The final purchase price will be determined based on our closing stock price on the date of closing of the Acquisition. The combined company will reflect a pro forma equity ownership comprised of approximately 67% Anthem shareholders and approximately 33% Cigna shareholders. We expect to finance the cash portion of the Acquisition through available cash on hand and the issuance of new debt. We entered into a bridge facility commitment letter and a joinder agreement with a group of lenders which will provide up to $22,500.0 under a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan credit facility to finance the Acquisition in the event that we have not received proceeds from any combination of (i) senior unsecured term loans, (ii) common or preferred equity or equity-linked securities and/or (iii) senior unsecured notes in a public offering or private placement in an aggregate principal amount of at least $22,500.0 prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. In addition, in August 2015, we entered into a term loan facility which will provide up to $4,000.0 to finance a portion of the Acquisition. The commitment of the lenders to provide the bridge facility and the term loan facility is subject to several conditions, -45-including the completion of the Acquisition. We expect that our pro forma debt-to-capital ratio will approximate 49% at the closing of the Acquisition and we are committed to deleveraging to the low 40% range approximately twenty-four months following the closing. We also expect to maintain our common stock dividend and we will maintain flexibility with our share repurchase program.For additional information, see ""Risk Factors"" included in Part I, Item 1A; and Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestiture - Pending Acquisition of Cigna Corporation"" included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On February 17, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Simply Healthcare, a leading managed care company for people enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare programs in Florida. This acquisition aligns with our strategy for continued growth in our Government Business segment. As a result, we serve more than six hundred thousand members in Florida through our affiliated Amerigroup and Simply Healthcare Medicaid and Medicare plans. For additional information see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestiture - Acquisition of Simply Healthcare"" included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On January 31, 2014, we sold our 1-800 CONTACTS, Inc. business and our glasses.com related assets, or collectively, 1-800 CONTACTS. The operating results for 1-800 CONTACTS for the one month ended January 31, 2014 are reported as discontinued operations. These results were previously reported in the Commercial and Specialty Business segment. Unless otherwise specified, all financial and membership information, other than cash flows, disclosed in this MD&A is from continuing operations. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, guidance, we have elected to not separately disclose net cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities and the net effect of those cash flows on cash and cash equivalents for discontinued operations during the periods presented. For additional information regarding these transactions, see Note 3, ""Business Acquisitions and Divestiture - Divestiture of 1-800 CONTACTS,"" included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our future results of operations will also be impacted by certain external forces and resulting changes in our business model and strategy. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, as well as the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, Health Care Reform, became law, causing significant changes to the U.S. health care system. Since then, significant regulations have been enacted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury. The legislation and regulations are far-reaching and are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage over time by mandating that most individuals obtain health insurance coverage, increasing the eligibility thresholds for most state Medicaid programs and providing certain other individuals and small businesses with tax credits to subsidize a portion of the cost of health insurance coverage. As a result of the complexity of the law, its impact on health care in the United States and the continuing modification and interpretation of Health Care Reform rules, we continue to analyze and refine our estimates of the ultimate impact of Health Care Reform on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Health Care Reform presents us with new growth opportunities, but also introduces new risks, regulatory challenges and uncertainties, and required changes in the way products are designed, underwritten, priced, distributed and administered. For additional discussion, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Regulation,” and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Pricing in our Commercial and Specialty Business segment, including our Individual and Small Group lines of business, remains competitive and we strive to price our health care benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends. We believe our pricing strategy, based on predictive modeling, proprietary research and data-driven processes, as well as our overall investments for Health Care Reform, have positioned us to benefit from the potential growth opportunities available in fully-insured commercial products as a result of Health Care Reform. In the Individual and Small Group markets, we offer on-exchange products through state or federally facilitated marketplaces, referred to as public exchanges, and off-exchange products. Federal premium subsidies are available only for certain members who purchase certain public exchange products. The public exchanges have increased the risk that our products will be selected by individuals who have a higher risk profile or utilization rate than the pool of participants we anticipated when we established the pricing for these public exchange products. We believe that our pricing strategy, brand name and network quality will provide a strong foundation for commercial risk membership growth opportunities in the future. In our Individual markets we offer bronze, silver and gold products, both on and off the public exchanges, in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. Additionally, we offer platinum products, both on and off the public exchanges, in California and New York. -46-In our Small Group markets, we offer bronze, silver and gold products, off the public exchanges, in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. We offer bronze, silver and gold products, on the public exchanges, in Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio and Virginia. Additionally, we offer platinum products, off the public exchanges, in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky, Maine, Nevada and Virginia.Private exchanges have gained visibility in the marketplace based on the promise of helping employers reduce costs, increase consumer engagement and manage the complexities created by the ACA and other market forces. While private exchanges have been a distribution channel in the Medicare and Individual markets for some time, the heightened level of activity and investment among the consulting and broker communities and other health insurance carriers has generated an increasing level of interest among employers in the Commercial market. To date, adoption levels have been lower than analyst predictions. While the ultimate volume, pace of growth and winning business models remain highly uncertain, we believe private exchanges will provide opportunities for growth. Health Care Reform also imposes new regulations on the health insurance sector, including, but not limited to, guaranteed coverage and expanded benefit requirements; prohibitions on some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to our members; increased restrictions on rescinding coverage; establishment of minimum medical loss ratio, or MLR, and customer rebate requirements; establishment of a mandatory annual Health Insurance Provider Fee, or HIP Fee; creation of a federal rate review process; a requirement to cover preventive services on a first dollar basis; the establishment of public exchanges and essential benefit packages and greater limitations on how we price certain of our products. In addition, the legislation reduces the reimbursement levels for our health plans participating in the Medicare Advantage program over time and limits the amount of executive compensation that is deductible for income tax purposes.As a result of Health Care Reform, HHS issued MLR regulations that require us to meet minimum MLR thresholds for Large Group, Small Group and Individual lines of business. Plans that do not meet the minimum thresholds will have to pay a MLR rebate. For purposes of determining MLR rebates, HHS has defined the types of costs that should be included in the MLR rebate calculation. However, certain components of the MLR calculation as defined by HHS cannot be classified consistently under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. While considered benefit expense or a reduction of premium revenue by HHS, certain of these costs are classified as other types of expense, such as income tax expense or general and administrative expense, in our GAAP basis financial statements. Accordingly, the benefit expense ratio determined using our consolidated GAAP operating results is not comparable to the MLR calculated under HHS regulations. Health Care Reform also imposed a separate minimum MLR threshold of 85% for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans beginning in 2014. Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D plans that do not meet this threshold will have to pay a MLR rebate. If a plan’s MLR is below 85% for three consecutive years beginning with 2014, enrollment will be restricted. A Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D plan contract will be terminated if the plan's MLR is below 85% for five consecutive years. Beginning in 2014, Health Care Reform imposed an annual HIP Fee on health insurers that write certain types of health insurance on U.S. risks. The annual HIP Fee is allocated to health insurers based on the ratio of the amount of an insurer's net premium revenues written during the preceding calendar year to an adjusted amount of health insurance for all U.S. health risk for those certain lines of business written during the preceding calendar year. The HIP Fee is non-deductible for federal income tax purposes. The total amount collected from allocations to health insurers in 2015 and 2014 was $11,300.0 and $8,000.0, respectively. We record our estimated liability for the HIP Fee in full at the beginning of the year with a corresponding deferred asset that is amortized on a straight-line basis to general and administrative expense. The final calculation and payment of the annual HIP Fee occurs in the third quarter each year and our portion of the HIP Fee for 2015 and 2014 was $1,207.5 and $893.3, respectively. The annual HIP Fee to be allocated to all health insurers remains at $11,300.0 for 2016, has been suspended for 2017, and will resume and be increased to $14,300.0 for 2018. For 2019 and beyond, the annual HIP Fee will equal the amount for the preceding year increased by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year less the rate of growth in the consumer price index for the preceding calendar year.These and other provisions of Health Care Reform are likely to have significant effects on our future operations, which, in turn, could impact the value of our business model and results of operations, including potential impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets. We will continue to evaluate the impact of Health Care Reform as key aspects go into -47-effect and additional guidance is made available. For additional discussion regarding Health Care Reform, see Part I, Item 1 “Business—Regulation” and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Finally, federal and state regulatory agencies may further restrict our ability to obtain new product approvals, implement changes in premium rates or impose additional restrictions, under new or existing laws that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.We are also subject to regulations that may result in assessments under state insurance guaranty association laws. The National Organization of Life & Health Insurance Guaranty Associations, or NOLHGA, is a voluntary organization consisting of the state life and health insurance guaranty associations located throughout the U.S. Such associations, working together with NOLHGA, provide a safety net for their state’s policyholders, ensuring that they continue to receive coverage, subject to state maximum limits, even if their insurer is declared insolvent. We are aware that the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner, or Insurance Commissioner, has placed Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary American Network Insurance Company, or collectively Penn Treaty, in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency. The state court denied the Insurance Commissioner’s petition for the liquidation of Penn Treaty and ordered the Insurance Commissioner to file an updated plan of rehabilitation. The state court commenced a hearing in connection with the updated plan in July 2015, which has been adjourned. The state court has begun scheduling settlement conferences to resolve outstanding issues with the plan. In the event rehabilitation of Penn Treaty is unsuccessful and Penn Treaty is declared insolvent and placed in liquidation, we and other insurers may be required to pay a portion of their policyholder claims through state guaranty association assessments in future periods. Given the uncertainty around whether Penn Treaty will ultimately be declared insolvent and, if so, the amount of the insolvency, the amount and timing of any associated future guaranty fund assessments, and the availability and amount of any potential premium tax and other offsets, we currently cannot estimate our net exposure, if any, to this potential insolvency. We will continue to monitor the situation and may record a liability and expense in future reporting periods, which could be material to our cash flows and results of operations.In addition to the external forces discussed in the preceding paragraphs, our results of operations are impacted by levels and mix of membership. In recent years, we have experienced membership growth due to the quality and pricing of our health benefits products and services, improved economic conditions, decreases in unemployment, acquisitions, entry into new markets and expansions in existing markets. In addition, we believe the self-insured portion of our group membership base will continue to increase as a percentage of total group membership. However, these membership trends could be negatively impacted by various factors that could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations such as general economic downturns that result in business failures, failure to obtain new customers or retain existing customers, premium increases, benefit changes or our exit from a specific market. Further, our mix of membership may include more individuals with a higher acuity level obtaining coverage through our products available on the public exchanges, which may not be appropriately adjusted for in our premium rates. In February 2015, we reported that we were the target of a sophisticated external cyber attack. The attackers gained unauthorized access to certain of our information technology systems and obtained personal information related to many individuals and employees. We have continued to implement security enhancements since this incident and are supporting federal law enforcement efforts to identify the responsible parties. For additional information about the cyber attack, see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies - Cyber Attack Incident,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Also see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of the factors identified above and other risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time.Executive SummaryWe are one of the largest health benefits companies in terms of medical membership in the United States, serving 38.6 medical members through our affiliated health plans as of December 31, 2015. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or BCBS, licensee for Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (as BCBS in 10 New York City metropolitan and surrounding counties, and as Blue Cross or BCBS in selected upstate -48-counties only), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, or Empire Blue Cross (in our New York service areas). We also conduct business through an arrangement with another BCBS licensee in South Carolina. We conduct business through our AMERIGROUP Corporation, or Amerigroup, subsidiary, in Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and effective January 1, 2016, in Iowa. In addition, we conduct business through our recently acquired Simply Healthcare Holdings, Inc., or Simply Healthcare, subsidiary in Florida. We also serve customers throughout the country as HealthLink, UniCare (including a non-risk arrangement with Massachusetts), and in certain Arizona, California, Nevada and Virginia markets through our CareMore Health Group, Inc., or CareMore, subsidiary. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states through our subsidiaries. In preparation for the recent and ongoing changes to the U.S. health care system and to focus on our core growth opportunities across our Commercial and Specialty Business and Government Business segments, we entered into a definitive agreement in December 2013 to sell our 1-800 CONTACTS, Inc., or 1-800 CONTACTS, business to the private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. Concurrently, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Luxottica Group to sell our glasses.com related assets. The divestitures were completed on January 31, 2014. The operating results for 1-800 CONTACTS are reported as discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of income included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These results were previously reported in the Commercial and Specialty Business segment. Unless otherwise specified, all financial information disclosed in this MD&A is from continuing operations, other than net income, diluted earnings per share and cash flows. In accordance with FASB guidance, we have elected to not separately disclose net cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities and the net effect of those cash flows on cash and cash equivalents for discontinued operations during the periods presented. For additional information regarding these transactions, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestiture,"" to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $78,404.8, an increase of $5,383.1, or 7.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in operating revenue was primarily a result of higher premium revenue in our Government Business segment, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees in both our Commercial and Specialty Business and Government Business segments. These increases were partially offset by lower premium revenue in our Commercial and Specialty Business segment. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2,560.0, a decrease of $9.7, or 0.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in net income was primarily due to lower operating results in our Commercial and Specialty Business segment, higher income taxes, a decrease in net earnings from investment activities and increased interest expense. The decrease in net income was partially offset by an increase in the operating results of our Government Business segment and lower realized losses on the extinguishment of debt.Our fully-diluted earnings per share, or EPS, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $9.38, an increase of $0.39, or 4.3%, from the year ended December 31, 2014. Our diluted shares for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 272.9, a decrease of 13.0, or 4.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in EPS resulted from the lower number of shares outstanding in 2015 due to share buyback activity under our share repurchase program, partially offset by the decrease in net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $4,116.0, or 1.6 times net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $3,369.3, or 1.3 times net income. The increase in operating cash flow from 2014 of $746.7 was primarily attributable to an increase in premium receipts as a result of rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and the HIP Fee, and growth in membership. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was further attributable to the receipt of the reinsurance recoveries payment related to the 2014 Health Care Reform reinsurance premium stabilization program and payments made in 2014 that did not recur in 2015 for the adjudication of claims relating to the New York State contract conversion from our fully-insured Local Group business to a self-funded ASO contract. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in claims payments, primarily as a result of membership growth, an increase in income tax payments and an increase in the annual HIP Fee payment.-49-Our results of operations discussed throughout this MD&A are determined in accordance with GAAP. We also calculate operating gain, which is a non-GAAP measure, to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results and comparing them among periods. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, and selling, general and administrative expense. We use this measure as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and forecasting future operating periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income before income tax expense, net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional details on operating gain, see our “Reportable Segments Results of Operations” discussion included in this MD&A. For a reconciliation of reportable segment operating gain to income from continuing operations before income tax expense, see Note 19, ""Segment Information,"" to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We intend to expand through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions, including the pending acquisition of Cigna, and efficient use of capital in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. While we have achieved strong growth as a result of strategic mergers and acquisitions, we have also achieved organic growth in our existing markets over time by delivering excellent service, offering competitively priced products, providing access to high quality provider networks and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks.Significant TransactionsWhile Health Care Reform has caused significant changes to the U.S. health care system in recent years, the more significant transactions that have occurred over the last three years that have impacted or will impact our capital structure or that have or will influence how we conduct our business operations include:•Pending acquisition of Cigna expected to close in the second half of 2016;•Acquisition of Simply Healthcare (2015);•Board of Directors declaration of dividends on common stock (February 2016 and prior) and an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.6500 per share (February 2016); authorization for repurchases of our common stock (2015 and prior); and debt repurchases and new debt issuance (2015 and prior); and•Divestiture of 1-800 CONTACTS (2014).For additional information regarding these transactions, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestiture,” Note 12, ""Debt"" and Note 14, “Capital Stock,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.MembershipOur medical membership includes seven different customer types: Local Group, Individual, National Accounts, BlueCard®, Medicare, Medicaid and FEP. BCBS-branded business generally refers to members in our service areas licensed by the BCBSA. Non-BCBS-branded business refers to Amerigroup, CareMore and Simply Healthcare members as well as HealthLink and UniCare members predominantly outside of our BCBSA service areas.•Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. In addition, Local Group includes UniCare members and Employer Group Medicare Advantage members, or retired members of Local Group accounts who have selected a Medicare Advantage product. Local Group accounts are generally sold through brokers or consultants working with industry specialists from our in-house sales force and are offered both on and off the public exchanges. Local Group insurance premiums may be based on claims incurred by the group or sold on a self-insured basis. The customer’s buying decision is typically based upon the size and breadth of our networks, customer service, the quality of our medical management services, the administrative cost included in our quoted price, our financial stability, reputation -50-and our ability to effectively service large complex accounts. Local Group accounted for 39.5%, 40.4% and 41.3% of our medical members at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.•Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. Individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, retail partnerships, our in-house sales force or via the Internet. Individual business is sold on a fully-insured basis. We offer on-exchange products through public exchanges and off-exchange products. Federal premium subsidies are available only for certain public exchange Individual products. Individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network, and the efficiency of administration. Customer turnover is generally higher with Individual as compared to Local Group. Individual business accounted for 4.3%, 4.8% and 4.9% of our medical members at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.•National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in an Anthem service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker and consultant relationships. Service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. National Accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. We believe we have an advantage when competing for very large National Accounts due to the size and breadth of our networks and our ability to access the national provider networks of BCBS companies at their competitive local market rates. In addition, Employer Group Medicare Advantage members related to National Accounts groups are reported as part of National Accounts membership. The Employer Group Medicare Advantage members represent less than 1.0% of National Accounts membership. National Accounts represented 19.1%, 19.1% and 19.0% of our medical members at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.•BlueCard® host customers represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by Anthem who receive health care services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard® membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard® program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which an Anthem subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-Anthem controlled BCBSA licensee (i.e., the “home plan”). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard® members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard® members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard® claims received per month. BlueCard® host membership accounted for 14.0%, 14.1% and 14.2% of our medical members at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.•Medicare customers are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a managed care alternative for the Medicare program, who have purchased Medicare Supplement benefit coverage, some disabled members under age 65, or members of all ages with End Stage Renal Disease. We also include in the Medicare category members enrolled in our dual eligible Medicare-Medicaid Plans, or MMPs, in the states where we participate. Medicare Supplement policies are sold to Medicare recipients as supplements to the benefits they receive from the Medicare program. Rates are filed with and in some cases approved by state insurance departments. Most of the premium for Medicare Advantage is paid directly by the federal government on behalf of the participant who may also be charged a small premium. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. Medicare business accounted for 3.7%, 3.7% and 4.0% of our medical members at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.•Medicaid membership represents eligible members who receive health care benefits through publicly funded health care programs, including Medicaid, TANF, SPD, LTSS, CHIP and Medicaid expansion programs. Total Medicaid program business accounted for 15.3%, 13.8% and 12.3% of our medical members at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.•FEP members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. FEP business accounted for 4.1%, 4.1% and 4.3% of our medical members at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.-51-In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two principal funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some self-funded customers choose to purchase stop loss coverage to limit their retained risk.The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Also included below is other membership by product. The medical membership and other membership presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

These increases were partially offset by Local Group fully-insured membership declines, largely driven by conversions of fully-insured contracts to self-funded ASO contracts and our decision to exit the Georgia employer group Medicare product offering. The increase was further offset by attrition in our Individual business non-ACA-compliant product offerings.Local Group membership increased 104, or 0.7%, primarily due to increases in our self-funded accounts. The increase in membership was partially offset by attrition in our Small Group line of business resulting from product mix changes as members moved into Health Care Reform product offerings and competitive pressures. The increase was further offset by fully-insured membership declines resulting from our decision to exit the Georgia employer group Medicare product offering.Individual membership decreased 118, or 6.6%, primarily due to attrition in non-ACA-compliant product offerings, partially offset by increased sales in ACA-compliant on- and off-exchange product offerings.National Accounts membership increased 200, or 2.8%, primarily due to new sales and in-group change.BlueCard® membership increased 128, or 2.4%, primarily due to favorable membership activity at other BCBSA plans whose members reside in or travel to our licensed areas.Medicare membership increased 35, or 2.5%, primarily due to membership acquired through the acquisition of Simply Healthcare and growth in our MMPs primarily due to commencement of operations in new dual eligible markets.Medicaid membership increased 721, or 13.9%, primarily due to commencement of operations in new markets including membership acquired through the acquisition of Simply Healthcare, and growth through Health Care Reform expansions.FEP membership increased 30, or 2.0%, primarily due to higher sales during open enrollment.Other Membership (in thousands)Our Other products are often ancillary to our health business and can therefore be impacted by corresponding changes in our medical membership.Life and disability membership increased 87, or 1.8%, primarily due to growth and higher sales in our Local Group business.Dental membership increased 211, or 4.2%, primarily due to new sales and growth in our Local Group and Individual businesses, partially offset by attrition in our off-exchange Local Group and Individual business product offerings.Dental administration membership increased 364, or 7.4%, primarily due to the acquisition of a large managed dental contract pursuant to which we provide dental administrative services.Vision membership increased 545, or 10.7%, primarily due to increased sales and penetration in our Medicare business, and growth in our Local Group, National Accounts and Individual businesses. These increases were partially offset by attrition in our off-exchange Local Group and Individual business product offerings.-53-Medicare Advantage Part D membership decreased 68, or 9.9%, primarily due to membership declines resulting from our decision to exit the Georgia employer group Medicare product offering, partially offset by commencement of operations in new dual eligible markets and membership acquired through the acquisition of Simply Healthcare.Medicare Part D standalone membership decreased 96, or 20.6%, primarily due to our product repositioning strategies and select strategic actions in certain markets.December 31, 2014 Compared to December 31, 2013 Medical Membership (in thousands)During the year ended December 31, 2014, total medical membership increased 1,846, or 5.2%, primarily due to increases in our Medicaid, Local Group, National Accounts and BlueCard® membership.Self-funded medical membership increased 2,506, or 12.3%, primarily due to increases in our Local Group self-funded accounts including the New York State contract conversion from a fully-insured contract to a self-funded ASO contract and the acquisition of a large state ASO contract, which both occurred in the first quarter of 2014. The increase was further attributable to growth in our National Accounts and BlueCard® membership.Fully-insured membership decreased 660, or 4.3%, primarily due to the New York State contract conversion and Local Group membership losses as a result of affordability challenges affecting healthcare consumers. The decrease was partially offset by growth in our Medicaid business.Local Group membership increased 412, or 2.8%, primarily due to the acquisition of a large ASO state contract. This increase was partially offset by fully-insured membership declines resulting from affordability challenges affecting healthcare consumers.Individual membership increased 38, or 2.2%, primarily due to public exchange sales in the majority of our markets, partially offset by off-exchange lapses.National Accounts membership increased 378, or 5.6%, primarily due to new sales and in-group change partially offset by lapses.BlueCard® membership increased 229, or 4.5%, primarily due to favorable membership activity at other BCBSA plans whose members reside in or travel to our licensed areas.Medicare membership decreased 37, or 2.6%, primarily due to our product repositioning strategy toward HMO product offerings and select service area reductions.Medicaid membership increased 815, or 18.6%, primarily due to market expansions and commencement of operations in new markets.FEP membership increased 11, or 0.7%, primarily due to favorable open enrollment. Other Membership (in thousands)Our Other products are often ancillary to our health business and can therefore be impacted by corresponding changes in our medical membership.Life and disability membership decreased 57, or 1.2%, primarily due to higher lapses and in-group change in our Local Group and Individual businesses.Dental membership increased 100, or 2.0%, primarily due to new sales and growth in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses.Dental administration membership increased 32, or 0.7%, primarily due to membership expansion under current contracts.-54-Vision membership increased 353, or 7.4%, primarily due to strong sales and in-group change in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses.Medicare Advantage Part D membership increased 62, or 9.9%, primarily due to the addition of a new state contract, partially offset by decreases in various markets due to our product repositioning strategy toward HMO product offerings and select service area reductions.Medicare Part D standalone membership decreased 7, or 1.5%, primarily due to competitive pressure in certain markets.Cost of CareThe following discussion summarizes our aggregate underlying cost of care trends for the year ended December 31, 2015 for our Local Group fully-insured business only.Our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing the year-over-year change in average per member per month claim costs. While our cost of care trend varies by geographic location, based on underlying medical cost trends, we estimate that our aggregate cost of care trend was in the lower half of the 6.5% to 7.5% range for the full year of 2015. We anticipate that medical cost trends will be in the range of 7.0% to 7.5% in 2016.Medical utilization, including pharmacy utilization, has been lower than in previous years. Consistent with prior years, provider rate increases were a primary driver of medical cost trends. We continually negotiate with hospitals and physicians to manage these cost trends. We commonly negotiate multi-year contracts with hospitals and physicians, minimizing annual fluctuations in medical cost trend. We remain committed to optimizing our reimbursement rates and strategies to help address the cost pressures faced by employers and consumers. Unit cost increases were also a driver of pharmacy cost. High cost Hepatitis C drug therapies also have put upward pressure on pharmacy trend.In response to cost trends, we continue to pursue contracting and plan design changes, promote and implement performance-based contracts that reward clinical outcomes and quality, and expand our disease management and advanced care management programs. We are taking a leadership role in the area of payment reform as evidenced by our Enhanced Personal Health Care program. By establishing the primary care doctor as central to the coordination of a patient’s health care needs, the initiative builds on the success of current patient-centered medical home programs in helping to improve patient care while lowering costs.A number of clinical management initiatives are in place to help mitigate inpatient trend. Focused review efforts continue in key areas, including targeting outlier facilities for length of stay and readmission, and high risk maternity and neonatal intensive care unit cases, among others. Additionally, we continue to refine our programs related to readmission management, focused behavioral health readmission reduction and post-discharge follow-up care.Outpatient costs are a collection of different types of expenses, such as outpatient facilities, labs, x-rays, emergency room, occupational and physical therapy and many others. One example of the programs we have developed to mitigate outpatient costs is our Cancer Care Quality Program. This program, developed in collaboration with our subsidiary, AIM Specialty Health, identifies certain cancer treatment pathways selected based upon current medical evidence, peer-reviewed published literature, consensus guidelines and our clinical policies to support oncologists in identifying cancer treatment therapies that are highly effective and provide greater value.-55-Consolidated Results of OperationsOur consolidated summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are discussed in the following section.

Premiums for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $73,385.1, $68,389.8 and $66,119.1, respectively. Premiums are included in total operating revenue presented above.5bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%.6Selling, general and administrative expense ratio represents selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total operating revenue.-56-Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Total operating revenue increased $5,383.1, or 7.4%, to $78,404.8 in 2015, resulting primarily from higher premiums, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees. Higher premiums were mainly due to membership increases across our Government Business segment, including membership obtained through the acquisition of Simply Healthcare, and rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and the increase in the HIP Fee. The increase in premiums was further attributable to membership increases in our ACA-compliant on- and off-exchange Individual business product offerings and refinement of estimates associated with Medicare risk score revenue in the prior year. The increase in premiums was offset, in part, by the fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business, attrition in non-ACA-compliant Individual business product offerings and revised estimates made to accruals for the Health Care Reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program, including revised estimates of prior year accruals. The increase in administrative fees primarily resulted from rate increases and membership growth for self-funded members in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses.Net investment income decreased $46.8, or 6.5%, to $677.6 in 2015, primarily due to lower income from alternative investments, partially offset by higher investment yields on fixed maturity securities. Net realized gains on investments decreased $19.5, or 11.0%, to $157.5 in 2015, primarily due to an increase in net realized losses on sales of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by an increase in net realized gains on sales of equity securities and settlements of derivative financial instruments.Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments increased $34.4, or 70.2%, to $83.4 in 2015, primarily due to an increase in impairment losses on equity and fixed maturity securities.Benefit expense increased $4,262.0, or 7.5%, to $61,116.9 in 2015, primarily due to an increase in overall cost trends across our businesses, membership growth across our Government Business segment, including membership obtained through the acquisition of Simply Healthcare, and membership growth in our ACA-compliant on- and off-exchange Individual business product offerings. These increases were partially offset by the fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business and non-ACA-compliant Individual business product offerings, as described above. Our benefit expense ratio increased 20 basis points to 83.3% in 2015, largely driven by changes in the mix of the product portfolio, higher than expected medical costs in our Individual business, and adjustments made to current and prior year accruals related to the Health Care Reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program. These increases were partially offset by improvement in our Local Group business and certain Medicare lines of business predominantly due to improved medical cost performance. The increase in the ratio was further offset by refinement of estimates associated with Medicare risk score revenue in the prior year.Selling, general and administrative expense increased $786.4, or 6.7%, to $12,534.8 in 2015. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 10 basis points to 16.0% in 2015. The increase in the expense was primarily due to increased associate costs to support our growth in membership. The increase in expense was further due to net increases in Health Care Reform fees, primarily due to an increase in the HIP Fee of $314.2, and increased premium taxes as a result of the growth in premiums. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in assessments related to the Health Care Reform reinsurance premium stabilization program of $163.4. The decrease in the ratio was primarily due to the impact of Medicaid membership growth in our Government Business segment, which has a lower selling, general and administrative expense ratio than our consolidated average.Other expense decreased $28.9, or 3.2%, to $873.8 in 2015, primarily due to changes in gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized net gains on extinguishment of debt of $9.3 compared to net losses on extinguishment of debt of $81.1 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in other expense was partially offset by higher interest expense in 2015 driven by higher outstanding debt balances and the amortization of fees incurred for the obtainment of the bridge facility commitment letter and joinder agreement to partially fund the pending acquisition of Cigna. The decrease in other expense was further offset by an increase in amortization of intangible assets. For additional information related to our borrowings, see ""Liquidity and Capital Resources,"" below. Income tax expense increased $263.0, or 14.5%, to $2,071.0 in 2015. The effective tax rates in 2015 and 2014 were 44.7% and 41.4%, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the increase of the non-tax -57-deductible HIP Fee, increased income before income taxes and increased state tax expense as a result of an adverse California franchise tax ruling. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2015 was primarily due to the increase in the non-tax deductible HIP fee and the state tax impact of the adverse California franchise tax ruling. Our net income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 30 basis points to 3.2% in 2015 as compared to 2014 as a result of all factors discussed above.Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Total operating revenue increased $2,830.3, or 4.0% to $73,021.7 in 2014, resulting primarily from higher premiums and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees. Higher premiums were mainly due to rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and new fees associated with Health Care Reform, including HIP Fees reimbursed by Medicaid state plans. The increase in premiums was further attributable to membership increases in our Medicaid and Individual businesses. The increase in premiums was offset, in part, by fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business as a result of the New York State contract conversion and affordability challenges affecting healthcare consumers. The increase was further offset by higher experience rated refunds in our Medicaid business, and lower premiums in our Medicare Advantage business primarily due to membership declines and a refinement of estimates associated with Medicare risk score revenue for prior years. The increase in administrative fees primarily resulted from membership growth in our Local Group business, including the New York State contract conversion and the acquisition of a large state ASO contract, which both occurred in the first quarter of 2014. The increase in administrative fees was further attributable to growth in our National Accounts business. Net investment income increased $65.3, or 9.9%, to $724.4 in 2014, primarily due to higher income from alternative investments and higher investment yields. Net realized gains on investments decreased $94.9, or 34.9%, to $177.0 in 2014, primarily due to a decrease in net realized gains on sales of equity securities, partially offset by an increase in net realized gains on sales of fixed maturity securities.Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments decreased $49.9, or 50.5%, to $49.0 in 2014, primarily due to a decrease in impairment losses on certain joint venture investments and fixed maturity securities.Benefit expense increased $617.8, or 1.1%, to $56,854.9 in 2014, primarily due to benefit cost trends across our businesses and membership growth in our Medicaid and Individual businesses. The increase in benefit expense was further a result of higher pharmacy costs primarily attributable to new high cost Hepatitis C drug therapies. These increases were partially offset by the fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group and Medicare Advantage businesses, as described above. In addition, the increase in benefit expense was offset, in part, by our estimate of reinsurance recoveries relating to the Health Care Reform reinsurance premium stabilization program of $753.4 for 2014.Our benefit expense ratio decreased 200 basis points to 83.1% in 2014, primarily due to rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and new fees associated with Health Care Reform, including additional premiums collected to help cover the non-tax deductible impact of the HIP Fee. The decrease was further attributable to better than expected medical cost trends in our Medicaid business. These improvements were partially offset by higher pharmacy costs primarily attributable to new high cost Hepatitis C drug therapies.Selling, general and administrative expense increased $1,795.5, or 18.0%, to $11,748.4 in 2014. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio increased 190 basis points to 16.1% in 2014. The increases in the expense and ratio were both primarily due to new fees related to Health Care Reform that were effective January 1, 2014, including $893.3 for the HIP Fee and $447.7 of assessments related to the Health Care Reform reinsurance premium stabilization program. Other expense decreased $90.6, or 9.1%, to $902.7 in 2014, primarily due to lower losses recognized on debt extinguishment associated with the early redemption and repurchase of outstanding senior unsecured notes. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized losses on extinguishment of debt of $81.1 and $145.3, respectively. The decrease in other expense was further attributable to reduced amortization of certain other intangible assets acquired in prior years. For additional information related to our borrowings, see ""Liquidity and Capital Resources,"" below.-58-Income tax expense increased $602.1, or 49.9%, to $1,808.0 in 2014. The effective tax rates in 2014 and 2013 were 41.4% and 31.4%, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the non-tax deductible HIP Fee effective for 2014 and increased income before income taxes. The 2013 expense and effective tax rate were lower because they include benefits resulting from a favorable tax election made subsequent to the Amerigroup acquisition and from inclusion of Amerigroup in our state apportionment factors calculation, which produces a lower state tax expense. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2014 was primarily due to the non-tax deductible HIP fee.Our net income as a percentage of total revenue was 3.5% in 2014 and 2013 as a result of all factors discussed above. Reportable Segments Results of OperationsWe use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, which are Commercial and Specialty Business; Government Business; and Other. Operating gain, which is a non-GAAP measure, is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense and selling, general and administrative expense. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains/losses on investments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, loss on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. The discussion of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional information, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, see Note 19, “Segment Information,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our Commercial and Specialty Business, Government Business, and Other segments’ summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows: Change Years Ended December 31 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 2015 2014 2013 $ % $ %Commercial and Specialty Business Operating revenue$37,570.8 $39,199.6 $39,404.2 $(1,628.8) (4.2)% $(204.6) (0.5)%Operating gain$2,854.0 $3,260.9 $3,176.4 $(406.9) (12.5)% $84.5 2.7 %Operating margin7.6% 8.3% 8.1% (70)bp 20bpGovernment Business Operating revenue$40,813.0 $33,796.4 $30,752.6 $7,016.6 20.8 % $3,043.8 9.9 %Operating gain$1,978.5 $1,191.9 $844.0 $786.6 66.0 % $347.9 41.2 %Operating margin4.8% 3.5% 2.7% 130bp 80bpOther Operating revenue1$21.0 $25.7 $34.6 $(4.7) (18.3)% $(8.9) (25.7)%Operating loss2$(79.4) $(34.4) $(19.0) $(45.0) 130.8 % $(15.4) 81.1 % 1Fluctuations not material.2Fluctuations are primarily a result of changes in unallocated corporate expenses. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to transaction costs associated with our pending acquisition of Cigna.-59-Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Commercial and Specialty BusinessOperating revenue decreased $1,628.8, or 4.2%, to $37,570.8 in 2015, due in part to fully-insured membership declines in our Large Group business largely driven by the discontinuation of our Georgia employer group Medicare product offering. The decrease in operating revenue was further attributable to attrition in our Small Group line of business resulting from both product mix changes as members moved into Health Care Reform product offerings and competitive pressures. Additionally, operating revenue decreased as a result of attrition in non-ACA-compliant Individual business product offerings and revised estimates made to accruals for the Health Care Reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program, including revised estimates of prior year accruals. These decreases were partially offset by premium rate increases in our Individual and Local Group lines of business designed to cover overall cost trends and the increase in the HIP Fee. The decrease in operating revenue was further offset by membership growth in our ACA-compliant on- and off-exchange Individual business product offerings and increased administrative fees. The increase in administrative fees was primarily attributable to membership growth and rate increases for self-funded members in our Large Group and National Accounts businesses.Operating gain decreased $406.9, or 12.5%, to $2,854.0 in 2015, primarily due to higher than expected medical costs in our Individual business, membership declines in our fully-insured Local Group and Individual lines of business and revised estimates made to current and prior year accruals related to the Health Care Reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in operating gain in our Local Group business primarily due to improved medical cost performance. The increase in operating gain was further offset by increases in self-funded membership in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses. The operating margin in 2015 was 7.6%, a 70 basis point decrease from 2014, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.Government BusinessOperating revenue increased $7,016.6, or 20.8%, to $40,813.0 in 2015. The increase in operating revenue was primarily due to increased premiums in our Medicaid business as a result of membership growth through commencement of operations in new markets including membership obtained through the acquisition of Simply Healthcare, membership growth through Health Care Reform expansions and membership growth in existing markets. The increase in Medicaid premiums was further due to rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends and the increase in the HIP Fee. The increase in operating revenue was further attributable to premium increases in our Medicare business as a result of rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends, the acquisition of Simply Healthcare and refinement of estimates associated with Medicare risk score revenue in the prior year. Finally, increased premiums in our FEP business primarily due to increased benefit utilization contributed to the increase in operating revenue. Operating gain increased $786.6, or 66.0%, to $1,978.5 in 2015, primarily due to membership growth and improved medical cost performance in certain markets in our Medicaid and Medicare business, and refinement of estimates associated with Medicare risk score revenue in the prior year that did not recur in the current year. The increase in operating gain was further attributable to higher reimbursements for the non-tax deductible portion of the HIP Fee. These increases were partially offset by higher administrative costs to support our growth in membership. The operating margin in 2015 was 4.8%, a 130 basis point increase over 2014, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Commercial and Specialty BusinessOperating revenue decreased $204.6, or 0.5%, to $39,199.6 in 2014, primarily due to fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business resulting from the impact of the New York State contract conversion and affordability challenges affecting healthcare consumers. These decreases were partially offset by premium rate increases in our Local Group and Individual businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and new fees associated with Health Care Reform, and membership growth in our Individual business. The decrease in operating revenue was further offset by increased -60-administrative fees primarily resulting from membership growth in our Local Group business, including the acquisition of a large state ASO contract in the first quarter of 2014. The increase in administrative fees was further attributable to growth in our National Accounts business. Operating gain increased $84.5, or 2.7%, to $3,260.9 in 2014, primarily as a result of improved performance in our Individual business reflecting our public exchange strategy implemented during the year, along with membership growth in self-funded products. The increase in operating gain was further attributable to additional premiums collected to help cover the non-tax deductible impact of the HIP Fee. These increases were partially offset by insured membership declines in our Local Group business, continued costs incurred associated with Health Care Reform market changes and higher pharmacy costs primarily attributable to new high cost Hepatitis C drug therapies.The operating margin in 2014 was 8.3%, a 20 basis point increase over 2013, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Government BusinessOperating revenue increased $3,043.8, or 9.9%, to $33,796.4 in 2014, primarily due to increased premiums in our Medicaid and FEP businesses as a result of premium rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends and new fees associated with Health Care Reform. The increase in operating revenue was further attributable to membership growth in our Medicaid business and additional premiums collected to help cover the non-tax deductible impact of the HIP Fee. These increases were partially offset by higher experience rated refunds in our Medicaid business, lower premiums in our Medicare businesses, primarily due to membership declines in our Medicare Advantage business, and a refinement of estimates associated with Medicare risk score revenue for prior years. Operating gain increased $347.9, or 41.2%, to $1,191.9 in 2014, primarily due to better than expected medical cost trends and membership growth in our Medicaid business. These increases were partially offset by higher pharmacy costs primarily attributable to new high cost Hepatitis C drug therapies, and a refinement of estimates associated with Medicare risk score revenue for prior years.The operating margin in 2014 was 3.5%, an 80 basis point increase over 2013, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider our most important accounting policies that require significant estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our other significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances.Medical Claims Payable The most subjective accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2015, this liability was $7,569.8 and represented 19.6% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 96.7%, or $7,317.0, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2015; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 3.3%, or $252.8, of the total medical claims payable as of December 31, 2015. The level of -61-claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period end to the next, from approximately 1% to 5% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made.Liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be appropriate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or “trend factors.”Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison of prior year, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense.We regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable.While there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid claims liability as of December 31, 2015 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by other operational variables including system changes, provider submission patterns and business combinations.There is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through twelve months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. In our analysis for the claim liabilities at December 31, 2015, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 40 and 90 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower variability ranging from 0 to 30 basis points.The difference in completion factor assumptions, assuming moderately adverse experience, results in variability of 2%, or approximately $168.0, in the December 31, 2015 incurred but not paid claims liability, depending on the completion -62-factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein.The other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2015 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. In our analysis for the period ended December 31, 2015, there was a 330 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors assuming moderately adverse experience. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 4%, or approximately $337.0, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factors used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claims liability at December 31, 2015. See Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year.” Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. The ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 89.1% for 2015, 89.4% for 2014 and 89.3% for 2013. The decrease in this ratio for 2015 reflects slower claims processing that occurred over the most recent year.We calculate the percentage of prior years’ redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior years' net incurred claims payable less prior years’ redundancies in the current year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior years’ reserves. This metric was 15.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015, 9.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 10.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The year ended December 31, 2015 metric reflects a slightly higher level of conservatism compared to the targeted prior year reserve for adverse deviation and a resultant higher level of prior years' redundancies than the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.We calculate the percentage of prior years’ redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior years’ net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation supports the reasonableness of our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims and the consistency in our methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2015, this metric was 1.4%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $800.2. This metric was 1.0% for 2014 and 1.3% for 2013.The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for each of 2014 and 2013 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims – current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims – prior years redundancies” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 2014 2013Total net incurred medical claims, as reported$55,763.9 $55,295.2Retrospective basis, as described above55,505.6 55,352.4Variance$258.3 $(57.2)Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported0.5% (0.1)%Given that our business is primarily short tailed (which means that medical claims are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider), the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported -63-above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2015 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2016.The 2014 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of 0.5% was greater in absolute value than the 2013 percentage of (0.1)%. The higher 2014 variance was driven by a higher level of prior year redundancies in 2015 associated with 2014 claim payments. Prior year redundancies in 2013 associated with 2012 claim payments were lower by comparison, thus creating a lower 2013 variance.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes in accordance with FASB guidance, which requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance.At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following:•the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset;•the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim;•the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and•any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences.We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits, as required by the guidance. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted.In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we intend to defend our positions vigorously through the federal, state and local appeals processes. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact on our results of operations from these matters.For additional information, see Note 7, “Income Taxes,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsOur consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2015 was $17,562.2 and other intangible assets were $8,158.0. The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets represented 41.7% of our total consolidated assets and 111.6% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2015.We follow FASB guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, -64-which include goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately.We complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. These tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Certain interim impairment tests are also performed when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur.Fair value is estimated using the income and market approaches for goodwill at the reporting unit level and the income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. Use of the income and market approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. The income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. These estimated future cash flows are then discounted. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted-average cost of capital. Market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including membership, revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry.We did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2015 annual impairment tests as the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying values as of December 31, 2015. Additionally, we do not believe that the estimated fair values of our reporting units are at risk of becoming impaired in the next twelve months. However, as a result of certain provisions of Health Care Reform, along with current economic conditions, we have experienced lower operating margins in certain lines of business. Those margins could become further compressed if results from implementation of Health Care Reform are significantly different than anticipated. As a result, the estimated fair values of certain of our reporting units with goodwill could fall below their carrying values in future periods and if that were to occur, we would be required to record impairment losses at that time.While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.For additional information, see Note 3, ""Business Acquisitions and Divestiture"" and Note 9, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Investments Current and long-term available-for-sale investment securities were $18,951.0 at December 31, 2015 and represented 30.7% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2015. We classify fixed maturity and equity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” or “trading” and report those securities at fair value. Certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity.We review investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. In addition, for equity securities, we determine whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time to allow for a -65-recovery of its fair value above its carrying amount. If any declines of equity securities are determined to be other-than-temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made.Certain FASB other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, guidance applies to fixed maturity securities and provides guidance on the recognition, presentation of, and disclosures for OTTIs. If a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and is presented within the Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income line item on our consolidated statements of income. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, the credit component of the OTTI is presented within the Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income line item on our consolidated statements of income and the non-credit component of the OTTI is recognized in other comprehensive income. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The credit component of an OTTI is determined primarily by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of acquisition. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other debt securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings, and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default.We have a committee of accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. The current economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets.We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. This could result in other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments being charged against future income. Given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional, material other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments may be recorded in future periods.In addition to available-for-sale investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $2,041.1, or 3.3% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2015. These long-term investments consisted primarily of certain other equity investments, cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and real estate. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term.Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage the market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits on investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future earnings and financial position. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $17,478.2 at December 31, 2015. The weighted-average credit rating of these securities was “A” as of December 31, 2015. Included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate securities of $1,483.5, $3.2 and $0.3, respectively, that are guaranteed by third parties. With the exception of twenty-seven securities with a fair value of $11.5, these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2015. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities without a guarantee was “AA” as of December 31, 2015 for the securities for which such information is available.-66-At December 31, 2015, we owned $777.2 of energy sector fixed maturity securities out of a total available-for-sale investment portfolio of $18,951.0. These energy sector securities had accumulated net unrealized losses of $172.0 and have the potential for material future credit loss impairments if oil and natural gas prices stay at current levels or are further suppressed.Fair values of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with FASB guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. We have controls in place to review the pricing services’ qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. In addition, we periodically review the pricing services’ pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable.We obtain only one quoted price for each security from the pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform monthly analysis on the prices received from the pricing services to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes a review of month-to-month price fluctuations. If unusual fluctuations are noted in this review, we may obtain additional information from other pricing services to validate the quoted price. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from the pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.In certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. Such securities are designated Level III in accordance with FASB guidance. Securities designated Level III at December 31, 2015 totaled $315.8 and represented approximately 1.5% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level III securities primarily consisted of certain corporate securities, equity securities and structured securities for which observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using internal estimates for inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields.For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”, and Part II, Item 8, Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” Note 4, “Investments,” and Note 6, “Fair Value,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Retirement Benefits Pension BenefitsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for some of our employees. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FASB guidance for retirement benefits, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by the guidance, we calculate the value of plan assets as described below. Further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods. An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our December 31, 2015 measurement date, we selected a weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.84%. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and an average of historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase.-67-This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. We apply a corridor approach to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. Under this approach, only accumulated net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the average remaining service or lifetime of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date. At the December 31, 2015 measurement date, the selected weighted-average discount rate was 3.92%, compared to 3.66% at the December 31, 2014 measurement date. We developed this rate using a yield curve approach. Using yields available on high-quality fixed maturity securities with various maturity dates, the yield curve approach provides a “customized” rate, which is meant to match the expected cash flows of our specific benefit plans. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FASB guidance.In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities, equity securities and alternative investments across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow.Other Postretirement BenefitsWe provide most associates with certain medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits.At our December 31, 2015 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 4.01%, compared to a discount rate of 3.74% at the December 31, 2014 measurement date. We developed this rate using a yield curve approach as described above.The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of pre-Medicare (those who are not currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2015 measurement date was 8.00% for 2016 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2028. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of post-Medicare (those who are currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2015 measurement date was 5.75% for 2016 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2021. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2015 by $45.0 and would increase service and interest costs by $2.2. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by $38.3 as of December 31, 2015 and would decrease service and interest costs by $1.8.For additional information regarding our retirement benefits, see Note 10, “Retirement Benefits,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.New Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended December 31, 2015 that had, or are expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures, see the “Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance” and “Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted” sections of Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.-68-Liquidity and Capital ResourcesIntroductionOur cash receipts result primarily from premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity.We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy.A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations.The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. The securities and credit markets have been experiencing higher than normal volatility. During recent years, the federal government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to restore liquidity in the financial markets and to help relieve the credit crisis and strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. In addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide liquidity and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions. We have a $2,500.0 commercial paper program. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we have the ability to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our $3,500.0 senior revolving credit facility to redeem any outstanding commercial paper upon maturity. Additionally, we believe the lenders participating in our credit facility would be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. In addition to the $3,500.0 senior revolving credit facility, we estimate that we will receive approximately $2,100.0 of dividends from our subsidiaries during 2016, which also provides further operating and financial flexibility. The table below outlines the cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013: Years Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities$4,116.0 $3,369.3 $3,052.3Investing activities(1,151.5) (974.9) (2,234.4)Financing activities(2,997.4) (1,822.5) (1,717.8)Effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(5.3) (7.1) 2.2(Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents$(38.2) $564.8 $(897.7)-69-Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 During the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $4,116.0, compared to $3,369.3 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $746.7. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in premium receipts as a result of rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and the HIP Fee, and growth in membership. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was further attributable to the receipt of the reinsurance recoveries payment related to the 2014 Health Care Reform reinsurance premium stabilization program and payments made in 2014 that did not recur in 2015 for the adjudication of claims relating to the New York State contract conversion from our fully-insured Local Group business to a self-funded ASO contract. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in claims payments, primarily as a result of membership growth, an increase in income tax payments and an increase in the annual HIP Fee payment.Net cash flow used in investing activities was $1,151.5 during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $974.9 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cash flow used in investing activities of $176.6 primarily resulted from changes in cash flows relating to the purchase and sale of subsidiaries. Cash utilized for the purchase of subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to the purchase of Simply Healthcare. During the year ended December 31, 2014, cash was provided by the sale of our 1-800 CONTACTS business and glasses.com related assets. The increase in cash flow used in investing activities was partially offset by changes in securities lending collateral and a decrease in net purchases of investments.Net cash flow used in financing activities was $2,997.4 during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1,822.5 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cash flow used in financing activities of $1,174.9 primarily resulted from changes in long-term borrowings as a result of net repayments of long-term borrowings during 2015 compared to net proceeds from long-term borrowings during 2014. The increase in cash flow used in financing activities was further attributable to changes in securities lending payable, changes in bank overdrafts, an increase in cash dividends paid to shareholders and a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. The increase in cash flow used in financing activities was partially offset by a decrease in common stock repurchases, an increase in net proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, an increase in net proceeds from short-term borrowings and an increase in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation.Liquidity— Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 During the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $3,369.3, compared to $3,052.3 for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $317.0. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in premium receipts as a result of rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and new fees associated with Health Care Reform and an increase in administrative fee receipts primarily as a result of growth in membership. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was offset, in part, by payments for new fees associated with Health Care Reform, including the HIP Fee and assessments related to the Health Care Reform reinsurance premium stabilization program. The increase was further offset by an increase in claims payments primarily as a result of membership growth, an increase in personnel service costs and an increase in income taxes paid.Net cash flow used in investing activities was $974.9 during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $2,234.4 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in cash flow used in investing activities of $1,259.5 primarily resulted from cash provided by the sale of our 1-800 CONTACTS business and glasses.com related assets on January 31, 2014 and a decrease in net purchases of investments, partially offset by changes in securities lending collateral.Net cash flow used in financing activities was $1,822.5 during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $1,717.8 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in cash flow used in financing activities of $104.7 primarily resulted from an increase in common stock repurchases, a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans and an increase in net repayments of commercial paper borrowings. These increases in net cash used in financing activities were partially offset by changes in short- and long-term borrowings as a result of net proceeds received from long-term borrowings during 2014 compared to net repayments of short- and long-term borrowings during 2013. In addition, the increase in net cash flow used in financing activities was partially offset by changes in bank overdrafts and changes in securities lending payable.-70-Financial Condition We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, of $23,124.7 at December 31, 2015. Since December 31, 2014, total cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, decreased by $653.0 primarily due to common stock repurchases, net repayments of short- and long-term borrowings, cash dividends paid to shareholders, the acquisition of Simply Healthcare, purchases of property and equipment, decreases in bank overdrafts and decreases in securities lending payables. These decreases were partially offset by cash generated from operations, net proceeds received from commercial paper borrowings, decreases in securities lending collateral, proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Certain accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities, or statutory accounting practices, differ from GAAP. Changes that occur in statutory accounting practices, if any, could impact our subsidiaries' future dividend capacity. In addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries.At December 31, 2015, we held $1,368.3 of cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company, which are available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, potential future common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders, repurchases of debt securities and debt and interest payments. DebtDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased $920.0 of the aggregate principal balance of our outstanding senior convertible debentures due 2042, or the Debentures. In addition, $66.6 aggregate principal balance was surrendered for conversion by certain holders in accordance with the terms and provisions of the indenture governing the Debentures. We elected to settle the excess of the principal amount of the repurchases and conversions with cash for total payments of $2,055.7. We recognized a gain on the extinguishment of debt related to the Debentures of $12.7, based on the fair values of the debt on the repurchase and conversion settlement dates. On September 10, 2015, we repaid, upon maturity, the $625.0 outstanding principal balance of our 1.25% senior unsecured notes due 2015. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased $13.0 of outstanding principal balance of certain other senior unsecured notes, plus applicable premium, accrued and unpaid interest, for cash totaling $16.2. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.4 on the repurchase of these notes.On May 12, 2015, we issued 25.0 Equity Units, pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated May 6, 2015, in an aggregate principal amount of $1,250.0. Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $50 (whole dollars) and consists of a purchase contract obligating the holder to purchase a certain number of shares of our common stock on May 1, 2018, subject to earlier termination or settlement, for a price in cash of $50 (whole dollars); and a 5% undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 (whole dollars) principal amount of our 1.900% remarketable subordinated notes, or RSNs, due 2028. We received $1,228.8 in cash proceeds from the issuance of the Equity Units, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us, and recorded $1,250.0 in long-term debt. On September 15, 2014, we redeemed the $500.0 outstanding principal balance of our 5.000% senior unsecured notes due 2014, plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, for cash totaling $512.3. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.3 on the redemption of these notes.On September 11, 2014, we redeemed the $1,097.9 outstanding principal balance of our 5.250% senior unsecured notes due 2016, plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, for cash totaling $1,178.2. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $67.6 on the redemption of these notes. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we repurchased $52.0 of outstanding principal amount of certain other senior unsecured notes, plus applicable premium for early redemption plus accrued and unpaid interest, for cash totaling $61.0. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.2 for the year ended December 31, 2014 on the repurchase of these notes.-71-On August 12, 2014, we issued $850.0 of 2.250% notes due 2019, $800.0 of 3.500% notes due 2024, $800.0 of 4.650% notes due 2044, and $250.0 of 4.850% notes due 2054 under our shelf registration statement. We used the proceeds from this offering in part to fund the purchase price of the 5.000% and 5.250% senior unsecured notes discussed above, and the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year and commenced on February 15, 2015. The notes have a call feature that allows us to redeem the notes at any time at our option and a put feature that allows a note holder to redeem the notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the notes below an investment grade rating. On September 5, 2013, we redeemed the $400.0 outstanding principal balance of our 6.000% senior unsecured notes due 2014, plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, for cash totaling $411.0. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $10.0 on the redemption of these notes.On July 30, 2013, we initiated a cash tender offer and consent solicitation to purchase up to $300.0 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5.875% notes due 2017 and 7.000% notes due 2019 (the “First Tranche Offer”) and to purchase up to $300.0 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5.950% notes due 2034, 5.850% notes due 2036, 6.375% notes due 2037 and 5.800% notes due 2040 (the “Second Tranche Offer”), collectively, the “Tender Offers”. The Tender Offers were each subject to increase up to an additional $100.0 at our election. On August 12, 2013, we increased the Second Tranche Offer to $400.0 and on August 13, 2013 we repurchased $300.0 of the First Tranche Offer notes and $400.0 of the Second Tranche Offer notes for cash totaling $837.7. Holders who tendered their notes prior to the early tender date received the principal amounts, applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the early tender offer settlement date. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $135.3 on the repurchase of these notes.On July 30, 2013, we issued $650.0 of 2.300% notes due 2018 and $600.0 of 5.100% notes due 2044 under our shelf registration statement. We used the proceeds from this offering in part to fund the purchase price of the 6.000% senior unsecured notes and the Tender Offers discussed above, and the balance for general corporate purposes. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year and commenced on January 15, 2014. The notes have a call feature that allows us to repurchase the notes at any time at our option and a put feature that allows a note holder to require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the notes below an investment grade rating.On January 25, 2013, we redeemed the outstanding principal balance of $475.0 of 7.500% senior unsecured notes due 2019, plus applicable premium, accrued and unpaid interest, for cash totaling $555.6. The weighted-average redemption price of the notes was approximately 117% of the principal amount outstanding.For additional information related to our borrowing activities, see Note 12, “Debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We calculate our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, a non-GAAP measure, which we believe assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. In addition, our bank covenants include a maximum debt-to-capital ratio that we cannot and did not exceed. Our debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt plus shareholders’ equity. Our debt-to-capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio was 40.8% and 38.3% as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect that our pro forma debt-to-capital ratio will approximate 49% at the closing of the acquisition of Cigna and we are committed to deleveraging to the low 40% range approximately twenty-four months following the closing.Our senior debt is rated “A” by Standard & Poor’s, “BBB” by Fitch, Inc., “Baa2” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. A significant downgrade in our debt ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs.Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity During the year ended December 31, 2015, we entered into a bridge facility commitment letter and a joinder agreement, and a term loan facility, to finance a portion of the pending acquisition of Cigna. The commitment of the lenders to provide the bridge facility and the term loan facility is subject to several conditions, including the completion of the Acquisition. For additional information, see the ""Overview"" section included in this ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial -72-Condition and Results of Operations""; and Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestiture - Pending Acquisition of Cigna Corporation"" included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have a shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. In April 2015, we filed a post-effective amendment to our shelf registration statement to register warrants, depositary shares, rights, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units as additional securities that can be offered under the shelf registration statement. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries and the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion.On August 25, 2015, we terminated our $2,000.0 senior revolving credit facility, initially scheduled to mature on September 29, 2016, and entered into a new $3,500.0 senior revolving credit facility, or the Facility, with a group of lenders. The interest rate on the Facility is based on either the LIBOR rate or a base rate plus a predetermined rate based on our public debt rating at the date of utilization. Our ability to borrow under the Facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. The Facility matures on August 25, 2020 and is available for general corporate purposes. There were no amounts outstanding under the senior revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2015 or 2014.We have an authorized commercial paper program of up to $2,500.0, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2015, we had $682.2 outstanding under our commercial paper program. We did not have any borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program at December 31, 2014. Commercial paper borrowings have been classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2015 as our general practice and intent is to replace short-term commercial paper outstanding at expiration with additional short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one year and we have the ability to redeem our commercial paper with borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility described above. We are a member, through certain subsidiaries, of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, collectively, the FHLBs, and as a member we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, $540.0 and $400.0, respectively, were outstanding under our short-term FHLBs borrowings.As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we are currently estimating approximately $2,100.0 of dividends to be paid to the parent company during 2016. During 2015, we received $2,672.3 of dividends from our subsidiaries.We regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions, common stock and debt security repurchases and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.A summary of the cash dividend activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows:Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date CashDividendper Share TotalJanuary 27, 2015 March 10, 2015 March 25, 2015 $0.6250 $166.6April 28, 2015 June 10, 2015 June 25, 2015 0.6250 163.9July 28, 2015 September 10, 2015 September 25, 2015 0.6250 163.0October 27, 2015 December 4, 2015 December 21, 2015 0.6250 163.1On February 18, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.6500 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on March 25, 2016 to the shareholders of record as of March 10, 2016.-73-A summary of common stock repurchases for the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows: Year EndedDecember 31,2015Shares repurchased 10.4Average price per share $145.50Aggregate cost $1,515.8Authorization remaining at the end of each period $4,175.9On October 2, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a $5,000.0 increase to the common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. The repurchases are effected from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase agreements, and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We expect to utilize the unused authorization remaining at December 31, 2015 over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares under the program when we believe it is a prudent use of capital. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015 are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 YearsOn-Balance Sheet: Debt1 $24,742.8 $1,276.2 $3,316.6 $2,973.9 $17,176.1Other long-term liabilities2 1,317.8 62.4 518.0 464.9 272.5Off-Balance Sheet: Purchase obligations32,819.3 1,820.5 750.9 247.9 —Operating lease commitments848.7 141.5 267.2 194.2 245.8Investment commitments4685.3 272.8 224.7 148.9 38.9Total contractual obligations and commitments$30,413.9 $3,573.4 $5,077.4 $4,029.8 $17,733.3 1Includes estimated interest expense. 2Primarily consists of reserves for future policy benefits, projected other postretirement benefits, deferred compensation, supplemental executive retirement plan liabilities and certain other miscellaneous long-term obligations. Estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from this table as we had no funding requirements under ERISA at December 31, 2015 as a result of the value of the assets in the plans. 3Includes estimated payments for future services under contractual arrangements from third-party service contracts.4Includes unfunded capital commitments for alternative investments.The above table does not contain $224.3 of gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions and interest for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities. For further information, see Note 7, “Income Taxes,” to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our senior revolving credit facility, bridge facility, term loan facility and/or from public or private financing sources, will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions.-74-Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet derivative instruments, guarantee transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements or any indemnification agreements that will require funding in future periods. We have not transferred assets to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not hold any variable interest in an unconsolidated entity where such entity provides us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support.Risk-Based CapitalOur regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies and health maintenance organizations largely based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under the RBC Model Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our regulated subsidiaries' respective RBC levels as of December 31, 2015, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, were in excess of all mandatory RBC thresholds. In addition to exceeding the RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries.For additional information, see Note 21, “Statutory Information,"" to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date hereof. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable securities laws. Investors are also advised to carefully review and consider the various risks and other disclosures discussed in our SEC reports.-76-ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. (In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein)As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2015. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return.InvestmentsOur investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk.The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit event, such as a ratings downgrade or default, to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that event. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately “A.” Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which have exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value.Our available-for-sale investment portfolio includes corporate securities which account for 41.7% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2015 and are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. We manage this risk through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of our corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately “BBB.”Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systemic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio.As of December 31, 2015, 92.2% of our available-for-sale investments were fixed maturity securities. Market risk is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $776.2 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $732.9 increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly.As of December 31, 2015, 7.8% of our available-for-sale investments were equity securities. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $147.3. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $147.3.-77-For additional information regarding our investments, see Part II, Item 8, Note 4, “Investments”, to our audited consolidated financial statements and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Investments” within Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Long-Term DebtOur total long-term debt at December 31, 2015 consists of senior unsecured notes, remarketable subordinated notes, convertible debentures, commercial paper and subordinated surplus notes by one of our insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2015, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $15,324.5 and $16,185.5, respectively. This debt is subject to interest rate risk as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. For additional information regarding our long-term debt, see Note 6, ""Fair Value"" and Note 12, “Debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.DerivativesWe have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts, which are used to lock-in interest rates or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. We have used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities.Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these derivatives. As of December 31, 2015, we recorded a net liability of $69.0, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swaps' fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $655.2 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $655.2 increase in fair value.We also utilize put and call options on the S&P 500 index to hedge, on an economic basis, the exposure of our equity security portfolio to fluctuations in the equity markets. While the impact of fluctuations in the equity markets on these derivatives are largely offset by changes in the fair values of our equity security portfolio, the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized immediately in our income statement, whereas the change in fair value of our equity securities is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Accordingly, a decrease in the S&P 500 index of 10% would result in an approximate increase of $24.3 in the fair value of these derivatives. An increase in the S&P 500 index of 10% would result in an approximate decrease of $23.7 in the fair value of these derivatives.For additional information regarding our derivatives, see Note 5, “Derivative Financial Instruments” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein) References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Anthem” or the “Company” refer to Anthem, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and, unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries.This Management's Discussion and Analysis, or MD&A, should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.OverviewWe manage our operations through three reportable segments: Commercial and Specialty Business, Government Business and Other. We regularly evaluate the appropriateness of our reportable segments, particularly in light of organizational changes, merger and acquisition activity and changing laws and regulations. As a result, these reportable segments may change in the future. Our Commercial and Specialty Business segment includes our Local Group, National Accounts, Individual and Specialty businesses. Business units in the Commercial and Specialty Business segment offer fully-insured health products; provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management, disease management, wellness programs and other administrative services; and provide an array of specialty and other insurance products and services such as dental, vision, life and disability insurance benefits, radiology benefit management and analytics-driven personal health care guidance.Our Government Business segment includes Medicare and Medicaid businesses, National Government Services, or NGS, and services provided to the federal government in connection with the Federal Employee Program, or FEP. Medicare business includes services such as Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and Medicare Supplement. Medicaid business includes our managed care alternatives through publicly funded health care programs, including Medicaid; Temporary Assistance for Needy Family, or TANF, programs; programs for seniors and people with disabilities, or SPD; programs for long-term services and support, or LTSS; Children’s Health Insurance Programs, or CHIP, and Medicaid expansion programs. NGS acts as a Medicare contractor for the federal government in several regions across the nation. Our Other segment includes other businesses that do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, guidance, as well as corporate expenses not allocated to the other reportable segments.Our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue comes from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. Administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, or where the fee is based on either processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized. Additionally, we earn administrative fee revenues from our Medicare processing business and from other health-related businesses including disease management programs. Other revenue includes miscellaneous income other than premium revenue and administrative fees.Our benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our fully-insured members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. While we offer a diversified mix of managed care products and services through our managed care plans, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products and services. Our managed care plans include: preferred provider organizations, or PPOs; health maintenance organizations, or HMOs; point-of-service plans, or POS plans; -45-traditional indemnity plans and other hybrid plans, including consumer-driven health plans, or CDHPs; and hospital only and limited benefit products. We classify certain claims-related costs as benefit expense to reflect costs incurred for our members’ traditional medical care, as well as those expenses which improve our members’ health and medical outcomes. These claims-related costs may be comprised of expenses incurred for: (i) medical management, including case and utilization management; (ii) health and wellness, including disease management services for such conditions as diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, congestive heart failure and asthma management and wellness initiatives like weight-loss programs and smoking cessation treatments; and (iii) clinical health policy. These types of claims-related costs are designed to ultimately lower our members’ cost of care. Our selling expense consists of external broker commission expenses, and generally varies with premium or membership volume. Our general and administrative expense consists of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels and thus, associated compensation expense. Other variable costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity.Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management and health and wellness programs. Several economic factors related to health care costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating health care costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers and any regulatory or market driven restrictions on our ability to obtain adequate premium rates to offset overall inflation in health care costs, including increases in unit costs and utilization resulting from the aging of the population and other demographics, as well as advances in medical technology, may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material impact on our results of operations. In March 2016, we filed a lawsuit against our vendor for pharmacy benefit management services, Express Scripts, Inc., or Express Scripts, seeking to recover damages for pharmacy pricing that is higher than competitive benchmark pricing and damages related to operational breaches, and seeking various declarations under the agreement between the parties. In April 2016, Express Scripts filed an answer to the lawsuit disputing our contractual claims and alleging various defenses and counterclaims. For additional information regarding this lawsuit, see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.On July 24, 2015, we and Cigna Corporation, or Cigna, announced that we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or Merger Agreement, dated as of July 23, 2015, by and among Anthem, Cigna and Anthem Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to which we will acquire all outstanding shares of Cigna, or the Acquisition. This Acquisition will further our goal of creating a premier health benefits company with critical diversification and scale to lead the transformation of health care delivery for consumers. Cigna is a global health services organization that delivers affordable and personalized products and services to customers through employer-based, government-sponsored and individual coverage arrangements. All of Cigna's products and services are provided exclusively by or through its operating subsidiaries, including Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, Cigna Health and Life Insurance Company, Life Insurance Company of North America and Cigna Life Insurance Company of New York. Such products and services include an integrated suite of health services, such as medical, dental, behavioral health, pharmacy, vision, supplemental benefits, and other related products including group life, accident and disability insurance. Cigna maintains sales capability in 30 countries and jurisdictions. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Cigna’s shareholders will receive $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 shares of our common stock for each Cigna common share outstanding. The value of the transaction is estimated to be approximately $53,000.0 based on the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on July 23, 2015. The final purchase price will be determined based on our closing stock price on the date of closing of the Acquisition. The combined company will reflect a pro forma equity ownership comprised of approximately 67% Anthem shareholders and approximately 33% Cigna shareholders. We expect to finance the cash portion of the Acquisition through available cash on -46-hand and the issuance of new debt. We are party to a bridge facility commitment letter and a joinder agreement with a group of lenders which provides up to $19,500.0 under a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan credit facility to finance the Acquisition in the event that we have not received proceeds from any combination of (i) senior unsecured term loans, (ii) common or preferred equity or equity-linked securities and/or (iii) senior unsecured notes in a public offering or private placement in an aggregate principal amount of at least $19,500.0 prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. In addition, in August 2015, we entered into a term loan facility which will provide up to $4,000.0 to finance a portion of the Acquisition. The commitment of the lenders to provide the bridge facility and the term loan facility is subject to several conditions, including the completion of the Acquisition. We expect that our pro forma debt-to-capital ratio will approximate 49% following the closing of the Acquisition and we are committed to deleveraging to the low 40% range approximately twenty-four months following the closing. We also expect to maintain our common stock dividend and we will maintain flexibility with our share repurchase program. The Acquisition is subject to certain state regulatory approvals, other standard closing conditions and customary approvals required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. For additional information, see ""Risk Factors"" included in Part I, Item 1A; and Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestiture - Pending Acquisition of Cigna Corporation"" included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In July 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, along with certain state attorneys general, filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, or District Court, seeking to block the Acquisition. Trial commenced in November 2016 and concluded in January 2017. On January 18, 2017, we provided notice to Cigna that we had elected to extend the termination date under the Merger Agreement from January 31, 2017 until April 30, 2017. On February 8, 2017, the District Court ruled in favor of the DOJ, and following our motion to expedite the appeal, which was granted on February 17, 2017, we promptly appealed the District Court's ruling to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, or the Appellate Court. On February 14, 2017, Cigna purported to terminate the Merger Agreement and commenced litigation against us in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or Delaware Court, seeking damages and a declaratory judgment that its purported termination of the Merger Agreement was lawful, among other claims. We believe Cigna’s allegations are without merit. Also on February 14, 2017, we initiated our own litigation against Cigna in the Delaware Court seeking a temporary restraining order to enjoin Cigna from terminating the Merger Agreement, specific performance compelling Cigna to comply with the Merger Agreement and damages. On February 15, 2017, the Delaware Court granted our motion for a temporary restraining order and issued an order enjoining Cigna from terminating the Merger Agreement. The temporary restraining order became effective immediately and will remain in place pending any further order from the Delaware Court. A hearing will be scheduled the week of April 10, 2017. We intend to vigorously defend the Acquisition in both the Circuit Court and the Delaware Court and remain committed to completing the Acquisition as soon as practicable. If the Merger Agreement is terminated because the required regulatory approvals cannot be obtained, under certain conditions, we could be obligated to pay a $1,850.0 termination fee to Cigna. On February 17, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Simply Healthcare Holdings, Inc., or Simply Healthcare, a leading managed care company for people enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare programs in the state of Florida. This acquisition aligns with our strategy for continued growth in our Government Business segment. For additional information about this acquisition, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestiture - Acquisition of Simply Healthcare"" included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The future results of our operations will also be impacted by certain external forces and resulting changes in our business model and strategy. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, as well as the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, Health Care Reform, became law, causing significant changes to the U.S. health care system. Since then, significant regulations have been enacted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury. The legislation and regulations are far-reaching and are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage over time by mandating that most individuals obtain health insurance coverage, increasing the eligibility thresholds for most state Medicaid programs and providing certain individuals and small businesses with tax credits to subsidize a portion of the cost of health insurance coverage. As a result of the complexity of the law, its impact on health care in the United States, the continuing modification and interpretation of Health Care Reform rules and the potential for significant future changes to the law, we continue to analyze and refine our estimates of the ultimate impact of Health Care Reform on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Health Care Reform presented us with new growth opportunities, but also introduced new risks, regulatory challenges and uncertainties, and required changes in the way products are designed, underwritten, priced, distributed and administered. Changes to our business are likely to continue for the next several years as elected officials at the national and state level have proposed significant modification to existing laws and regulations, including the potential repeal or -47-replacement of Health Care Reform. For additional discussion, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Regulation,” and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Pricing in our Commercial and Specialty Business segment, including our Individual and Small Group lines of business, remains competitive and we strive to price our health care benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends. We believe our pricing strategy, based on predictive modeling, proprietary research and data-driven processes have positioned us to benefit from the potential growth opportunities available in fully-insured commercial products as a result of Health Care Reform and any subsequent changes to the current regulatory scheme. In the Individual and Small Group markets, we offer on-exchange products through state or federally facilitated marketplaces, referred to as public exchanges, and off-exchange products. Federal premium subsidies are available for certain members, subject to income and family size, who purchase public exchange products. We believe that our pricing strategy, brand name and network quality will provide a strong foundation for commercial risk membership growth opportunities in the future. In our Individual markets we offer bronze, silver and gold products, both on and off the public exchanges, in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. Additionally, we offer platinum products, both on and off the public exchanges, in California and New York. In our Small Group markets, we offer bronze, silver and gold products, off the public exchanges, in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. We offer platinum products, off the public exchanges, in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, New York, Virginia and Wisconsin. We offer bronze, silver and gold products, on the public exchanges, in Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio and Virginia. Additionally, we offer platinum products on the public exchange in Connecticut.Private exchanges have gained visibility in the marketplace based on the promise of helping employers reduce costs, increase consumer engagement and manage the complexities created by the ACA and other market forces. While private exchanges have been a distribution channel in the Medicare and Individual markets for some time, in more recent years the Commercial market has received an increased level of attention from the consulting and broker communities as well as health insurance carriers. In response, we have continued our broad-based strategy of offering Anthem Health Marketplace's consumer experience platform to groups, while also participating in four large national consultant-led exchanges, several regional broker-led exchanges and various Individual, Commercial and Medicare exchanges. To date, adoption levels in the Commercial market overall have been lower than analyst predictions. While the ultimate volume, pace of growth and winning business models remain highly uncertain in this space, we continue to believe we are well positioned to adapt with the market as it evolves. Health Care Reform imposes regulations on the health insurance sector, including, but not limited to, guaranteed coverage and expanded benefit requirements; prohibitions on some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to our members; increased restrictions on rescinding coverage; establishment of minimum medical loss ratio, or MLR, and customer rebate requirements; establishment of a mandatory annual Health Insurance Provider Fee, or HIP Fee; creation of a federal rate review process; a requirement to cover preventive services on a first dollar basis; the establishment of public exchanges and essential benefit packages and greater limitations on how we price certain of our products. In addition, the legislation reduces the reimbursement levels for our health plans participating in the Medicare Advantage program over time and limits the amount of executive compensation that is deductible for income tax purposes.As a result of Health Care Reform, HHS issued MLR regulations that require us to meet minimum MLR thresholds for Large Group, Small Group and Individual lines of business. Plans that do not meet the minimum thresholds will have to pay a MLR rebate. For purposes of determining MLR rebates, HHS has defined the types of costs that should be included in the MLR rebate calculation. However, certain components of the MLR calculation as defined by HHS cannot be classified consistently under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. While considered benefit expense or a reduction of premium revenue by HHS, certain of these costs are classified as other types of expense, such as income tax expense or general and administrative expense, in our GAAP basis financial statements. Accordingly, the benefit expense ratio determined using our consolidated GAAP operating results is not comparable to the MLR calculated under HHS regulations. Health Care Reform also imposed a separate minimum MLR threshold of 85% for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans beginning in 2014. Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D plans that do not meet this threshold will have to pay a minimum MLR rebate. If a plan’s MLR is below 85% for three consecutive years beginning with 2014, enrollment will -48-be restricted. A Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D plan contract will be terminated if the plan's MLR is below 85% for five consecutive years. Beginning in 2014, Health Care Reform imposed an annual HIP Fee on health insurers that write certain types of health insurance on U.S. risks. The annual HIP Fee is allocated to health insurers based on the ratio of the amount of an insurer's net premium revenues written during the preceding calendar year to an adjusted amount of health insurance for all U.S. health risk for those certain lines of business written during the preceding calendar year. The HIP Fee is non-deductible for federal income tax purposes. The total amount collected from allocations to health insurers was $11,300.0 for each of 2016 and 2015 and $8,000.0 for 2014. We record our estimated liability for the HIP Fee in full at the beginning of the year with a corresponding deferred asset that is amortized on a straight-line basis to general and administrative expense. The final calculation and payment of the annual HIP Fee occurs in the third quarter each year and our portion of the HIP Fee for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $1,176.3, $1,207.5 and $893.3, respectively. The annual HIP Fee to be allocated to all health insurers has been suspended for 2017 and is scheduled to resume and be increased to $14,300.0 for 2018, without subsequent legislative or regulatory action. For 2019 and beyond, the annual HIP Fee will equal the amount for the preceding year increased by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year less the rate of growth in the consumer price index for the preceding calendar year.These and other provisions of Health Care Reform are likely to have significant effects on our future operations, which, in turn, could impact the value of our business model and results of operations, including potential impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets. We will continue to evaluate the impact of Health Care Reform including any substantial changes to existing laws or regulations that may impact our business. For additional discussion regarding Health Care Reform, see Part I, Item 1 “Business—Regulation” and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Finally, federal and state regulatory agencies may further restrict our ability to obtain new product approvals, implement changes in premium rates or impose additional restrictions, under new or existing laws that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.We are also subject to regulations that may result in assessments under state insurance guaranty association laws. The National Organization of Life & Health Insurance Guaranty Associations, or NOLHGA, is a voluntary organization consisting of the state life and health insurance guaranty associations located throughout the U.S. Such associations, working together with NOLHGA, provide a safety net for their state’s policyholders, ensuring that they continue to receive coverage, subject to state maximum limits, even if their insurer is declared insolvent. In 2009, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner placed Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary American Network Insurance Company, or collectively Penn Treaty, in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency. After failing to develop a viable rehabilitation plan, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner filed a petition to convert the rehabilitation to a liquidation, with the liquidation expected to commence following the coordination of certain scheduling matters. When Penn Treaty is placed in liquidation, we and other insurers will be obligated to pay a portion of their policyholder claims through state guaranty association assessments in future periods. At December 31, 2016, we estimate our portion of the assessments for the Penn Treaty insolvency will approximate $190.0 to $220.0. In accordance with FASB guidance, the ultimate amount of the assessments will be recognized as an expense in the period in which a court ordered liquidation is entered. Payment of the assessments will be largely recovered through premium billing surcharges and premium tax credits over future years. In addition to the external forces discussed in the preceding paragraphs, our results of operations are impacted by levels and mix of membership. In recent years, we have experienced membership growth due to the quality and pricing of our health benefits products and services, improved economic conditions, decreases in unemployment, acquisitions, entry into new markets and expansions in existing markets. In addition, we believe the self-insured portion of our group membership base will continue to increase as a percentage of total group membership. However, these membership trends could be negatively impacted by various factors that could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations such as general economic downturns that result in business failures, failure to obtain new customers or retain existing customers, premium increases, benefit changes or our exit from a specific market. Further, our mix of membership may include more individuals with a higher acuity level obtaining coverage through our products available on the public exchanges, which may not be appropriately adjusted for in our premium rates. -49-In February 2015, we reported that we were the target of a sophisticated external cyber attack. The attackers gained unauthorized access to certain of our information technology systems and obtained personal information related to many individuals and employees. We have continued to implement security enhancements since this incident. For additional information about the cyber attack, see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies - Cyber Attack Incident,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Also see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of the factors identified above and other risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time.Executive SummaryWe are one of the largest health benefits companies in the United States in terms of medical membership, serving 39.9 medical members through our affiliated health plans as of December 31, 2016. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or BCBS, licensee for Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (as BCBS in 10 New York City metropolitan and surrounding counties, and as Blue Cross or BCBS in selected upstate counties), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield or Empire Blue Cross (in our New York service areas). We also conduct business through arrangements with other BCBS licensees in South Carolina and Western New York. Through our AMERIGROUP Corporation, or Amerigroup, subsidiary, we conduct business in Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington. In addition, we conduct business through our Simply Healthcare Holdings, Inc., or Simply Healthcare, subsidiary in Florida. We also serve customers throughout the country as HealthLink, UniCare (including a non-risk arrangement with Massachusetts), and in certain Arizona, California, Nevada and Virginia markets through our CareMore Health Group, Inc., or CareMore, subsidiary. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states through our subsidiaries. On January 31, 2014, we sold our 1-800 CONTACTS, Inc. business and our glasses.com related assets, or collectively, 1-800 CONTACTS. The operating results for 1-800 CONTACTS for the one month ended January 31, 2014 are reported as discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of income included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These results were previously reported in the Commercial and Specialty Business segment. Unless otherwise specified, all financial information disclosed in this MD&A is from continuing operations, other than net income, diluted earnings per share and cash flows. In accordance with FASB guidance, we have elected to not separately disclose net cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities and the net effect of those cash flows on cash and cash equivalents for discontinued operations during the periods presented. For additional information regarding these transactions, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestiture - Divestiture of 1-800 CONTACTS,"" to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $84,194.0, an increase of $5,789.2, or 7.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in operating revenue was primarily a result of higher premium revenue in both our Government Business and Commercial and Specialty Business segments, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees in our Commercial and Specialty Business segment. These increases were partially offset by lower administrative fees in our Government Business segment. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2,469.8, a decrease of $90.2, or 3.5%, from the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net income was primarily due to lower operating results in our Government Business segment, an increase in transaction costs associated with our pending acquisition of Cigna, a decrease in net earnings from investment activities and an increase in interest expense. Our diluted earnings per share, or EPS, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $9.21, a decrease of $0.17, or 1.8%, from the year ended December 31, 2015. Our diluted shares for the year ended December 31, 2016 were 268.1, a decrease of 4.8, or 1.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in EPS resulted from the decrease in net income, partially offset by the impact of a lower number of shares outstanding in 2016.-50-Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3,204.5, or 1.3 times net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $4,116.0, or 1.6 times net income. The decrease in operating cash flow from 2015 of $911.5 was primarily attributable to an increase in claims payments due to higher medical cost experience and growth in membership. The decrease was further due to the timing of claim reimbursements from our self-insured customers. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in premium receipts as a result of rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and growth in membership. The decrease was further offset by an increase in pharmacy rebates received.Our results of operations discussed throughout this MD&A are determined in accordance with GAAP. We also calculate operating revenue and operating gain to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results and comparing them among periods. We define operating revenue as premium income, administrative fees and other revenues. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, and selling, general and administrative expense. We use these measures as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, forecasting future operating performance and setting incentive compensation targets. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income before income tax expense, net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional details on operating gain, see our “Reportable Segments Results of Operations” discussion included in this MD&A. For a reconciliation of reportable segment operating revenue to the amounts of total revenue included in the consolidated statements of income and a reconciliation of reportable segment operating gain to income from continuing operations before income tax expense, see Note 19, ""Segment Information,"" to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We intend to expand through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions, including the pending acquisition of Cigna, and efficient use of capital in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. While we have achieved strong growth as a result of strategic mergers and acquisitions, we have also achieved organic growth in our existing markets over time by delivering excellent service, offering competitively priced products, providing access to high quality provider networks and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks.Significant TransactionsWhile Health Care Reform has caused significant changes to the U.S. health care system in recent years, the significant transactions that have occurred over the last three years that have impacted or will impact our capital structure or that have or will influence how we conduct our business operations include:•Pending acquisition of Cigna;•Acquisition of Simply Healthcare (2015);•Board of Directors declaration of dividends on common stock (2014 through February 2017); authorization for repurchases of our common stock (2017 and prior); and debt repurchases and new debt issuance (2015 and prior); and•Divestiture of 1-800 CONTACTS (2014).For additional information regarding these transactions, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestiture,” Note 12, ""Debt"" and Note 14, “Capital Stock,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.-51-MembershipOur medical membership includes seven different customer types: Local Group, Individual, National Accounts, BlueCard®, Medicare, Medicaid and FEP. BCBS-branded business generally refers to members in our service areas licensed by the BCBSA. Non-BCBS-branded business refers to Amerigroup, CareMore and Simply Healthcare members as well as HealthLink and UniCare members predominantly outside of our BCBSA service areas.•Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. In addition, Local Group includes UniCare members and Employer Group Medicare Advantage members, or retired members of Local Group accounts who have selected a Medicare Advantage product. Local Group accounts are generally sold through brokers or consultants working with industry specialists from our in-house sales force and are offered both on and off the public exchanges. Local Group insurance premiums may be based on claims incurred by the group or sold on a self-insured basis. The customer’s buying decision is typically based upon the size and breadth of our networks, customer service, the quality of our medical management services, the administrative cost included in our quoted price, our financial stability, reputation and our ability to effectively service large complex accounts. Local Group accounted for 38.7%, 39.5% and 40.4% of our medical members at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.•Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. Individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, retail partnerships, our in-house sales force or via the Internet. Individual business is sold on a fully-insured basis. We offer on-exchange products through public exchanges and off-exchange products. Federal premium subsidies are available only for certain public exchange Individual products. Individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network, and the efficiency of administration. Customer turnover is generally higher with Individual as compared to Local Group. Individual business accounted for 4.2%, 4.3% and 4.8% of our medical members at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.•National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in an Anthem service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker and consultant relationships. Service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. National Accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. We believe we have an advantage when competing for very large National Accounts due to the size and breadth of our networks and our ability to access the national provider networks of BCBS companies at their competitive local market rates. In addition, Employer Group Medicare Advantage members related to National Accounts groups are reported as part of National Accounts membership. The Employer Group Medicare Advantage members represent less than 1.0% of National Accounts membership. National Accounts represented 19.4%, 19.1% and 19.1% of our medical members at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.•BlueCard® host customers represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by Anthem who receive health care services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard® membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard® program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which an Anthem subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-Anthem controlled BCBSA licensee (i.e., the “home plan”). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard® members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard® members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard® claims received per month. BlueCard® host membership accounted for 13.9%, 14.0% and 14.1% of our medical members at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.•Medicare customers are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a managed care alternative for the Medicare program, who have purchased Medicare Supplement benefit coverage, some disabled members under age 65, or members of all ages with end stage renal disease. We also include in the Medicare category members enrolled in our dual eligible Medicare-Medicaid Plans, or MMPs, in the states where we participate. Medicare Supplement policies are sold to Medicare recipients as supplements to the benefits they receive from the Medicare program. Rates are filed with and in some cases approved by state insurance -52-departments. Most of the premium for Medicare Advantage is paid directly by the federal government on behalf of the participant who may also be charged a small premium. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. Medicare business accounted for 3.6%, 3.7% and 3.7% of our medical members at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.•Medicaid membership represents eligible members who receive health care benefits through publicly funded health care programs, including Medicaid, TANF, SPD, LTSS, CHIP and Medicaid expansion programs. Total Medicaid program business accounted for 16.4%, 15.3% and 13.8% of our medical members at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.•FEP members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. FEP business accounted for 3.9%, 4.1% and 4.1% of our medical members at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two principal funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some self-funded customers choose to purchase stop loss coverage to limit their retained risk.-53-The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Also included below is other membership by product. The medical membership and other membership presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

The increase was partially offset by attrition in our fully-insured product offerings resulting from competitive pressures and conversions to self-funded ASO contracts.Individual membership decreased 11, or 0.7%, primarily due to attrition in non-ACA-compliant product offerings, partially offset by growth in ACA-compliant off- and on-exchange product offerings.National Accounts membership increased 386, or 5.2%, primarily due to the implementation of new large multi-state employer group contracts and expansion in existing employer group accounts. BlueCard® membership increased 143, or 2.6%, primarily due to higher membership activity at other BCBSA plans whose members reside in or travel to our licensed areas.Medicare membership decreased 1, or 0.1%, primarily due to membership losses from strategic market exits, partially offset by growth in certain existing markets.Medicaid membership increased 613, or 10.4%, primarily due to new business expansions and organic growth in existing markets.FEP membership increased 2, or 0.1%, primarily due to higher sales during the open enrollment period.Other Membership (in thousands)Our Other products are often ancillary to our health business and can therefore be impacted by corresponding changes in our medical membership.Life and disability membership decreased 117, or 2.4%, primarily due to higher lapses in our fully-insured Local Group business.Dental membership increased 280, or 5.4%, primarily due to new sales and growth in our Local Group and ACA-compliant Individual product offerings.Dental administration membership increased 12, or 0.2%, primarily due to membership expansion under current contracts.Vision membership increased 747, or 13.2%, primarily due to growth in our Local Group, National accounts and ACA-compliant Individual product offerings.Medicare Advantage Part D membership increased 7, or 1.1%, primarily due to higher sales during the open enrollment period.Medicare Part D standalone membership decreased 21, or 5.7%, primarily due to our product repositioning strategies and select strategic actions in certain markets.December 31, 2015 Compared to December 31, 2014 Medical Membership (in thousands)During the year ended December 31, 2015, total medical membership increased 1,100, or 2.9%, primarily due to increases in our Medicaid, National Accounts, BlueCard® and Local Group membership, partially offset by decreases in our Individual membership.Self-funded medical membership increased 866, or 3.8%, primarily due to increases in our Local Group self-funded accounts as a result of new sales and conversions of fully-insured contracts to self-funded ASO contracts, and growth in our National Accounts and BlueCard® membership.-55-Fully-insured membership increased 234, or 1.6%, primarily due to growth in our Medicaid and Medicare businesses including membership acquired with the acquisition of Simply Healthcare, and increased sales in our Individual business ACA-compliant on- and off-exchange product offerings. These increases were partially offset by Local Group fully-insured membership declines, largely driven by conversions of fully-insured contracts to self-funded ASO contracts and our decision to exit the Georgia employer group Medicare product offering. The increase was further offset by attrition in our Individual business non-ACA-compliant product offerings.Local Group membership increased 104, or 0.7%, primarily due to increases in our self-funded accounts. The increase in membership was partially offset by attrition in our Small Group line of business resulting from product mix changes as members moved into Health Care Reform product offerings and competitive pressures. The increase was further offset by fully-insured membership declines resulting from our decision to exit the Georgia employer group Medicare product offering.Individual membership decreased 118, or 6.6%, primarily due to attrition in non-ACA-compliant product offerings, partially offset by increased sales in ACA-compliant on- and off-exchange product offerings.National Accounts membership increased 200, or 2.8%, primarily due to new sales and in-group change.BlueCard® membership increased 128, or 2.4%, primarily due to favorable membership activity at other BCBSA plans whose members reside in or travel to our licensed areas.Medicare membership increased 35, or 2.5%, primarily due to membership acquired through the acquisition of Simply Healthcare and growth in our MMPs primarily due to commencement of operations in new dual eligible markets.Medicaid membership increased 721, or 13.9%, primarily due to commencement of operations in new markets including membership acquired through the acquisition of Simply Healthcare, and growth through Health Care Reform expansions.FEP membership increased 30, or 2.0%, primarily due to higher sales during open enrollment. Other Membership (in thousands)Our Other products are often ancillary to our health business and can therefore be impacted by corresponding changes in our medical membership.Life and disability membership increased 87, or 1.8%, primarily due to growth and higher sales in our Local Group business.Dental membership increased 211, or 4.2%, primarily due to new sales and growth in our Local Group and Individual businesses, partially offset by attrition in our off-exchange Local Group and Individual business product offerings.Dental administration membership increased 364, or 7.4%, primarily due to the acquisition of a large managed dental contract pursuant to which we provide dental administrative services.Vision membership increased 545, or 10.7%, primarily due to increased sales and penetration in our Medicare business, and growth in our Local Group, National Accounts and Individual businesses. These increases were partially offset by attrition in our off-exchange Local Group and Individual business product offerings.Medicare Advantage Part D membership decreased 68, or 9.9%, primarily due to membership declines resulting from our decision to exit the Georgia employer group Medicare product offering, partially offset by commencement of operations in new dual eligible markets and membership acquired through the acquisition of Simply Healthcare.Medicare Part D standalone membership decreased 96, or 20.6%, primarily due to our product repositioning strategies and select strategic actions in certain markets.-56-Cost of Care The following discussion summarizes our aggregate underlying cost of care trends for the year ended December 31, 2016 for our Local Group fully-insured business only.Our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing the year-over-year change in average per member per month claim costs. While our cost of care trend varies by geographic location, based on underlying medical cost trends, we estimate that our aggregate cost of care trend was in the lower end of the 7.0% to 7.5% range for the full year of 2016. We anticipate that medical cost trends will be in the range of 6.5% to 7.0% in 2017.Outpatient and professional utilization have been consistent with prior years. Inpatient and pharmacy utilization have been lower than in prior years. Consistent with prior years, provider rate increases were a primary driver of medical cost trends. We continually negotiate with hospitals and physicians to manage these cost trends. We commonly negotiate multi-year contracts with hospitals and physicians, minimizing annual fluctuations in medical cost trend. We remain committed to optimizing our reimbursement rates and strategies to help address the cost pressures faced by employers and consumers. Unit cost increases, as well as increases in high cost specialty drug offerings and usage, were also a driver of pharmacy cost. For example, high cost Hepatitis C drug therapies continued to put upward pressure on pharmacy trend. We have negotiated to lower the cost of these Hepatitis C drug therapies and continue to review clinical appropriateness of these new Hepatitis C drug therapies to ensure members receive the most appropriate treatment and length of therapy. In response to cost trends, we continue to pursue contracting and plan design changes, promote and implement performance-based contracts that reward clinical outcomes and quality, and expand care management programs. We are taking a leadership role in the area of payment reform as evidenced by our Enhanced Personal Health Care program. By establishing the primary care doctor as central to the coordination of a patient’s health care needs, the initiative builds on the success of current patient-centered medical home programs in helping to improve patient care while lowering costs.A number of clinical management initiatives are in place to help mitigate inpatient trend. Focused review efforts continue in key areas, including targeting outlier facilities for length of stay and readmission, and high risk maternity and neonatal intensive care unit cases, as noted below. Additionally, we continue to refine our programs related to readmission management, focused behavioral health readmission reduction and post-discharge follow-up care.•Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Focused Review - Collaborative teams focus on developing a comprehensive plan of care and safe and effective discharge planning so that individuals can be released from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit as soon as medically appropriate.Outpatient costs are a collection of different types of expenses, such as outpatient facilities, labs, x-rays, emergency room, occupational and physical therapy and many others. Example programs developed to mitigate outpatient costs are as follows:•Cancer Care Quality Program - This program, developed in collaboration with our subsidiary AIM Specialty Health, identifies certain cancer treatment pathways selected based upon current medical evidence, peer-reviewed published literature, consensus guidelines and our clinical policies to support oncologists in identifying cancer treatment therapies that are highly effective and provide greater value.•Avoidable Emergency Room Visits - This program seeks to help educate members and providers about potentially avoidable emergency room visits. Phone calls and mailings are used to inform members of alternate sites of care, such as primary care physicians, urgent care facilities, and walk-in doctor’s offices that can replace visits to the emergency room in certain situations. •Specialty Drug Site of Care - This program, when clinically appropriate and safe, uses clinical site of care review to encourage utilization of certain specialty drugs in more effective settings such as physician offices, ambulatory infusion suites and in the home using home infusion therapy.•Fraud and Abuse - This program, through investigation and identification of providers with an invalid medical license and/or expired prescribing privileges, seeks to prevent improper payment of medical or pharmacy claims.-57-Consolidated Results of OperationsOur consolidated summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are discussed in the following section.

Premiums for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $78,860.1, $73,385.1 and $68,389.8, respectively. Premiums are included in total operating revenue presented above.5bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%.6Selling, general and administrative expense ratio represents selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total operating revenue.-58-Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Total operating revenue increased $5,789.2, or 7.4%, to $84,194.0 in 2016, resulting primarily from higher premiums, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees. Higher premiums were largely due to rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends. The increase was further attributable to membership increases in our Medicaid and ACA-compliant off- and on-exchange Individual business product offerings. Additionally, adjustments to accruals for the Health Care Reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program and increased reimbursed benefit utilization in our FEP business contributed to the increase in premiums. The increase in premiums was partially offset by the declines in fully-insured membership in our Small Group business and lapses in non-ACA-compliant Individual business product offerings. The increase in administrative fees primarily resulted from membership growth and rate increases for self-funded members in our National Accounts and Large Group businesses.Net investment income increased $101.9, or 15.0%, to $779.5 in 2016, primarily due to higher income from alternative investments.Net realized gains on financial instruments decreased $152.6, or 96.9%, to $4.9 in 2016, primarily due to an increase in net realized losses on derivative financial instruments, largely as a result of losses recognized on options entered in to economically hedge the variability of cash flows in the interest payments on anticipated future financings. The decrease was further due to lower net realized gains on sales of equity securities. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net realized gains on sales of fixed maturity securities.Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments increased $32.0, or 38.4%, to $115.4 in 2016, primarily due to an increase in impairment losses on fixed maturity securities, partially offset by a decrease in impairment losses on equity securities.Benefit expense increased $5,717.5, or 9.4%, to $66,834.4 in 2016, primarily due to increased costs as a result of overall cost trends across our businesses. The increase was further attributable to membership growth in our Medicaid business and ACA-compliant off- and on-exchange Individual business product offerings. These increases were partially offset by the declines in fully-insured membership in our Small Group business and non-ACA-compliant Individual business product offerings. Our benefit expense ratio increased 150 basis points to 84.8% in 2016. The increase in the ratio was largely driven by our Medicaid business due to increases in medical cost experience that exceeded the impact of premium rate adjustments, higher than expected medical cost experience in the Iowa market, which we began serving in 2016, and increases in membership as our Medicaid business has a higher benefit expense ratio than our consolidated average. The increase in the ratio was further due to higher medical costs experience in our Individual and Local Group businesses. These increases were partially offset by adjustments to estimates of prior year accruals related to the Health Care Reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program and improved medical cost performance in our Medicare business.Selling, general and administrative expense was $12,557.9 and $12,534.8 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 110 basis points to 14.9% in 2016. The decrease in the ratio was primarily a result of lower costs related to expense efficiency initiatives and the increase in operating revenue, including the impact of Medicaid membership growth in our Government Business segment, which has a lower selling, general and administrative expense ratio than our consolidated average.Other expense increased $41.5, or 4.7%, to $915.3 in 2016, primarily due to higher interest expense in 2016 driven by amortization of the fees incurred for the bridge facility commitment letter and joinder agreement entered into during the third quarter of 2015 to partially fund the pending acquisition of Cigna. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets.Income tax expense increased $14.6, or 0.7%, to $2,085.6 in 2016. The effective tax rates in 2016 and 2015 were 45.8% and 44.7%, respectively. The increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in non-deductible costs incurred associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna and the increase in our California deferred state tax expense resulting from recent California legislation related to Managed Care Organizations. The increase was further due to favorable 2015 tax adjustments related to state audit settlements. These increases were partially offset by the -59-non-recurring impact of an adverse California franchise tax ruling recognized in 2015 and a decrease in income before income tax expense. Our net income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 30 basis points to 2.9% in 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of all factors discussed above.Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Total operating revenue increased $5,383.1, or 7.4% to $78,404.8 in 2015, resulting primarily from higher premiums, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees. Higher premiums were mainly due to membership increases across our Government Business segment, including membership obtained through the acquisition of Simply Healthcare, and rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and the increase in the HIP Fee. The increase in premiums was further attributable to membership increases in our ACA-compliant on- and off-exchange Individual business product offerings and refinement of estimates associated with Medicare risk score revenue in the prior year. The increase in premiums was offset, in part, by the fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business, attrition in non-ACA-compliant Individual business product offerings and adjustments to accruals for the Health Care Reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program. The increase in administrative fees primarily resulted from rate increases and membership growth for self-funded members in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses.Net investment income decreased $46.8, or 6.5%, to $677.6 in 2015, primarily due to lower income from alternative investments, partially offset by higher investment yields on fixed maturity securities. Net realized gains on financial instruments decreased $19.5, or 11.0%, to $157.5 in 2015, primarily due to an increase in net realized losses on sales of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by an increase in net realized gains on sales of equity securities and settlements of derivative financial instruments.Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments increased $34.4, or 70.2%, to $83.4 in 2015, primarily due to an increase in impairment losses on equity and fixed maturity securities.Benefit expense increased $4,262.0, or 7.5%, to $61,116.9 in 2015, primarily due to increase in overall cost trends across our businesses, membership growth across our Government Business segment, including membership obtained through the acquisition of Simply Healthcare, and membership growth in our ACA-compliant on- and off-exchange Individual business product offerings. These increases were partially offset by the fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business and non-ACA-compliant Individual business product offerings, as described above.Our benefit expense ratio increased 20 basis points to 83.3% in 2015, largely driven by changes in the mix of the product portfolio, higher than expected medical costs in our Individual business, and adjustments to accruals related to the Health Care Reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program. These increases were partially offset by improvement in our Local Group business and certain Medicare lines of business predominantly due to improved medical cost performance. The increase in the ratio was further offset by refinement of estimates associated with Medicare risk score revenue in the prior year.Selling, general and administrative expense increased $786.4, or 6.7%, to $12,534.8 in 2015. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 10 basis points to 16.0% in 2015. The increase in the expense was primarily due to increased associate costs to support our growth in membership. The increase in expense was further due to net increases in Health Care Reform fees, primarily due to an increase in the HIP Fee of $314.2, and increased premium taxes as a result of the growth in premiums. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in assessments related to the Health Care Reform reinsurance premium stabilization program of $163.4. The decrease in the ratio was primarily due to the impact of Medicaid membership growth in our Government Business segment, which has a lower selling, general and administrative expense ratio than our consolidated average. Other expense decreased $28.9, or 3.2%, to $873.8 in 2015, primarily due to changes in gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized net gains on extinguishment of debt of $9.3 compared to net losses on extinguishment of debt of $81.1 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in other expense was partially offset by higher interest expense in 2015 driven by higher outstanding debt balances and the amortization of fees incurred for the obtainment of the bridge facility commitment letter and joinder agreement to partially -60-fund the pending acquisition of Cigna. The decrease in other expense was further offset by an increase in amortization of intangible assets. For additional information related to our borrowings, see ""Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt,"" below.Income tax expense increased $263.0, or 14.5%, to $2,071.0 in 2015. The effective tax rates in 2015 and 2014 were 44.7% and 41.4%, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the increase of the non-tax deductible HIP Fee, increased income before income taxes and increased state tax expense as a result of an adverse California franchise tax ruling. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2015 was primarily due to the increase in the non-tax deductible HIP fee and the state tax impact of the adverse California franchise tax ruling. Our net income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 30 basis points to 3.2% in 2015 as compared to 2014 as a result of all factors discussed above. Reportable Segments Results of OperationsWe use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, which are Commercial and Specialty Business; Government Business; and Other. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense and selling, general and administrative expense. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains on financial instruments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. The discussion of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional information, see Note 19, “Segment Information,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our Commercial and Specialty Business, Government Business, and Other segments’ summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows: Change Years Ended December 31 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 2016 2015 2014 $ % $ %Commercial and Specialty Business Operating revenue$38,692.1 $37,570.8 $39,199.6 $1,121.3 3.0 % $(1,628.8) (4.2)%Operating gain$3,195.2 $2,854.0 $3,260.9 $341.2 12.0 % $(406.9) (12.5)%Operating margin8.3% 7.6% 8.3% 70bp (70)bpGovernment Business Operating revenue$45,477.7 $40,813.0 $33,796.4 $4,664.7 11.4 % $7,016.6 20.8 %Operating gain$1,784.3 $1,978.5 $1,191.9 $(194.2) (9.8)% $786.6 66.0 %Operating margin3.9% 4.8% 3.5% (90)bp 130bpOther Operating revenue1$24.2 $21.0 $25.7 $3.2 15.2 % $(4.7) (18.3)%Operating loss2$(177.8) $(79.4) $(34.4) $(98.4) 123.9 % $(45.0) 130.8 % 1Fluctuations not material.2Fluctuations are primarily a result of changes in unallocated corporate expenses. The increases in 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to transaction costs associated with our pending acquisition of Cigna.-61-Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Commercial and Specialty BusinessOperating revenue increased $1,121.3, or 3.0%, to $38,692.1 in 2016, primarily due to premium rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends in our Local Group and Individual businesses. The increase was further attributable to adjustments to accruals for the Health Care Reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program, membership growth in our ACA-compliant off- and on-exchange Individual business product offerings and increased administrative fees. The increase in administrative fees was primarily due to membership growth and rate increases for self-funded members in our National Accounts and self-funded Large Group businesses. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by declines in fully-insured membership in our Small Group business and lapses in non-ACA-compliant Individual business product offerings.Operating gain increased $341.2, or 12.0%, to $3,195.2 in 2016, primarily due to adjustments to accruals for the Health Care Reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program and lower selling, general and administrative expense related to expense efficiency initiatives. The increase was further attributable to membership growth in our National Accounts and self-funded Large Group businesses. These increases were partially offset by higher medical cost experience in our Individual and Local Group businesses and decreases in fully-insured Small Group membership.The operating margin in 2016 was 8.3%, a 70 basis point increase over 2015, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.Government BusinessOperating revenue increased $4,664.7, or 11.4%, to $45,477.7 in 2016. The increase in operating revenue was primarily due to increased premiums in our Medicaid business as a result of membership growth through new business expansions and organic growth in existing markets. The increase in operating revenue was also due to rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends in our Medicaid and Medicare businesses and increased premiums in our FEP business, due to increased reimbursed benefit utilization. Operating gain decreased $194.2, or 9.8%, to $1,784.3 in 2016, primarily due to increases in medical cost experience in our Medicaid business that exceeded the impact of premium rate adjustments and higher than expected medical cost experience in the Iowa Medicaid market, which we began serving in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expense related to expense efficiency initiatives, improved medical cost performance in our Medicare business and the favorable impact of a retroactive change in the minimum MLR calculation under California's Medicaid expansion program.The operating margin in 2016 was 3.9%, a 90 basis point decrease from 2015, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Commercial and Specialty BusinessOperating revenue decreased $1,628.8, or 4.2%, to $37,570.8 in 2015, due in part to fully-insured membership declines in our Large Group business largely driven by the discontinuation of our Georgia employer group Medicare product offering. The decrease in operating revenue was further attributable to attrition in our Small Group line of business resulting from both product mix changes as members moved into Health Care Reform product offerings and competitive pressures. Additionally, operating revenue decreased as a result of attrition in non-ACA-compliant Individual business product offerings and adjustments to accruals for the Health Care Reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program. These decreases were partially offset by premium rate increases in our Individual and Local Group lines of business designed to cover overall cost trends and the increase in the HIP Fee. The decrease in operating revenue was further offset by membership growth in our ACA-compliant on- and off-exchange Individual business product offerings and increased administrative fees. The increase in administrative fees was primarily attributable to membership growth and rate increases for self-funded members in our Large Group and National Accounts businesses.-62-Operating gain decreased $406.9, or 12.5%, to $2,854.0 in 2015, primarily due to higher than expected medical costs in our Individual business, membership declines in our fully-insured Local Group and Individual lines of business and adjustments to accruals for the Health Care Reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in operating gain in our Local Group business primarily due to improved medical cost performance. The increase in operating gain was further offset by increases in self-funded membership in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses. The operating margin in 2015 was 7.6%, a 70 basis point decrease from 2014, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Government BusinessOperating revenue increased $7,016.6, or 20.8%, to $40,813 in 2015. The increase in operating revenue was primarily due to increased premiums in our Medicaid business as a result of membership growth through commencement of operations in new markets including membership obtained through the acquisition of Simply Healthcare, membership growth through Health Care Reform expansions and membership growth in existing markets. The increase in Medicaid premiums was further due to rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends and the increase in the HIP Fee. The increase in operating revenue was further attributable to premium increases in our Medicare business as a result of rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends, the acquisition of Simply Healthcare and refinement of estimates associated with Medicare risk score revenue in the prior year. Finally, increased premiums in our FEP business primarily due to increased benefit utilization contributed to the increase in operating revenue. Operating gain increased $786.6, or 66.0%, to $1,978.5 in 2015, primarily due to membership growth and improved medical cost performance in certain markets in our Medicaid and Medicare business, and refinement of estimates associated with Medicare risk score revenue in the prior year that did not recur in the current year. The increase in operating gain was further attributable to higher reimbursements for the non-tax deductible portion of the HIP Fee. These increases were partially offset by higher administrative costs to support our growth in membership. The operating margin in 2015 was 4.8%, a 130 basis point increase over 2014, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider our most important accounting policies that require significant estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our other significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances.Medical Claims Payable The most subjective accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2016, this liability was $7,892.6 and represented 19.7% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 96.5%, or $7,619.9, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2016; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 3.5%, or $272.7, of the total medical claims payable as of December 31, 2016. The level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period end to the next, from approximately 1% to 5% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made.-63-Liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be appropriate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or “trend factors.” Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison of prior year, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense.We regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable.While there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid claims liability as of December 31, 2016 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations.There is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through twelve months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. In our analysis for the claim liabilities at December 31, 2016, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 40 and 90 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower variability ranging from 0 to 30 basis points.The difference in completion factor assumptions, assuming moderately adverse experience, results in variability of 2%, or approximately $178.0, in the December 31, 2016 incurred but not paid claims liability, depending on the completion -64-factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein.The other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2016 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. In our analysis for the period ended December 31, 2016, there was a 320 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors assuming moderately adverse experience. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 5%, or approximately $359.0, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factors used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claims liability at December 31, 2016. See Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year.” Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. The ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 89.1% for both 2016 and 2015 and 89.4% for 2014. This ratio serves as an indicator of claims processing speed whereby claims were processed at the same speed in 2016 and 2015. The decrease in the ratio in 2015 from 2014 reflects a decrease in claims processing speed.We calculate the percentage of prior years’ redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior years' net incurred claims payable less prior years’ redundancies in the current year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior years’ reserves. This metric was 14.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016, 15.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 9.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The year ended December 31, 2016 metric reflects a slightly lower level of conservatism than the metric for the year ended December 31, 2015. The year ended December 31, 2015 metric reflects a higher level of conservatism than the metric for year ended December 31, 2014.We calculate the percentage of prior years’ redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior years’ net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation supports the reasonableness of our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims and the consistency in our methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2016, this metric was 1.4%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $850.4. This metric was 1.4% for 2015 and 1.0% for 2014.The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for each of 2015 and 2014 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims – current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims – prior years redundancies” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 2015 2014Total net incurred medical claims, as reported$59,908.2 $55,763.9Retrospective basis, as described above59,858.0 55,505.6Variance$50.2 $258.3Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported0.1% 0.5%-65-Given that our business is primarily short tailed (which means that medical claims are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider), the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2016 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2017.The 2015 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of 0.1% was lower than the 2014 percentage of 0.5%. The lower 2015 variance was driven by a higher level of incurred claims recognized in 2015 as compared to 2014, with an approximately similar level of prior year redundancies recognized in each of the subsequent years. Income TaxesWe account for income taxes in accordance with FASB guidance, which requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance.At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following:•the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset;•the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim;•the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and•any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences.We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits, as required by the guidance. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted.In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we intend to defend our positions vigorously through the federal, state and local appeals processes. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact on our results of operations from these matters.For additional information, see Note 7, “Income Taxes,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsOur consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2016 was $17,561.2 and other intangible assets were $7,964.9. The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets represented 39.2% of our total consolidated assets and 101.7% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2016.We follow FASB guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test. -66-Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, which include goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately.We complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. These tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Certain interim impairment tests are also performed when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur.Fair value is estimated using the income and market approaches for goodwill at the reporting unit level and the income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. Use of the income and market approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. The income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. These estimated future cash flows are then discounted. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted-average cost of capital. Market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including revenue, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), and book value of invested capital (debt and equity) and include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry.We did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2016 annual impairment tests as the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying values as of December 31, 2016. Additionally, we do not believe that the estimated fair values of our reporting units are at risk of becoming impaired in the next twelve months. However, as a result of certain provisions of Health Care Reform, along with current economic conditions, we have experienced lower operating margins in certain lines of business. Those margins could become further compressed with adverse changes in federal and state laws and regulations. As a result, the estimated fair values of certain of our reporting units with goodwill could fall below their carrying values in future periods and if that were to occur, we would be required to record impairment losses at that time.While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.For additional information, see Note 3, ""Business Acquisitions and Divestiture"" and Note 9, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Investments Current and long-term available-for-sale investment securities were $19,187.4 at December 31, 2016 and represented 29.5% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2016. We classify fixed maturity and equity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” or “trading” and report those securities at fair value. Certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity.We review investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. In addition, for equity securities, we determine whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time to allow for a -67-recovery of its fair value above its carrying amount. If any declines of equity securities are determined to be other-than-temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made.Certain FASB other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, guidance applies to fixed maturity securities and provides guidance on the recognition, presentation of, and disclosures for OTTIs. If a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and is presented within the Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income line item on our consolidated statements of income. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, the credit component of the OTTI is presented within the Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income line item on our consolidated statements of income and the non-credit component of the OTTI is recognized in other comprehensive income. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The credit component of an OTTI is determined primarily by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of acquisition. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other debt securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings, and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default.We have a committee of accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. The current economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets.We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. This could result in other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments being charged against future income. Given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional, material other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments may be recorded in future periods.In addition to available-for-sale investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $2,240.5, or 3.4% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2016. These long-term investments consisted primarily of certain other equity investments, cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and real estate. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term.Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage the market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits on investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future earnings and financial position. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $17,687.5 at December 31, 2016. The weighted-average credit rating of these securities was “A” as of December 31, 2016. Included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions and investments in mortgage-backed securities of $1,301.4 and $1.8, respectively, that are guaranteed by third parties. With the exception of eighteen securities with a fair value of $7.2, these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of “A” as of December 31, 2016. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of the fixed maturity securities without a guarantee, for which such information is available, was “A” as of December 31, 2016.-68-Fair values of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with FASB guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. We have controls in place to review the pricing services’ qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. In addition, we periodically review the pricing services’ pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable.We obtain only one quoted price for each security from the pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform monthly analysis on the prices received from the pricing services to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes a review of month-to-month price fluctuations. If unusual fluctuations are noted in this review, we may obtain additional information from other pricing services to validate the quoted price. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from the pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.In certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. Such securities are designated Level III in accordance with FASB guidance. Securities designated Level III at December 31, 2016 totaled $481.4 and represented approximately 2.3% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level III securities primarily consisted of certain corporate securities, equity securities and structured securities for which observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using internal estimates for inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields.For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” and Part II, Item 8, Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” Note 4, “Investments,” and Note 6, “Fair Value,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Retirement Benefits Pension BenefitsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for some of our employees. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FASB guidance for retirement benefits, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by the guidance, we calculate the value of plan assets as described below. Further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods. An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our December 31, 2016 measurement date, we selected a weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.95%. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and an average of historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase.This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. We apply a corridor approach to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. Under this approach, only accumulated net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the average remaining service or lifetime of the -69-workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date. At the December 31, 2016 measurement date, the selected weighted-average discount rate was 3.77%, compared to 3.92% at the December 31, 2015 measurement date. We developed this rate using a yield curve approach. Using yields available on high-quality fixed maturity securities with various maturity dates, the yield curve approach provides a “customized” rate, which is meant to match the expected cash flows of our specific benefit plans. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FASB guidance.In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities, equity securities and alternative investments across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow.Other Postretirement BenefitsWe provide most associates with certain medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits.At our December 31, 2016 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 3.82%, compared to a discount rate of 4.01% at the December 31, 2015 measurement date. We developed this rate using a yield curve approach as described above.The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of pre-Medicare (those who are not currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2016 measurement date was 8.00% for 2017 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2028. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of post-Medicare (those who are currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2016 measurement date was 6.00% for 2017 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2024. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016 by $42.2 and would increase service and interest costs by $1.8. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016 by $36.2 and would decrease service and interest costs by $1.5.For additional information regarding our retirement benefits, see Note 10, “Retirement Benefits,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.New Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended December 31, 2016 that had, or are expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures, see the “Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance” and “Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted” sections of Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesIntroductionOur cash receipts result primarily from premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases -70-of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity.We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy.A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations.The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. The securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility, although current market conditions are more stable. During recent years, the federal government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to restore liquidity in the financial markets and to help relieve the credit crisis and strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. In addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide liquidity and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions. We have a $2,500.0 commercial paper program. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we have the ability to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our $3,500.0 senior revolving credit facility to redeem any outstanding commercial paper upon maturity. Additionally, we believe the lenders participating in our credit facility would be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. In addition to the $3,500.0 senior revolving credit facility, we estimate that we will receive approximately $1,900.0 of dividends from our subsidiaries during 2017, which also provides further operating and financial flexibility. The table below outlines the cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: Years Ended December 31 2016 2015 2014Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities$3,204.5 $4,116.0 $3,369.3Investing activities(513.9) (1,151.5) (974.9)Financing activities(732.9) (2,997.4) (1,822.5)Effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents4.1 (5.3) (7.1)Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$1,961.8 $(38.2) $564.8Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 During the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $3,204.5, compared to $4,116.0 for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $911.5. The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in claims payments due to higher medical cost experience and growth in membership. The decrease was further due to the timing of claim reimbursements from our self-insured customers. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in premium receipts as a result of rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and growth in membership. The decrease was further offset by an increase in pharmacy rebates received.Net cash flow used in investing activities was $513.9 during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1,151.5 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in cash flow used in investing activities of $637.6 was primarily due to a -71-decrease in cash used for the purchase of subsidiaries, as net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 included the purchase of Simply Healthcare while there were no purchases of subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in net purchases of investments. Net cash flow used in financing activities was $732.9 during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $2,997.4 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in cash flow used in financing activities of $2,264.5 primarily resulted from a decrease in common stock repurchases, as we did not repurchase any common stock during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was further due to a decrease in net repayments of short- and long-term borrowings and changes in bank overdrafts. The decrease in cash flow used in financing activities was partially offset by changes in commercial paper borrowings, payments on debt-related derivatives in 2016, a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans and a decrease in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation.Liquidity— Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 During the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $4,116.0, compared to $3,369.3 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $746.7. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in premium receipts as a result of rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and the HIP Fee, and growth in membership. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was further attributable to the receipt of the reinsurance recoveries payment related to the 2014 Health Care Reform reinsurance premium stabilization program and payments made in 2014 that did not recur in 2015 for the adjudication of claims relating to the New York State contract conversion from our fully-insured Local Group business to a self-funded ASO contract. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in claims payments, primarily as a result of membership growth, an increase in income tax payments and an increase in the annual HIP Fee payment.Net cash flow used in investing activities was $1,151.5 during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $974.9 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cash flow used in investing activities of $176.6 primarily resulted from changes in cash flows relating to the purchase and sale of subsidiaries. Cash utilized for the purchase of subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to the purchase of Simply Healthcare. During the year ended December 31, 2014, cash was provided by the sale of our 1-800 CONTACTS business and glasses.com related assets. The increase in cash flow used in investing activities was partially offset by changes in securities lending collateral and a decrease in net purchases of investments.Net cash flow used in financing activities was $2,997.4 during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1,822.5 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cash flow used in financing activities of $1,174.9 primarily resulted from changes in long-term borrowings as a result of net repayments of long-term borrowings during 2015 compared to net proceeds from long-term borrowings during 2014. The increase in cash flow used in financing activities was further attributable to changes in securities lending payable, changes in bank overdrafts, an increase in cash dividends paid to shareholders and a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. The increase in cash flow used in financing activities was partially offset by a decrease in common stock repurchases, an increase in net proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, an increase in net proceeds from short-term borrowings and an increase in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation.Financial Condition We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, of $25,519.0 at December 31, 2016. Since December 31, 2015, total cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, increased by $2,394.3 primarily due to cash generated from operations, an increase in bank overdrafts changes, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans and excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. These increases were partially offset by cash dividends paid to shareholders, purchases of property and equipment, payments on debt-related derivatives and net repayments of short-term and commercial paper borrowings.Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Certain accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities, or statutory accounting practices, differ from GAAP. Changes that occur in statutory -72-accounting practices, if any, could impact our subsidiaries' future dividend capacity. In addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries.At December 31, 2016, we held $1,445.8 of cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company, which are available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, potential future common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders, repurchases of debt securities and debt and interest payments. DebtDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased $920.0 of the aggregate principal balance of our outstanding senior convertible debentures due 2042, or the Debentures. In addition, $66.6 aggregate principal balance was surrendered for conversion by certain holders in accordance with the terms and provisions of the indenture governing the Debentures. We elected to settle the excess of the principal amount of the repurchases and conversions with cash for total payments of $2,055.7. We recognized a gain on the extinguishment of debt related to the Debentures of $12.7, based on the fair values of the debt on the repurchase and conversion settlement dates. On September 10, 2015, we repaid, upon maturity, the $625.0 outstanding principal balance of our 1.25% senior unsecured notes due 2015. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased $13.0 of outstanding principal balance of certain other senior unsecured notes, plus applicable premium, accrued and unpaid interest, for cash totaling $16.2. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.4 on the repurchase of these notes.On May 12, 2015, we issued 25.0 Equity Units, pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated May 6, 2015, in an aggregate principal amount of $1,250.0. Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $50 (whole dollars) and consists of a purchase contract obligating the holder to purchase a certain number of shares of our common stock on May 1, 2018, subject to earlier termination or settlement, for a price in cash of $50 (whole dollars); and a 5% undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 (whole dollars) principal amount of our 1.900% remarketable subordinated notes, due 2028. We received $1,228.8 in cash proceeds from the issuance of the Equity Units, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us, and recorded $1,250.0 in long-term debt. On September 15, 2014, we redeemed the $500.0 outstanding principal balance of our 5.000% senior unsecured notes due 2014, plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, for cash totaling $512.3. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.3 on the redemption of these notes.On September 11, 2014, we redeemed the $1,097.9 outstanding principal balance of our 5.250% senior unsecured notes due 2016, plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, for cash totaling $1,178.2. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $67.6 on the redemption of these notes. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we repurchased $52.0 of outstanding principal amount of certain other senior unsecured notes, plus applicable premium for early redemption plus accrued and unpaid interest, for cash totaling $61.0. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.2 for the year ended December 31, 2014 on the repurchase of these notes.On August 12, 2014, we issued $850.0 of 2.250% notes due 2019, $800.0 of 3.500% notes due 2024, $800.0 of 4.650% notes due 2044, and $250.0 of 4.850% notes due 2054 under our shelf registration statement. We used the proceeds from this offering in part to fund the purchase price of the 5.000% and 5.250% senior unsecured notes discussed above, and the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year and commenced on February 15, 2015. The notes have a call feature that allows us to redeem the notes at any time at our option and a put feature that allows a note holder to redeem the notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the notes below an investment grade rating. For additional information related to our borrowing activities, see Note 12, “Debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We calculate our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, a non-GAAP measure, from the amounts presented on our audited consolidated balance sheets included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as the sum of short-term borrowings, plus current portion of long-term debt, plus long-term debt, less current -73-portion, divided by the sum of short-term borrowings, plus current portion of long-term debt, plus long-term debt, less current portion, plus total shareholders’ equity. We believe our debt-to-capital ratio assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. In addition, our bank covenants include a maximum debt-to-capital ratio that we cannot and did not exceed. Our debt-to-capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio was 38.5% and 40.8% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect that our pro forma debt-to-capital ratio will approximate 49% following the closing of the acquisition of Cigna, and we are committed to deleveraging to the low 40% range approximately twenty-four months following the closing.Our senior debt is rated “A” by Standard & Poor’s, “BBB” by Fitch, Inc., “Baa2” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. Following the announcement of the Merger Agreement, each of these rating agencies placed certain of our debt, financial strength and other credit ratings under review for a possible downgrade, however, we intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by limitations on future borrowings and a potential increase in our borrowing costs.Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity During the year ended December 31, 2015, we entered into a bridge facility commitment letter and a joinder agreement, and a term loan facility, to finance a portion of the pending acquisition of Cigna. In January 2017, we reduced the amount available under the bridge facility commitment letter from $22,500.0 to $19,500.0, and extended the termination date under the Merger Agreement, as well as the availability for commitments under the bridge facility and term loan facility, to April 30, 2017. The commitment of the lenders to provide the bridge facility and the term loan facility is subject to several conditions, including the completion of the acquisition of Cigna. For additional information, see the ""Overview"" section included in this ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations""; and Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestiture - Pending Acquisition of Cigna Corporation"" included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have a shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries and the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion.We have a senior revolving credit facility, or the Facility, with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. The Facility provides credit up to $3,500.0 and expires on August 25, 2020. The interest rate on the Facility is based on either the LIBOR rate or a base rate plus a predetermined rate based on our public debt rating at the date of utilization. Our ability to borrow under the Facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. There were no amounts outstanding under the senior revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2016 or 2015.We have an authorized commercial paper program of up to $2,500.0, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $629.0 and $682.2, respectively, of borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program. Commercial paper borrowings are classified as long-term debt as our general practice and intent is to replace short-term commercial paper outstanding at expiration with additional short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one year and we have the ability to redeem our commercial paper with borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility described above. We are a member, through certain subsidiaries, of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, collectively, the FHLBs, and as a member we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, $440.0 and $540.0, respectively, were outstanding under our short-term FHLBs borrowings.As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we are currently estimating approximately $1,900.0 of dividends to be paid to the parent company during 2017. During 2016, we received $2,688.8 of dividends from our subsidiaries.-74-We regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions, common stock and debt security repurchases and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.A summary of the cash dividend activity for the year ended December 31, 2016 is as follows:Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date CashDividendper Share TotalFebruary 18, 2016 March 10, 2016 March 25, 2016 $0.6500 $170.7April 26, 2016 June 10, 2016 June 24, 2016 0.6500 170.9July 26, 2016 September 9, 2016 September 26, 2016 0.6500 171.1November 1, 2016 December 5, 2016 December 21, 2016 0.6500 171.3On February 22, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.6500 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on March 24, 2017 to the shareholders of record as of March 10, 2017.Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. On October 2, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a $5,000.0 increase to the common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. The repurchases are effected from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase agreements, and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares under the program when we believe it is a prudent use of capital. The excess cost of the repurchased shares over par value is charged on a pro rata basis to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. There were no common stock repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2016. Total authorization remaining at December 31, 2016 was $4,175.9 and we expect to utilize the remaining authorized amount over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016 are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 YearsOn-Balance Sheet: Debt1 $24,551.2 $2,571.1 $3,615.7 $2,320.1 $16,044.3Other long-term liabilities2 1,260.8 419.6 453.5 302.1 85.6Off-Balance Sheet: Purchase obligations32,059.0 975.6 984.0 99.4 —Operating lease commitments770.5 149.7 258.5 161.2 201.1Investment commitments4798.0 324.8 316.8 137.3 19.1Total contractual obligations and commitments$29,439.5 $4,440.8 $5,628.5 $3,020.1 $16,350.1 1Includes estimated interest expense. 2Primarily consists of reserves for future policy benefits, projected other postretirement benefits, deferred compensation, supplemental executive retirement plan liabilities and certain other miscellaneous long-term obligations. Estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from this table as we had no funding requirements under ERISA at December 31, 2016 as a result of the value of the assets in the plans. 3Includes estimated payments for future services under contractual arrangements from third-party service contracts.4Includes unfunded capital commitments for alternative investments.-75-The above table does not contain $150.0 of gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions and interest for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities. For further information, see Note 7, “Income Taxes,” to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our senior revolving credit facility, bridge facility, term loan facility and/or from public or private financing sources, will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet derivative instruments, guarantee transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements or any indemnification agreements that will require funding in future periods. We have not transferred assets to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not hold any variable interest in an unconsolidated entity where such entity provides us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support.Risk-Based CapitalOur regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies and health maintenance organizations largely based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under the RBC Model Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our regulated subsidiaries' respective RBC levels as of December 31, 2016, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, were in excess of all mandatory RBC requirements. In addition to exceeding the RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries.For additional information, see Note 21, “Statutory Information,"" to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable securities laws. Investors are also advised to carefully review and consider the various risks and other disclosures discussed in our SEC reports.-77-ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. (In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein)As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2016. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return.InvestmentsOur investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk.The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit event, such as a ratings downgrade or default, to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that event. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately “A.” Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which have exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value.Our available-for-sale investment portfolio includes corporate securities which account for 42.2% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2016 and are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. We manage this risk through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of our corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately “BBB.”Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systemic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio.As of December 31, 2016, 92.2% of our available-for-sale investments were fixed maturity securities. Market risk is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $782.4 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $765.7 increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly.As of December 31, 2016, 7.8% of our available-for-sale investments were equity securities. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $150.0. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $150.0.-78-For additional information regarding our investments, see Part II, Item 8, Note 4, “Investments,” to our audited consolidated financial statements and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Investments” within Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Long-Term DebtOur total long-term debt at December 31, 2016 consists of senior unsecured notes, remarketable subordinated notes, convertible debentures, commercial paper and subordinated surplus notes by one of our insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2016, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $15,286.9 and $16,507.6, respectively. This debt is subject to interest rate risk as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. For additional information regarding our long-term debt, see Note 6, ""Fair Value"" and Note 12, “Debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Derivatives We have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts, which are used to lock-in interest rates or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. We have used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities.Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these derivatives. As of December 31, 2016, we recorded a net asset of $526.1, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swaps' fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $696.3 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $696.3 increase in fair value.We also utilize put and call options on the S&P 500 index to hedge, on an economic basis, the exposure of our equity security portfolio to fluctuations in the equity markets. While the impact of fluctuations in the equity markets on these derivatives are largely offset by changes in the fair values of our equity security portfolio, the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized immediately in our income statement, whereas the change in fair value of our equity securities is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Accordingly, a decrease in the S&P 500 index of 10% would result in an approximate increase of $42.6 in the fair value of these derivatives. An increase in the S&P 500 index of 10% would result in an approximate decrease of $24.3 in the fair value of these derivatives.For additional information regarding our derivatives, see Note 5, “Derivative Financial Instruments” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein) References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Anthem” or the “Company” refer to Anthem, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and, unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries. References to the term ""states"" include the District of Columbia, unless the context otherwise requires. This Management's Discussion and Analysis, or MD&A, should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.OverviewWe manage our operations through three reportable segments: Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business and Other. We regularly evaluate the appropriateness of our reportable segments, particularly in light of organizational changes, merger and acquisition activity and changing laws and regulations. As a result, these reportable segments may change in the future. Our Commercial & Specialty Business segment includes our Local Group, National Accounts, Individual and Specialty businesses. Business units in the Commercial & Specialty Business segment offer fully-insured health products; provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management, disease management, wellness programs and other administrative services; and provide an array of specialty and other insurance products and services such as dental, vision, life and disability insurance benefits, radiology benefit management and analytics-driven personal healthcare guidance.Our Government Business segment includes our Medicare and Medicaid businesses, National Government Services, or NGS, and services provided to the federal government in connection with FEP®. Medicaid makes federal matching funds available to all states for the delivery of healthcare benefits to eligible individuals, principally those with incomes below specified levels who meet other state-specified requirements. Medicaid is structured to allow each state to establish its own eligibility standards, benefits package, payment rates and program administration under broad federal guidelines. Our Medicare customers are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a managed care alternative for the Medicare program, who have purchased Medicare Supplement benefit coverage, some disabled members under age 65, or members of all ages with end stage renal disease. Medicare Supplement policies are sold to Medicare recipients as supplements to the benefits they receive from the Medicare program. Rates are filed with, and in some cases approved by, state insurance departments. Most of the premium for Medicare Advantage is paid directly by the federal government on behalf of the participant who may also be charged a small premium. Additionally, through our alliance partnership engagements with larger provider groups and BCBS plans, we offer a variety of Medicaid services that include joint ventures, administrative service offerings, and full-risk arrangements. NGS acts as a Medicare contractor for the federal government in several regions across the nation. Our Other segment includes other businesses that do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, guidance, as well as corporate expenses not allocated to either of our other reportable segments.Our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue comes from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. Administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, or where the fee is based on either processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized. Additionally, we earn administrative fee revenues from our Medicare processing business and from other health-related businesses including disease management programs. Other revenue includes miscellaneous income other than premium revenue and administrative fees.Our benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our fully-insured members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures -43-per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. While we offer a diversified mix of managed care products and services through our managed care plans, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products and services. Our managed care plans include: Preferred Provider Organizations, or PPOs; Health Maintenance Organizations, or HMOs; Point-of-Service plans, or POS plans; traditional indemnity plans and other hybrid plans, including Consumer-Driven Health Plans, or CDHPs; and hospital only and limited benefit products. We classify certain claims-related costs as benefit expense to reflect costs incurred for our members’ traditional medical care, as well as those expenses which improve our members’ health and medical outcomes. These claims-related costs may be comprised of expenses incurred for: (i) medical management, including case and utilization management; (ii) health and wellness, including disease management services for such conditions as diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, congestive heart failure and asthma management and wellness initiatives like weight-loss programs and smoking cessation treatments; and (iii) clinical health policy. These types of claims-related costs are designed to ultimately lower our members’ cost of care. Our selling expense consists of external broker commission expenses, and generally varies with premium or membership volume. Our general and administrative expense consists of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels and thus, associated compensation expense. Other variable costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity.Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage healthcare costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management and health and wellness programs. Several economic factors related to healthcare costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating healthcare costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers and any regulatory or market driven restrictions on our ability to obtain adequate premium rates to offset overall inflation in healthcare costs, including increases in unit costs and utilization resulting from the aging of the population and other demographics, as well as advances in medical technology, may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. On December 22, 2017, the federal government enacted a tax bill, H.R.1, An act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, or the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including, but not limited to, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and modifying or limiting many business deductions. At December 31, 2017, we had not completed our accounting for the tax effects resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; however, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances. We remeasured deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to be utilized in the future, which is generally 21%. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of those balances or give rise to new deferred tax amounts. The provisional amount recorded related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was a non-recurring benefit of $1,108.3 and is included as a component of income tax expense.On February 15, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Freedom Health, Inc., Optimum HealthCare, Inc., America’s 1st Choice of South Carolina, Inc. and related entities, or collectively, America’s 1st Choice, a Medicare Advantage organization that offers HMO products, including Chronic Special Needs Plans and Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plans under its Freedom Health and Optimum HealthCare brands in Florida and its America’s 1st Choice of South Carolina brand in South Carolina. Through its Medicare Advantage Plans, America’s 1st Choice currently serves approximately one hundred and thirty -44-thousand members in twenty-five Florida and three South Carolina counties. The acquisition of America's 1st Choice aligns with our plans for continued growth in the Medicare Advantage and Special Needs populations.On December 21, 2017, we completed our acquisition of HealthSun Health Plans, Inc., or HealthSun, which serves approximately forty thousand members in the state of Florida through its Medicare Advantage Plans, which received a five-star rating from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS. The HealthSun acquisition aligns with our plans for continued growth in the Medicare Advantage and dual-eligible populations. In March 2016, we filed a lawsuit against our vendor for pharmacy benefit management services, Express Scripts, Inc., or Express Scripts, seeking to recover damages for pharmacy pricing that is higher than competitive benchmark pricing and damages related to operational breaches, as well as various declarations under the agreement between the parties. In April 2016, Express Scripts filed an answer to the lawsuit disputing our contractual claims and alleging various defenses and counterclaims. For additional information regarding this lawsuit, see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In October 2017, we announced that we are establishing a new pharmacy benefits manager, or PBM, called IngenioRx, and have entered into a five-year agreement with CaremarkPCS Health, L.L.C., or CVS Health, to begin offering a full suite of PBM solutions starting on January 1, 2020, which coincides with the conclusion of our current agreement with Express Scripts.On July 24, 2015, we and Cigna Corporation, or Cigna, announced that we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or Cigna Merger Agreement, dated as of July 23, 2015, to acquire all outstanding shares of Cigna. In July 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice, along with certain state attorneys general, filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, or District Court, seeking to block the merger. On February 14, 2017, Cigna purported to terminate the Cigna Merger Agreement and commenced litigation against us in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or Delaware Court, seeking damages, including the $1,850.0 termination fee pursuant to the terms of the Cigna Merger Agreement, and a declaratory judgment that its purported termination of the Cigna Merger Agreement was lawful, among other claims, which is captioned Cigna Corp. v. Anthem Inc. We believe Cigna’s allegations are without merit. Also on February 14, 2017, we initiated our own litigation against Cigna in the Delaware Court seeking a temporary restraining order to enjoin Cigna from terminating the Cigna Merger Agreement, specific performance compelling Cigna to comply with the Cigna Merger Agreement and damages, which is captioned Anthem Inc. v. Cigna Corp. On April 28, 2017, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the ruling of the District Court, which blocked the merger. On May 11, 2017, the Delaware Court denied our motion to enjoin Cigna from terminating the Cigna Merger Agreement. On May 12, 2017, we delivered to Cigna a notice terminating the Cigna Merger Agreement. For additional information about these lawsuits, see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On February 17, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Simply Healthcare Holdings, Inc., or Simply Healthcare, a leading managed care company for people enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare programs in the state of Florida. This acquisition aligns with our strategy for continued growth in our Government Business segment. For additional information related to the acquisitions of America's 1st Choice, HealthSun and Simply Healthcare, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions"" included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The future results of our operations will also be impacted by certain external forces and resulting changes in our business model and strategy. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, as amended, or collectively, the ACA, has changed and may continue to make broad-based changes to the U.S. healthcare system. The ACA presented us with new growth opportunities, but also introduced new risks, regulatory challenges and uncertainties, and required changes in the way products are designed, underwritten, priced, distributed and administered. Changes to our business are likely to continue for the next several years as elected officials at the national and state levels have proposed significant modifications to existing laws and regulations, including the potential repeal or replacement of the ACA and the reduction or elimination of federal subsidies made available through the ACA for certain public exchange Individual products, including the discontinuance of the cost-sharing reduction subsidy effective October 2017. As a result of the complexity of the ACA, its impact on healthcare in the United States and the continuing modification and interpretation of the ACA rules, we will continue to evaluate the impact of the ACA as additional guidance is made -45-available. For additional discussion, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Regulation,” and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Product pricing remains competitive and we strive to price our healthcare benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends. We believe our pricing strategy, based on predictive modeling, proprietary research and data-driven processes has positioned us to benefit from the potential growth opportunities available through entry into new markets, expansions in existing markets and as a result of any subsequent changes to the current regulatory scheme. We believe that our pricing strategy, brand name and network quality will provide a strong foundation for membership growth opportunities in the future. In the Individual and Small Group markets, we offer on-exchange products through state or federally facilitated marketplaces, referred to as public exchanges, and off-exchange products. Federal subsidies are available for certain members, subject to income and family size, who purchase public exchange products. During 2017, we notified various state regulators of our decision to dramatically reduce our participation in the Individual ACA-compliant marketplaces within their respective states. The uncertainty around, and subsequent termination of, the federal funding of the cost-sharing reduction subsidy available through the ACA was an important factor as we evaluated the appropriate level of our marketplace participation. Our strategy has been, and will continue to be, to only participate in rating regions where we have an appropriate level of confidence that these markets are on a path toward sustainability, including, but not limited to, factors such as expected financial performance, regulatory environment, and underlying market characteristics. In 2018, we will continue to offer Individual ACA-compliant products in 56 of the 143 rating regions in which we operate. Private exchanges have gained visibility in the marketplace based on the promise of helping employers reduce costs, increase consumer engagement and manage the complexities created by the ACA and other market forces. While private exchanges have been a distribution channel in the Medicare and Individual markets for some time, in more recent years the Commercial market has received an increased level of attention from the consulting and broker communities as well as health insurance carriers. In response, we have continued our broad-based strategy of offering our own private exchange, Anthem Health Marketplace, consumer experience platform to groups, while also participating in four large national consultant-led exchanges, several regional broker-led exchanges and various Individual, Commercial and Medicare exchanges. To date, adoption levels in the Commercial market overall have been lower than analyst predictions. While the ultimate volume, pace of growth and winning business models remain highly uncertain in this space, we continue to believe we are well positioned to adapt with the market as it evolves. Current federal law stemming from the ACA imposes regulations on the health insurance sector, including, but not limited to, guaranteed coverage and expanded benefit requirements; prohibitions on some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to our members; minimum medical loss ratio, or MLR, and customer rebate requirements; establishment of a mandatory annual Health Insurance Provider Fee, or HIP Fee; a federal rate review process; a requirement to cover preventive services on a first dollar basis; the utilization of public exchanges to offer Individual and Small Group products; and greater limitations on how we price certain of our products. In addition, the legislation reduces the reimbursement levels for our health plans participating in the Medicare Advantage program over time and limits the amount of executive compensation that is deductible for income tax purposes.As a result of the ACA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, issued MLR regulations that require us to meet minimum MLR thresholds for Large Group, Small Group and Individual lines of business. Plans that do not meet the minimum thresholds will have to pay a MLR rebate. For purposes of determining MLR rebates, HHS has defined the types of costs that should be included in the MLR rebate calculation. However, certain components of the MLR calculation as defined by HHS cannot be classified consistently under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. While considered benefit expense or a reduction of premium revenue by HHS, certain of these costs are classified as other types of expense, such as income tax expense or general and administrative expense, in our GAAP basis financial statements. Accordingly, the benefit expense ratio determined using our consolidated GAAP operating results is not comparable to the MLR calculated under HHS regulations. The ACA also imposed a separate minimum MLR threshold of 85% for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, or Medicare Part D. Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D plans that do not meet this threshold will have to pay a minimum MLR rebate. If a plan’s MLR is below 85% for three consecutive years beginning with 2014, -46-enrollment will be restricted. A Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D plan contract will be terminated if the plan's MLR is below 85% for five consecutive years. The ACA imposed an annual HIP Fee on health insurers that write certain types of health insurance on U.S. risks. The annual HIP Fee is allocated to health insurers based on the ratio of the amount of an insurer's net premium revenues written during the preceding calendar year to an adjusted amount of health insurance for all U.S. health risk for those certain lines of business written during the preceding calendar year. We record our estimated liability for the HIP Fee in full at the beginning of the year with a corresponding deferred asset that is amortized on a straight-line basis to general and administrative expense. The final calculation and payment of the annual HIP Fee occurs in the third quarter each year. The HIP Fee is non-deductible for federal income tax purposes. We price our affected products to cover the increased general and administrative and tax expenses associated with the HIP Fee. The total amount due from allocations to health insurers was $11,300.0 for each of 2015 and 2016, was suspended for 2017, has resumed and increased to $14,300.0 for 2018 and is suspended for 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $1,176.3 and $1,207.5, respectively, as general and administrative expense related to the HIP Fee. There was no corresponding expense for 2017 due to the suspension of the HIP Fee for 2017. These and other provisions of the ACA are likely to have significant effects on our future operations, which, in turn, could impact the value of our business model and results of operations, including potential impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the ACA including any substantial changes to existing laws or regulations that may impact our business. For additional discussion regarding the ACA, see Part I, Item 1 “Business—Regulation” and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Finally, federal and state regulatory agencies may further restrict our ability to obtain new product approvals, implement changes in premium rates, impose new taxes or impose additional restrictions, under new or existing laws that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.The National Organization of Life & Health Insurance Guaranty Associations, or NOLHGA, is a voluntary organization consisting of the state life and health insurance guaranty associations located throughout the U.S. Such associations, working together with NOLHGA, provide a safety net for their state’s policyholders, ensuring that they continue to receive coverage, subject to state maximum limits, even if their insurer is declared insolvent. In March 2017, long term care insurance writers Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary, American Network Insurance Company (collectively, Penn Treaty), were ordered to be liquidated by the Pennsylvania state court, which had jurisdiction over the Penn Treaty rehabilitation proceeding. We and other insurers will be obligated to pay a portion of their policyholder claims through state guaranty association assessments in future periods. We estimated our portion of these net assessments for the insolvency of Penn Treaty to be approximately $253.8 and recorded the estimate as a general and administrative expense. Payment of the assessments will be largely recovered through premium billing surcharges and premium tax credits over future years. In addition to the external forces discussed in the preceding paragraphs, our results of operations are impacted by levels and mix of membership. In recent years, we have experienced membership growth due to the quality and pricing of our health benefits products and services, improved economic conditions, decreases in unemployment, acquisitions, entry into new markets and expansions in existing markets. In addition, we believe the self-insured portion of our group membership base will continue to increase as a percentage of total group membership. However, these membership trends could be negatively impacted by various factors that could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations such as general economic downturns that result in business failures, failure to obtain new customers or retain existing customers, premium increases, benefit changes or our exit from a specific market. Further, our mix of membership may include more individuals with a higher acuity level obtaining coverage through our products available on the public exchanges, which may not be appropriately adjusted for in our premium rates. In February 2015, we reported that we were the target of a sophisticated external cyber attack. The attackers gained unauthorized access to certain of our information technology systems and obtained personal information related to many individuals and employees. We have continued to implement security enhancements since this incident. For additional information about the cyber attack, see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies - Cyber Attack Incident,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. -47-Also see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of the factors identified above and other risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time.Executive SummaryWe are one of the largest health benefits companies in the United States in terms of medical membership, serving 40.2 medical members through our affiliated health plans as of December 31, 2017. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or BCBS, licensee for Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (in varying counties as BCBS, Blue Cross or Empire BlueCross BlueShield HealthPlus), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield or Empire Blue Cross (in our New York service areas). We also conduct business through arrangements with other BCBS licensees in Louisiana, South Carolina and western New York. Through our AMERIGROUP Corporation, or Amerigroup, subsidiary and other subsidiaries, we conduct business in Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Washington, D.C. In addition, we conduct business through our Simply Healthcare and HealthSun subsidiaries in Florida. We also serve customers throughout the country as HealthLink, UniCare, and in certain Arizona, California, Connecticut, Iowa, Nevada, Tennessee and Virginia markets through our CareMore Health Group, Inc., or CareMore, subsidiary. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia through our subsidiaries. Operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $89,061.2, an increase of $4,867.2, or 5.8%, from the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating revenue was primarily a result of higher premium revenue in both our Government Business and Commercial & Specialty Business segments, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fee revenue in our Commercial & Specialty Business segment. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $3,842.8, an increase of $1,373.0, or 55.6%, from the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income was primarily a result of lower income tax expense and an increase in net earnings from investment activities. The increase in net income was partially offset by lower operating results in both our Government Business and Commercial & Specialty Business segments and losses realized on extinguishment of debt.Our diluted earnings per share, or EPS, for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $14.35, an increase of $5.14, or 55.8%, from the year ended December 31, 2016. Our diluted shares for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 267.8, a decrease of 0.3, or 0.1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in EPS resulted from the increase in net income, and to a lesser extent, the lower number of shares outstanding in 2017.Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $4,184.8, or 1.1 times net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3,270.2, or 1.3 times net income. The increase in operating cash flow from 2016 of $914.6 was primarily attributable to an increase in premium receipts as a result of both rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends, and growth in membership. The increase in cash flow was partially offset by an increase in claims payments due to higher medical cost experience and growth in membership. The increase was further offset by an increase in spend to support our growth initiatives, the timing of provider capitation payments for pass-through funding under the California Medicaid contract and the timing of certain state Medicaid payments.Our results of operations discussed throughout this MD&A are determined in accordance with GAAP. We also calculate operating gain, a non-GAAP measure, to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results and comparing them among periods. We define operating revenue as premium income, administrative fees and other revenues. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, and selling, general and administrative expense. We use these measures as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, forecasting future operating periods and setting incentive compensation targets. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income before income tax expense, net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional details on operating gain, see our “Reportable Segments Results of Operations” discussion included in this MD&A. For a reconciliation of reportable segment -48-operating revenue to the amounts of total revenue included in the consolidated statements of income and a reconciliation of reportable segment operating gain to income before income tax expense, see Note 19, ""Segment Information,"" to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We intend to expand through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and efficient use of capital in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale, as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. While we have achieved strong growth as a result of strategic mergers and acquisitions, we have also achieved organic growth in our existing markets over time by delivering excellent service, offering competitively priced products, providing access to high quality provider networks and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks.Significant TransactionsThe significant transactions that have occurred over the last three years that have impacted or will impact our capital structure or that have or will influence how we conduct our business operations include:•Acquisition of America's 1st Choice (2018);•Acquisition of HealthSun (2017);•Acquisition of Simply Healthcare (2015); and•Board of Directors declaration of dividends on common stock (2013 through January 2018); authorization for repurchases of our common stock (2017 and prior); and debt repurchases and new debt issuance (2017 and prior).For additional information regarding these transactions, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions,” Note 12, ""Debt"" and Note 14, “Capital Stock,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.MembershipOur medical membership includes seven different customer types: Local Group, Individual, National Accounts, BlueCard®, Medicare, Medicaid and FEP®. BCBS-branded business generally refers to members in our service areas licensed by the BCBSA. Non-BCBS-branded business refers to Amerigroup, CareMore, HealthSun and Simply Healthcare members as well as HealthLink and UniCare members predominantly outside of our BCBSA service areas, and effective February 12, 2018, our America's 1st Choice members.•Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. In addition, Local Group includes UniCare members and Employer Group Medicare Advantage members, or retired members of Local Group accounts who have selected a Medicare Advantage product. Local Group accounts are generally sold through brokers or consultants working with industry specialists from our in-house sales force and are offered both on and off the public exchanges. Local Group insurance premiums may be based on claims incurred by the group or sold on a self-insured basis. The customer’s buying decision is typically based upon the size and breadth of our networks, customer service, the quality of our medical management services, the administrative cost included in our quoted price, our financial stability, our reputation and our ability to effectively service large complex accounts. Local Group accounted for 39.4%, 38.7% and 39.5% of our medical members at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.•Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. Individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, retail partnerships, our in-house sales force or via the exchanges. Individual business is sold on a fully-insured basis. We offer on-exchange products through public exchanges and off-exchange products. Federal premium subsidies are available only for certain public exchange Individual products. Unsubsidized Individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network, and the efficiency of administration. Customer turnover is generally -49-higher with Individual as compared to Local Group. Individual business accounted for 3.9%, 4.2% and 4.3% of our medical members at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.•National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in an Anthem service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker and consultant relationships. Service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. National Accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. We believe we have an advantage when competing for very large National Accounts due to the size and breadth of our networks and our ability to access the national provider networks of BCBS companies at their competitive local market rates. In addition, Employer Group Medicare Advantage members related to National Accounts groups are reported as part of National Accounts membership. National Accounts represented 19.1%, 19.4% and 19.1% of our medical members at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.•BlueCard® host customers represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by Anthem who receive healthcare services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard® membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard® program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which an Anthem subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-Anthem controlled BCBSA licensee (i.e., the “home plan”). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard® members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard® members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard® claims received per month. BlueCard® host membership accounted for 13.7%, 13.9% and 14.0% of our medical members at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.•Medicare customers are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Supplement plans; Medicare Advantage, including Special Needs Plans; Medicare Part D; and dual-eligible programs through Medicare-Medicaid Plans, or MMPs. Medicare Supplement plans typically pay the difference between healthcare costs incurred by a beneficiary and amounts paid by Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans provide Medicare beneficiaries with a managed care alternative to traditional Medicare and often include a Medicare Part D benefit. In addition, our Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plans provide tailored benefits to Medicare beneficiaries who have chronic diseases and also cover certain dual-eligible customers, who are low-income seniors and persons under age 65 with disabilities. Medicare Part D offers a prescription drug plan to Medicare and MMP beneficiaries. MMP is a demonstration program focused on serving members who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare, which was established as a result of the passage of the ACA. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. Medicare business accounted for 3.8%, 3.6% and 3.7% of our medical members at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.•Medicaid membership represents eligible members who receive healthcare benefits through publicly funded healthcare programs, including Medicaid, ACA-related Medicaid expansion programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, programs for seniors and people with disabilities, Children’s Health Insurance Programs, and specialty programs such as those focused on long-term services and support, HIV/AIDS, foster care, behavioral health and/or substance abuse disorders, and intellectual disabilities or developmental disabilities, among others. Total Medicaid program business accounted for 16.1%, 16.4% and 15.3% of our medical members at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.•FEP® members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. FEP® business accounted for 3.9%, 3.9% and 4.1% of our medical members at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two principal funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain most or all of the financial risk -50-associated with their employees’ healthcare costs. Some self-funded customers choose to purchase stop loss coverage to limit their retained risk.The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

These increases were partially offset by attrition in both our non-ACA-compliant and ACA-compliant off-exchange Individual product offerings.Local Group membership increased 441, or 2.9%, primarily due to new sales and growth in our existing Large Group accounts. Individual membership decreased 76, or 4.6%, primarily due to attrition in both our non-ACA-compliant and ACA-compliant off-exchange product offerings, partially offset by growth in our ACA-compliant on-exchange product offerings.National Accounts membership decreased 58, or 0.7%, primarily due to the loss of a large multi-state employer group contract, partially offset by new sales. BlueCard® membership decreased 29, or 0.5%, primarily due to lower membership activity at other BCBSA plans whose members reside in or travel to our licensed areas.Medicare membership increased 107, or 7.4%, primarily due to higher sales during open enrollment, membership acquired through the acquisition of HealthSun and growth in certain existing Medicare Advantage markets.Medicaid membership decreased 52, or 0.8%, primarily due to membership reverification processes and the impact of a new entrant in one of our existing markets, partially offset by new business expansions.FEP® membership decreased 8, or 0.5%, primarily due to reduced federal hiring to replace retirees.Other Membership (in thousands)Our Other products are often ancillary to our health business and can therefore be impacted by corresponding changes in our medical membership.Life and disability membership decreased 32, or 0.7%, primarily due to higher lapses in our fully-insured Local Group business.Dental membership increased 378, or 6.9%, primarily due to new sales and increased penetration in our Local Group and National Account businesses.Dental administration membership increased 48, or 0.9%, primarily due to membership expansion under current contracts.Vision membership increased 479, or 7.5%, primarily due to new sales and increased penetration in our National Accounts, Local Group and Medicare product offerings.Medicare Advantage Part D membership increased 73, or 11.6%, primarily due to membership acquired through the acquisition of HealthSun and higher sales during open enrollment.Medicare Part D standalone membership decreased 32, or 9.1%, primarily due to our product repositioning strategies in certain markets.December 31, 2016 Compared to December 31, 2015 Medical Membership (in thousands)During the year ended December 31, 2016, total medical membership increased 1,320, or 3.4%, primarily due to increases in our Medicaid, National Accounts, Local Group and BlueCard® membership.-52-Self-funded medical membership increased 1,022, or 4.3%, primarily due to increases in our National Accounts, Large Group accounts and BlueCard® membership.Fully-insured membership increased 298, or 2.0%, primarily due to growth in our Medicaid business, partially offset by declines in Local Group fully-insured membership.Local Group membership increased 188, or 1.2%, primarily due to growth in our Large Group self-funded accounts as a result of new sales and conversions of fully-insured contracts to self-funded administrative service only, or ASO contracts. The increase was partially offset by attrition in our fully-insured product offerings resulting from competitive pressures and conversions to self-funded ASO contracts.Individual membership decreased 11, or 0.7%, primarily due to attrition in non-ACA-compliant product offerings, partially offset by growth in ACA-compliant off- and on-exchange product offerings.National Accounts membership increased 386, or 5.2%, primarily due to the implementation of new large multi-state employer group contracts and expansion in existing employer group accounts.BlueCard® membership increased 143, or 2.6%, primarily due to higher membership activity at other BCBSA plans whose members reside in or travel to our licensed areas.Medicare membership decreased 1, or 0.1%, primarily due to membership losses from strategic market exits, partially offset by growth in certain existing markets.Medicaid membership increased 613, or 10.4%, primarily due to new business expansions and organic growth in existing markets.FEP® membership increased 2, or 0.1%, primarily due to higher sales during the open enrollment. Other Membership (in thousands)Our Other products are often ancillary to our health business and can therefore be impacted by corresponding changes in our medical membership.Life and disability membership decreased 117, or 2.4%, primarily due to higher lapses in our fully-insured Local Group business.Dental membership increased 280, or 5.4%, primarily due to new sales and growth in our Local Group and ACA-compliant Individual product offerings.Dental administration membership increased 12, or 0.2%, primarily due to membership expansion under current contracts.Vision membership increased 747, or 13.2%, primarily due to growth in our Local Group, National accounts and ACA-compliant Individual product offerings.Medicare Advantage Part D membership increased 7, or 1.1%, primarily due to higher sales during the open enrollment period.Medicare Part D standalone membership decreased 21, or 5.7%, primarily due to our product repositioning strategies and select strategic actions in certain markets.Cost of Care The following discussion summarizes our aggregate underlying cost of care trends for the year ended December 31, 2017 for our Local Group fully-insured business only.For the full year 2017, underlying Local Group medical cost trend was approximately 6.5%. We are updating the reporting of our underlying Local Group medical cost trend in 2018 to reflect the ""allowed amount"", or contractual rate, paid -53-to providers. The previous methodology was based on the ""paid amount,"" which is the ""allowed amount"" less copays and deductibles. We believe using the allowed amount is a better indicator of overall healthcare trend and therefore a more informative metric. Under the ""allowed amount,"" we anticipate the Local Group medical cost trend will be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% in 2018. If 2017 was calculated on a consistent basis with the updated methodology in 2018, Local Group medical cost trends would have been approximately 5.5%.Our medical cost trends are primarily driven by increases in the utilization of services across all provider types and the unit cost increases of these services. We work to mitigate these trends through various medical management programs such as utilization management, condition management, program integrity and specialty pharmacy management, as well as benefit design changes. There are many drivers of medical cost trend which can cause variance from our estimates, such as changes in the level and mix of services utilized, regulatory changes, aging of the population, health status and other demographic characteristics of our members, epidemics, advances in medical technology, new high cost prescription drugs, and healthcare provider or member fraud.-54-Consolidated Results of OperationsOur consolidated summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are discussed in the following section.

Premiums for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $83,647.7, $78,860.1 and $73,385.1, respectively. Premiums are included in total operating revenue presented above.3bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%.4Selling, general and administrative expense ratio represents selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total operating revenue.Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Total operating revenue increased $4,867.2, or 5.8%, to $89,061.2 in 2017, resulting primarily from higher premiums, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees. Higher premiums were due, in part, to rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends. The increase was further attributable to membership growth in our Medicare Advantage and Large Group product offerings. The increase in premiums was partially offset by the impact of the HIP Fee suspension for 2017, as we did not price affected products to cover any HIP Fee related expense in the current year. Additionally, declines in membership in both our non-ACA-compliant and ACA-compliant off-exchange Individual businesses, lower favorable adjustments to prior year estimates for the ACA risk adjustment premium stabilization program and declines in membership in our National Accounts business partially offset the overall increase in premiums. The increase in administrative fees primarily resulted from membership growth in our self-funded Large Group business.-55-Net investment income increased $87.0, or 11.2%, to $866.5 in 2017, primarily due to higher income from alternative investments and higher investment yields on fixed maturity securities, partially offset by lower dividend yields on equity securities.Net realized gains on financial instruments increased $139.9, or 2,855.1%, to $144.8 in 2017, primarily due to a decrease in net realized losses on derivative financial instruments and an increase in net realized gains on sales of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by a decrease in net realized gains on sales of equity securities.Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments decreased $82.3, or 71.3%, to $33.1 in 2017, primarily due to a decrease in impairment losses on fixed maturity securities.Benefit expense increased $5,401.8, or 8.1%, to $72,236.2 in 2017, primarily due to increased costs as a result of overall cost trends across our businesses. The increase was further attributable to membership growth in our Medicare Advantage and Large Group business product offerings. These increases were partially offset by the impact of membership declines in both our non-ACA-compliant and ACA-compliant off-exchange Individual product offerings.Our benefit expense ratio increased 160 basis points to 86.4% in 2017. The increase in the ratio was largely driven by the loss of revenue associated with the HIP Fee suspension for 2017, higher medical cost experience in our Medicare business and adjustments to prior year estimates for the ACA risk adjustment premium stabilization program. The increase in the ratio was partially offset by improved medical cost experience in our Individual business.Selling, general and administrative expense increased $91.7, or 0.7%, to $12,649.6 in 2017. The increase in expense was due, in part, to an increase in spend to support our growth initiatives, the recognition of a guaranty fund assessment related to the liquidation order of Penn Treaty, an increase in performance-based incentive compensation and a legal settlement accrual related to settlement of the 2015 cyber attack class action litigation. For additional information regarding the Penn Treaty liquidation and the cyber attack and related settlement, see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies - Other Contingencies,” and “Commitments and Contingencies - Cyber Attack Incident,” respectively, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These increases were partially offset by lower ACA fees, primarily as a result of the suspension of the HIP Fee for 2017 and, to a lesser extent, the expiration of the fees for the ACA temporary reinsurance premium stabilization program that ended on December 31, 2016. The increases were further offset by lower selling, general and administrative costs related to expense efficiency initiatives and lower transaction costs related to the terminated Cigna Merger Agreement.Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 70 basis points to 14.2% in 2017. The decrease in the ratio was due, in part, to the lower ACA fees discussed above, lower selling, general and administrative costs related to expense efficiency initiatives and growth in operating revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in spend to support our growth initiatives, the impact of the Penn Treaty guaranty fund assessment, an increase in performance-based incentive compensation and the accrual related to the settlement of the 2015 cyber attack class action litigation.Other expense increased $274.5, or 30.0%, to $1,189.8 in 2017, primarily due to losses on debt extinguishment. For additional information related to our borrowings, refer to the subsequent section herein titled ""Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt.""Income tax expense decreased $1,964.6, or 94.2%, to $121.0 in 2017, primarily due to the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the suspension of the non-tax deductible HIP Fee for 2017 and the favorable impact of our recognition of tax benefits for prior acquisition costs incurred related to the terminated Cigna Merger Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a non-recurring income tax benefit of $1,108.3 related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized additional income tax expense of $411.7 related to the HIP Fee. The decrease in income tax expense was further due to the recognition of excess tax benefits during the year ended December 31, 2017 from the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, or ASU 2016-09. For additional information related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, see Note 2, “Basis of Presentation of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized additional California deferred state tax expense resulting from specific California legislation related to Managed Care Organizations that did not recur in 2017.-56-The effective tax rates in 2017 and 2016 were 3.1% and 45.8%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, suspension of the HIP Fee, the deduction of the prior acquisition costs incurred related to the terminated Cigna Merger Agreement, the excess tax benefits from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the additional 2016 California deferred state tax expense, discussed above.Our net income as a percentage of total revenue increased 140 basis points to 4.3% in 2017 as compared to 2016 as a result of all factors discussed above.Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Total operating revenue increased $5,789.2, or 7.4% to $84,194.0 in 2016, resulting primarily from higher premiums, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees. Higher premiums were largely due to rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends. The increase was further attributable to membership increases in our Medicaid and ACA-compliant off- and on-exchange Individual business product offerings. Additionally, adjustments to accruals for the ACA risk adjustment premium stabilization program and increased reimbursed benefit utilization in our FEP® business contributed to the increase in premiums. The increase in premiums was partially offset by declines in fully-insured membership in our Small Group business and lapses in non-ACA-compliant Individual business product offerings. The increase in administrative fees primarily resulted from membership growth and rate increases for self-funded members in our National Accounts and Large Group businesses.Net investment income increased $101.9, or 15.0%, to $779.5 in 2016, primarily due to higher income from alternative investments. Net realized gains on financial instruments decreased $152.6, or 96.9%, to $4.9 in 2016, primarily due to an increase in net realized losses on derivative financial instruments, largely as a result of losses recognized on options entered in to economically hedge the variability of cash flows in the interest payments on anticipated future financings. The decrease was further due to lower net realized gains on sales of equity securities. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net realized gains on sales of fixed maturity securities.Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments increased $32.0, or 38.4%, to $115.4 in 2016, primarily due to an increase in impairment losses on fixed maturity securities, partially offset by a decrease in impairment losses on equity securities.Benefit expense increased $5,717.5, or 9.4%, to $66,834.4 in 2016, primarily due to increased costs as a result of overall cost trends across our businesses. The increase was further attributable to membership growth in our Medicaid business and ACA-compliant off- and on-exchange Individual business product offerings. These increases were partially offset by the declines in fully-insured membership in our Small Group business and non-ACA-compliant Individual business product offerings.Our benefit expense ratio increased 150 basis points to 84.8% in 2016. The increase in the ratio was largely driven by our Medicaid business due to increases in medical cost experience that exceeded the impact of premium rate adjustments, higher than expected medical cost experience in the Iowa market, which we began serving in 2016, and increases in membership as our Medicaid business has a higher benefit expense ratio than our consolidated average. The increase in the ratio was further due to higher medical costs experience in our Individual and Local Group businesses. These increases were partially offset by adjustments to estimates of prior year accruals related to the ACA risk adjustment premium stabilization program and improved medical cost performance in our Medicare business.Selling, general and administrative expense was $12,557.9 and $12,534.8 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 110 basis points to 14.9% in 2016. The decrease in the ratio was primarily a result of lower costs related to expense efficiency initiatives and the increase in operating revenue, including the impact of Medicaid membership growth in our Government Business segment, which has a lower selling, general and administrative expense ratio than our consolidated average. Other expense increased $41.5, or 4.7%, to $915.3 in 2016, primarily due to higher interest expense in 2016 driven by amortization of the fees incurred for the bridge facility commitment letter and joinder agreement entered into during the third -57-quarter of 2015 to partially fund a portion of the consideration under the now terminated Cigna Merger Agreement. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets.Income tax expense increased $14.6, or 0.7%, to $2,085.6 in 2016. The effective tax rates in 2016 and 2015 were 45.8% and 44.7%, respectively. The increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in non-deductible pre-acquisition costs incurred in connection with the now terminated Cigna Merger Agreement and the increase in our California deferred state tax expense resulting from new legislation in 2016 related to California Managed Care Organizations. The increase was further due to favorable 2015 tax adjustments related to state audit settlements. These increases were partially offset by the non-recurring impact of an adverse California franchise tax ruling recognized in 2015 and a decrease in income before income tax expense. Our net income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 30 basis points to 2.9% in 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of all factors discussed above. Reportable Segments Results of OperationsWe use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, which are Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, and Other. Operating gain, which is a non-GAAP measure, is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense and selling, general and administrative expense. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains on financial instruments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. The discussion of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional information, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, see Note 19, “Segment Information,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, and Other segments’ summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: Change Years Ended December 31 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 2017 2016 2015 $ % $ %Commercial & Specialty Business Operating revenue$40,754.1 $38,692.1 $37,570.8 $2,062.0 5.3 % $1,121.3 3.0 %Operating gain$2,876.1 $3,195.2 $2,854.0 $(319.1) (10.0)% $341.2 12.0 %Operating margin7.1% 8.3% 7.6% (120)bp 70bpGovernment Business Operating revenue$48,276.2 $45,477.7 $40,813.0 $2,798.5 6.2 % $4,664.7 11.4 %Operating gain$1,430.2 $1,784.3 $1,978.5 $(354.1) (19.8)% $(194.2) (9.8)%Operating margin3.0% 3.9% 4.8% (90)bp (90)bpOther Operating revenue1$30.9 $24.2 $21.0 $6.7 27.7 % $3.2 15.2 %Operating loss2$(130.9) $(177.8) $(79.4) $46.9 (26.4)% $(98.4) 123.9 % 1Fluctuations not material.2Fluctuations are primarily a result of changes in unallocated corporate expenses. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to transaction costs incurred associated with the Cigna Merger Agreement. The decrease in 2017 was primarily due to lower transaction costs incurred associated with the Cigna Merger Agreement as a result of the termination of the Cigna Merger Agreement in May 2017.-58-Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Commercial & Specialty BusinessOperating revenue increased $2,062.0, or 5.3%, to $40,754.1 in 2017, primarily due to premium rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends in our Individual and Local Group businesses. The increase was further attributable to membership growth in our fully-insured Large Group business and an increase in administrative fees. The increase in administrative fees was primarily due to membership growth in our self-insured Large Group business. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by the impact of the HIP Fee suspension for 2017, declines in membership in our non-ACA-compliant and ACA-compliant off-exchange Individual businesses, lower favorable adjustments to prior year estimates for the ACA risk adjustment premium stabilization program and declines in membership in our National Accounts business.Operating gain decreased $319.1, or 10.0%, to $2,876.1 in 2017, primarily due to the recognition of the guaranty fund assessment related to the Penn Treaty liquidation, an increase in spend to support our growth initiatives and adjustments to prior year estimates for the ACA risk adjustment premium stabilization program. The decrease in operating gain was further due to an increase in performance-based incentive compensation and the settlement accrual for the class action litigation related to the 2015 cyber attack. The decrease in operating gain was partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative costs related to expense efficiency initiatives and fixed costs leverage from higher operating revenue. The decrease in operating gain was further offset by improved medical cost experience in our Individual businesses.The operating margin in 2017 was 7.1%, a 120 basis point decrease from 2016, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.Government BusinessOperating revenue increased $2,798.5, or 6.2%, to $48,276.2 in 2017. The increase in operating revenue was primarily due to premium rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends in our Medicaid and Medicare businesses. The increase was further due to new Medicaid business expansions and membership growth in our Medicare Advantage business. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the HIP Fee suspension for 2017 and Medicaid membership declines resulting from membership reverification processes and the impact of a new entrant in an existing market.Operating gain decreased $354.1, or 19.8%, to $1,430.2 in 2017, primarily due to the impact of the HIP Fee suspension for 2017 and higher medical cost experience in our Medicare business. The decrease was further due to an increase in performance-based incentive compensation and an increase in spend to support our growth initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative costs related to expense efficiency initiatives and fixed costs leverage from higher operating revenue. The operating margin in 2017 was 3.0%, a 90 basis point decrease from 2016, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Commercial & Specialty BusinessOperating revenue increased $1,121.3, or 3.0%, to $38,692.1 in 2016, primarily due to premium rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends in our Local Group and Individual businesses. The increase was further attributable to adjustments to accruals for the ACA risk adjustment premium stabilization program, membership growth in our ACA-compliant off- and on-exchange Individual business product offerings and increased administrative fees. The increase in administrative fees was primarily due to membership growth and rate increases for self-funded members in our National Accounts and self-funded Large Group businesses. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by declines in fully-insured membership in our Small Group business and lapses in non-ACA-compliant Individual business product offerings.Operating gain increased $341.2, or 12.0%, to $3,195.2 in 2016, primarily due to adjustments to accruals for the ACA risk adjustment premium stabilization program and lower selling, general and administrative expense related to expense efficiency initiatives. The increase was further attributable to membership growth in our National Accounts and self-funded -59-Large Group businesses. These increases were partially offset by higher medical cost experience in our Individual and Local Group businesses and decreases in fully-insured Small Group membership. The operating margin in 2016 was 8.3%, a 70 basis point increase over 2015, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Government BusinessOperating revenue increased $4,664.7, or 11.4%, to $45,477.7 in 2016. The increase in operating revenue was primarily due to increased premiums in our Medicaid business as a result of membership growth through new business expansions and organic growth in existing markets. The increase in operating revenue was also due to rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends in our Medicaid and Medicare businesses and increased premiums in our FEP® business, due to increased reimbursed benefit utilization. Operating gain decreased $194.2, or 9.8%, to $1,784.3 in 2016, primarily due to increases in medical cost experience in our Medicaid business that exceeded the impact of premium rate adjustments and higher than expected medical cost experience in the Iowa Medicaid market, which we began serving in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expense related to expense efficiency initiatives, improved medical cost performance in our Medicare business and the favorable impact of a retroactive change in the minimum MLR calculation under California's Medicaid expansion program. The operating margin in 2016 was 3.9%, a 90 basis point decrease from 2015, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider our most important accounting policies that require significant estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our other significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. Estimates can require a significant amount of judgment and a different set of assumptions could result in material changes to our reported results.Medical Claims PayableThe most subjective accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2017, this liability was $7,991.5 and represented 18.1% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 95.7%, or $7,650.8, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2017; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 4.3%, or $340.7, of the total medical claims payable as of December 31, 2017. The level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period-end to the next, from approximately 1% to 5% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made.Liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in the aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be appropriate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a -60-detailed actuarial process that uses both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period-end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and healthcare trend levels, or “trend factors.” Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison to prior periods, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather, the availability of additional paid claims information drives changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense.We regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are materially different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of healthcare costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable.While there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid claims liability as of December 31, 2017 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations.There is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through twelve months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. In our analysis for the claim liabilities at December 31, 2017, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 40 and 90 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower estimated variability ranging from 0 to 30 basis points.The difference in completion factor assumptions, assuming moderately adverse experience, results in variability of 2%, or approximately $191.0, in the December 31, 2017 incurred but not paid claims liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein.-61-The other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2017 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. In our analysis for the period ended December 31, 2017, there was a 320 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors assuming moderately adverse experience. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 5%, or approximately $376.0, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factors used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claims liability at December 31, 2017. See Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year.” Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. The ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 89.4% for 2017 and 89.1% for both 2016 and 2015. This ratio serves as an indicator of claims processing speed whereby claims were processed slightly faster during 2017 than in both 2016 and 2015.We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2017, this metric was 18.8%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2016 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, this metric was 14.0%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2015, this metric was 15.1%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2014 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2014.We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation supports the reasonableness of our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims and the consistency in our methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2017, this metric was 1.8%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $1,164.6. This metric was 1.4% for both 2016 and 2015. These metrics demonstrate a generally consistent level of reserve conservatism.The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for each of 2016 and 2015 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims – current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims – prior years redundancies” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 2016 2015Total net incurred medical claims, as reported$65,521.0 $59,908.2Retrospective basis, as described above65,206.8 59,858.0Variance$314.2 $50.2Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported0.5% 0.1%Given that our business is primarily short tailed (which means that medical claims are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider), the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with -62-the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2017 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2018.The 2016 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of 0.5% was greater than the 2015 percentage of 0.1%. The lower 2015 variance was driven by a similar level of prior year redundancies in 2016 associated with 2015 claim payments to the prior year redundancies in 2015 associated with 2014 claims payments. Prior year redundancies in 2017 associated with 2016 claim payments were higher by comparison to the previous year, thus creating a higher 2016 variance.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes in accordance with FASB guidance, which requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance.At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following:•the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset;•the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim;•the tax rate at which the deferred tax assets will likely be utilized at in the future;•the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and•any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences.We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits, as required by the guidance. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted.In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we intend to defend our positions vigorously through the federal, state and local appeals processes. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact on our results of operations or financial condition from these matters.For additional information, see Note 7, “Income Taxes,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsOur consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2017 was $19,231.2 and other intangible assets were $8,368.4. The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets represented 39.1% of our total consolidated assets and 104.1% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2017.We follow FASB guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. -63-Furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, which include goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately.We complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. These tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Certain interim impairment tests are also performed when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur.Fair value is estimated using the projected income and market valuation approaches for goodwill at the reporting unit level and the projected income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. Use of the projected income and market valuation approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. The projected income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. These estimated future cash flows are then discounted. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted-average cost of capital. Market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including revenue, EBITDA, and book value of invested capital (debt and equity) and include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry.We did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2017 annual impairment tests, as the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying values as of December 31, 2017. Additionally, we do not believe that the estimated fair values of our reporting units are at risk of becoming impaired in the next twelve months. However, as a result of certain provisions of the ACA, we have experienced lower operating margins in certain lines of business. Those margins could become further compressed with adverse changes in federal and state laws and regulations. As a result, the estimated fair values of certain of our reporting units with goodwill could fall below their carrying values in future periods and if that were to occur, we would be required to record impairment losses at that time.While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.For additional information, see Note 3, ""Business Acquisitions"" and Note 9, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Investments Current and long-term available-for-sale investment securities were $21,570.1 at December 31, 2017 and represented 30.6% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2017. We classify fixed maturity and equity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” or “trading” and report those securities at fair value. Certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity.We review investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. In addition, for equity securities, we determine whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time to allow for a -64-recovery of its fair value above its carrying amount. If any declines of equity securities are determined to be other-than-temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made.Certain FASB other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, guidance applies to fixed maturity securities and provides guidance on the recognition, presentation of, and disclosures for OTTIs. If a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and is presented within the other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income line item on our consolidated statements of income. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, the credit component of the OTTI is presented within the other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income line item on our consolidated statements of income and the non-credit component of the OTTI is recognized in other comprehensive income. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The credit component of an OTTI is determined primarily by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of acquisition. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings, and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default.We have a committee of accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. This could result in OTTI losses on investments being charged against future income. Given the uncertainty of future market conditions, as well as the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and material OTTI losses on investments may be recorded in future periods.In addition to available-for-sale investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $3,343.8, or 4.7% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2017. These long-term investments consisted primarily of certain other equity investments, the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and real estate. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term.Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits on investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future results of operations and financial condition. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $17,938.1 at December 31, 2017. The weighted-average credit rating of these securities was “A” as of December 31, 2017. Included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions, investments in mortgage-backed securities and investments in corporate securities of $1,205.1, $0.8 and $0.7, respectively, that are guaranteed by third parties. With the exception of nineteen securities with a fair value of $17.5, these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of “A” as of December 31, 2017. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors, and we do not have any material exposure to any single guarantor, neither indirectly through the guarantees, nor directly through investment in the guarantor. Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of the fixed maturity securities without a guarantee, for which such information is available, was “A” as of December 31, 2017.Fair values of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with FASB guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. We have -65-controls in place to review the pricing services’ qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. In addition, we periodically review the pricing services’ pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable.We obtain only one quoted price for each security from the pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in these valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform monthly analysis on the prices received from the pricing services to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes a review of month-to-month price fluctuations. If unusual fluctuations are noted in this review, we may obtain additional information from other pricing services to validate the quoted price. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from the pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.In certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. Such securities are designated Level III in accordance with FASB guidance. Securities designated Level III at December 31, 2017 totaled $537.5 and represented approximately 2.2% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level III securities primarily consisted of certain corporate securities, equity securities and structured securities for which observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using internal estimates for inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields.For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” and Part II, Item 8, Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” Note 4, “Investments,” and Note 6, “Fair Value,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Retirement Benefits Pension BenefitsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for some of our employees. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FASB guidance for retirement benefits, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by the guidance, we calculate the value of plan assets as described below. Further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods. An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our December 31, 2017 measurement date, we selected a weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.83%. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and an average of historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase.This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. We apply a corridor approach to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. Under this approach, only accumulated net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the average remaining service or lifetime of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. -66-The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date. At the December 31, 2017 measurement date, we changed the discount rate setting methodology from the single equivalent discount rate to the annual spot rate approach. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot rates from a full yield curve of published rates are used to discount each plan’s cash flows to determine the plan’s obligation. The spot rate approach produces a more precise measure of service and interest cost, and results in obligations that are equal at the measurement date under both methods. The weighted-average discount rate under the annual spot rate approach was 3.44% at the December 31, 2017 measurement date. The weighted-average discount rate under the single equivalent discount rate approach was 3.77% at the December 31, 2016 measurement date. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FASB guidance.In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities, equity securities and alternative investments across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow.Other Postretirement BenefitsWe provide most associates with certain medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate and the expected trend in healthcare costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits.At our December 31, 2017 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 3.42% using the annual spot rate approach. At our December 31, 2016 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 3.82% using the single equivalent discount rate approach. The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of pre-Medicare (those who are not currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2017 measurement date was 8.00% for 2018 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2028. The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of post-Medicare (those who are currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2017 measurement date was 6.00% for 2018 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2028. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The healthcare cost trend rate assumption affects the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 by $35.0 and would increase service and interest costs by $1.6. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 by $30.3 and would decrease service and interest costs by $1.4. For additional information regarding our retirement benefits, see Note 10, “Retirement Benefits,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.New Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended December 31, 2017 that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures, see the “Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance” and “Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted” sections of Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesIntroductionOur cash receipts result primarily from premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases -67-of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity.We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy.A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations.The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. The securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility, although current market conditions are more stable. During recent years, the federal government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to improve liquidity in the financial markets and strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. In addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide liquidity and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions. We have a $2,500.0 commercial paper program. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we have the ability to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our $3,500.0 senior revolving credit facility to redeem any outstanding commercial paper upon maturity. Additionally, we believe the lenders participating in our credit facility would be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. In addition to the $3,500.0 senior revolving credit facility, we estimate that we will receive approximately $2,200.0 of dividends from our subsidiaries during 2018, which also provides further operating and financial flexibility. The table below outlines the cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities$4,184.8 $3,270.2 $4,211.9Investing activities(5,082.4) (513.9) (1,151.5)Financing activities426.9 (798.6) (3,093.3)Effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents4.3 4.1 (5.3)(Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents$(466.4) $1,961.8 $(38.2)Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016 During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $4,184.8, compared to $3,270.2 for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $914.6. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in premium receipts as a result of both rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends, and growth in membership. The increase in cash flow was partially offset by an increase in claims payments due to higher medical cost experience and growth in membership. The increase was further offset by an increase in spend to support our growth initiatives, the timing of provider capitation payments for pass-through funding under the California Medicaid contract and the timing of certain state Medicaid payments.-68-Net cash flow used in investing activities was $5,082.4 during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $513.9 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash flow used in investing activities of $4,568.5 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of investments, the acquisition of HealthSun and an increase in purchases of property and equipment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in collateral held under our securities lending programs.Net cash flow provided by financing activities was $426.9 during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net cash flow used in financing activities of $798.6 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flow from financing activities of $1,225.5 primarily resulted from an increase in net proceeds from long-term, short-term and commercial paper borrowings, a decrease in payments on debt-related derivatives and an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. These sources of cash were partially offset by cash used for the repurchase of common stock in 2017, an increase in repayments of collateral under our securities lending programs and a decrease in bank overdrafts.Liquidity— Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 During the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $3,270.2, compared to $4,211.9 for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $941.7. The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in claims payments due to higher medical cost experience and growth in membership. The decrease was further due to the timing of claim reimbursements from our self-insured customers. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in premium receipts as a result of rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and growth in membership. The decrease was further offset by an increase in pharmacy rebates received.Net cash flow used in investing activities was $513.9 during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1,151.5 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in cash flow used in investing activities of $637.6 was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for the purchase of subsidiaries, as net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 included the purchase of Simply Healthcare while there were no purchases of subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in net purchases of investments.Net cash flow used in financing activities was $798.6 during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $3,093.3 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in cash flow used in financing activities of $2,294.7 primarily resulted from a decrease in common stock repurchases, as we did not repurchase any common stock during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was further due to a reduction in net repayments of short- and long-term borrowings and changes in bank overdrafts. The decrease in cash flow used in financing activities was partially offset by changes in commercial paper borrowings, payments on debt-related derivatives in 2016, a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans and a decrease in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. Financial ConditionWe maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities of $25,179.0 at December 31, 2017. Since December 31, 2016, total cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $1,916.3 primarily due to cash generated from operations, net proceeds obtained from long- and short-term borrowings, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans and net proceeds received from commercial paper borrowings. These increases were partially offset by cash used for the purchase of HealthSun, repurchases of common stock, cash dividends paid to shareholders, purchases of property and equipment and collateral payments and settlements of debt-related derivatives.Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Certain accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities, or statutory accounting practices, differ from GAAP. Changes that occur in statutory accounting practices, if any, could impact our subsidiaries' future dividend capacity. In addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries.At December 31, 2017, we held $2,759.8 of cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company, which are available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, potential future common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders, repurchases of debt securities and debt and interest payments. -69-DebtWe generally issue senior unsecured notes, or Notes, for long-term borrowing purposes. Certain of these Notes may have a call feature that allows us to redeem the Notes at any time at our option and/or a put feature that allows a Note holder to redeem the Notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating. On December 14, 2017, we redeemed the $255.2 remaining outstanding principal balance of our 7.000% Notes due 2019, plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, for cash totaling $275.0. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $14.3 for the repurchase of these notes. On November 21, 2017, we issued $900.0 aggregate principal amount of 2.500% Notes due 2020, $750.0 aggregate principal amount of 2.950% Notes due 2022, $850.0 aggregate principal amount of 3.350% Notes due 2024, $1,600.0 aggregate principal amount of 3.650% Notes due 2027 and $1,400.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Notes due 2047 under our shelf registration statement. Interest on the 2020 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 21 and November 21 of each year, commencing on May 21, 2018. Interest on the 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 2027 Notes and the 2047 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2018. The net proceeds were used to fund the acquisitions of HealthSun and America's 1st Choice; redemption of the 7.000% Notes due 2019, discussed above; and redemption of the Tender Notes, discussed below. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. On November 14, 2017, we initiated a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of our 7.000% Notes due 2019, or the Any and All Notes, and certain of our 5.950% Notes due 2034, 5.850% Notes due 2036, 6.375% Notes due 2037, 5.800% Notes due 2040 and 5.100% Notes due 2044, or the Maximum Tender Offer Notes, and collectively with the Any and All Notes, the Tender Notes. On November 21, 2017, we repurchased $185.1 aggregate principal amount of the Any and All Notes, plus applicable premium and accrued and unpaid interest, for cash totaling $199.4. On November 30, 2017, we repurchased $836.3 aggregate principal amount of the Maximum Tender Offer Notes, plus applicable premium and accrued and unpaid interest, for cash totaling $1,095.4. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $265.6 for the repurchase of the Tender Notes. On June 15, 2017 and February 15, 2017, we repaid, upon maturity, the $528.8 outstanding balance of our 5.875% Notes and the $400.0 outstanding balance of our 2.375% Notes, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, $117.3 of the aggregate principal balance of our outstanding senior convertible debentures due 2042, or the Debentures, were surrendered for conversion by certain holders. We elected to settle the excess of the principal amount of the conversions with cash for total payments of $344.8. We recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt related to the Debentures of $2.5, based on the fair values of the debt on the conversion settlement dates. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased $920.0 in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures. In addition, $66.6 aggregate principal amount was surrendered for conversion. We elected to settle the excess of the principal amount of the repurchases and conversions with cash for total payments of $2,055.7 and recognized a gain on the extinguishment of debt of $12.7. There were no repurchases or material conversions during the year ended December 31, 2016.On September 10, 2015, we repaid, upon maturity, the $625.0 outstanding principal balance of our 1.25% senior unsecured notes due 2015. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased $13.0 of outstanding principal balance of certain other senior unsecured notes, plus applicable premium, accrued and unpaid interest, for cash totaling $16.2. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.4 on the repurchase of these notes.On May 12, 2015, we issued 25.0 Equity Units, pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated May 6, 2015, in an aggregate principal amount of $1,250.0. Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $50 (whole dollars) and consists of a purchase contract obligating the holder to purchase a certain number of shares of our common stock on May 1, 2018, subject to earlier termination or settlement, for a price in cash of $50 (whole dollars); and a 5% undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 (whole dollars) principal amount of our 1.900% remarketable subordinated notes, due 2028. We received $1,228.8 in cash proceeds from the issuance of the Equity Units, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us, and recorded $1,250.0 in long-term debt. -70-For additional information related to our borrowing activities, see Note 12, “Debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We calculate our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, a non-GAAP measure, from the amounts presented on our audited consolidated balance sheets included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as the sum of short-term borrowings, plus current portion of long-term debt, plus long-term debt, less current portion, divided by the sum of short-term borrowings, plus current portion of long-term debt, plus long-term debt, less current portion, plus total shareholders’ equity. We believe our debt-to-capital ratio assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. In addition, our bank covenants include a maximum debt-to-capital ratio that we cannot and did not exceed. Our debt-to-capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio was 42.9% and 38.5% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our senior debt is rated “A” by S&P Global, “BBB” by Fitch Ratings, Inc., “Baa2” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by limitations on future borrowings and a potential increase in our borrowing costs.Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity We have a shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries and the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion.We have a senior revolving credit facility, or the Facility, with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. The Facility provides credit up to $3,500.0 and matures on August 25, 2020. The interest rate on the Facility is based on either the LIBOR rate or a base rate plus a predetermined rate based on our public debt rating at the date of utilization. Our ability to borrow under the Facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. There were no amounts outstanding under the Facility at December 31, 2017 or 2016.In August 2017, we entered into two separate 364-day lines of credit with separate lenders for general corporate purposes. The facilities provide combined credit up to $450.0. The interest rate on each line of credit is based on the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined rate. Our ability to borrow under the lines of credit is subject to compliance with certain covenants. We had $450.0 outstanding under these lines of credit at December 31, 2017. We have an authorized commercial paper program of up to $2,500.0, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $803.6 and $629.0, respectively, of borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program. Commercial paper borrowings are classified as long-term debt as our general practice and intent is to replace short-term commercial paper outstanding at expiration with additional short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one year, and we have the ability to redeem our commercial paper with borrowings under the Facility described above. We are a member, through certain subsidiaries, of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, collectively, the FHLBs, and as a member we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, $825.0 and $440.0, respectively, were outstanding under our short-term FHLBs borrowings.During the year ended December 31, 2015, we entered into a bridge facility commitment letter and a joinder agreement, and a term loan facility, to finance a portion of the consideration under the now terminated Cigna Merger Agreement. In January 2017, we reduced the size of the bridge facility from $22,500.0 to $19,500.0 and extended the termination date under the Cigna Merger Agreement, as well as the availability of commitments under the bridge facility and term loan facility, to April 30, 2017. We recorded $107.9, $104.0 and $36.8 of interest expense related to the amortization of the bridge loan facility and other related fees during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The commitment of the lenders to provide the bridge facility and term loan facility expired on April 30, 2017. -71-As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we are currently estimating approximately $2,200.0 of dividends to be paid to the parent company during 2018. During 2017, we received $2,268.0 of dividends from our subsidiaries.We regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions, common stock and debt security repurchases and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.A summary of the cash dividend activity for the year ended December 31, 2017 is as follows:Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date CashDividendper Share TotalFebruary 22, 2017 March 10, 2017 March 24, 2017 $0.65 $172.2April 27, 2017 June 9, 2017 June 23, 2017 0.65 171.8July 25, 2017 September 8, 2017 September 25, 2017 0.70 181.4October 24, 2017 December 5, 2017 December 21, 2017 0.70 179.5On January 30, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $0.75 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on March 23, 2018 to the shareholders of record as of March 9, 2018.Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. On December 7, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized a $5,000.0 increase to the common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. The repurchases are effected from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase agreements, and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares under the program when we believe it is a prudent use of capital. The excess cost of the repurchased shares over par value is charged on a pro rata basis to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. A summary of common stock repurchases for the period January 1, 2018 through February 9, 2018 (subsequent to December 31, 2017) and for the year ended December 31, 2017 is as follows: January 1, 2018throughFebruary 9, 2018 Year EndedDecember 31,2017Shares repurchased0.7 10.5Average price per share$237.35 $189.93Aggregate cost$156.6 $1,997.7Authorization remaining at the end of each period$7,021.5 $7,178.1There were no common stock repurchases in 2016. We expect to utilize the remaining authorized amount over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions. -72-Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsOur estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017 are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 YearsOn-Balance Sheet: Debt1 $29,967.1 $4,013.6 $3,685.7 $3,374.9 $18,892.9Other long-term liabilities2 1,186.8 47.5 414.2 384.1 341.0Off-Balance Sheet: Purchase obligations31,747.5 995.5 671.5 70.8 9.7Operating lease commitments898.5 154.5 269.4 188.6 286.0Investment commitments4823.8 255.2 360.6 168.4 39.6Total contractual obligations and commitments$34,623.7 $5,466.3 $5,401.4 $4,186.8 $19,569.2 1Includes estimated interest expense. 2Primarily consists of reserves for future policy benefits, projected other postretirement benefits, deferred compensation, supplemental executive retirement plan liabilities and certain other miscellaneous long-term obligations. Estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from this table as we had no funding requirements under ERISA at December 31, 2017 as a result of the value of the assets in the plans. 3Includes estimated payments for future services under contractual arrangements from third-party service contracts.4Includes unfunded capital commitments for alternative investments.The above table does not contain $211.5 of gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions and interest for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities. For further information, see Note 7, “Income Taxes,” to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our Facility and/or from public or private financing sources, will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet derivative instruments, guarantee transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements or any indemnification agreements that will require funding in future periods. We have not transferred assets to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not hold any variable interest in an unconsolidated entity where such entity provides us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support.Risk-Based CapitalOur regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies and health maintenance organizations largely based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, Risk-Based Capital (RBC) For Health Organizations Model Act, or RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under the RBC Model Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our regulated subsidiaries' -73-respective RBC levels as of December 31, 2017, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, were in excess of all mandatory RBC requirements. In addition to exceeding the RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries.For additional information, see Note 21, “Statutory Information,"" to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. (In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein)As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2017. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return.InvestmentsOur investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk.The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit event, such as a ratings downgrade or default, to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that event. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately “A.” Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which have exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value.Our available-for-sale investment portfolio includes corporate securities which account for 34.7% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2017 and are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price -74-of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. We manage this risk through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of our corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately “BBB.”Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities, exchange-traded funds and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systemic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio.As of December 31, 2017, 83.2% of our available-for-sale investments were fixed maturity securities. Market risk is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $829.9 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $844.5 increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and the duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly.As of December 31, 2017, 16.8% of our available-for-sale investments were equity securities. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $363.2. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $363.2.For additional information regarding our investments, see Part II, Item 8, Note 4, “Investments,” to our audited consolidated financial statements and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Investments” within Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Long-Term DebtOur total long-term debt at December 31, 2017 consists of senior unsecured notes, remarketable subordinated notes, convertible debentures, commercial paper and subordinated surplus notes by one of our insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2017, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $18,656.8 and $20,834.4, respectively. This debt is subject to interest rate risk as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. For additional information regarding our long-term debt, see Note 6, ""Fair Value"" and Note 12, “Debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Derivatives We have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts, which are used to lock-in interest rates or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. We have used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities.Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these derivatives. As of December 31, 2017, we recorded a net liability of $12.2, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swaps' fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $63.6 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $63.6 increase in fair value.For additional information regarding our derivatives, see Note 5, “Derivative Financial Instruments” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. -75-",2023-12-30 18:53:28.986260
1156039,ELV,"Elevance Health, Inc.",2019,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein) This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. References to the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Anthem” or the “Company” used throughout this MD&A refer to Anthem, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and, unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries. References to the “states” include the District of Columbia, unless the context otherwise requires.OverviewWe are one of the largest health benefits companies in the United States in terms of medical membership, serving approximately 40 medical members through our affiliated health plans as of December 31, 2018. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or BCBS, licensee for Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (in the New York City metropolitan area and upstate New York), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas, we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield or Empire Blue Cross. We also conduct business through arrangements with other BCBS licensees in Louisiana, South Carolina and western New York. Through our subsidiaries, we also serve customers in over 25 states across the country as America’s 1st Choice, Amerigroup, Aspire Health, CareMore, Freedom Health, HealthLink, HealthSun, Optimum HealthCare, Simply Healthcare, and/or UniCare. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia through our subsidiaries. We manage our operations through three reportable segments: Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business and Other. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we reclassified certain ancillary businesses to align how our segments are currently being managed. Prior year amounts have been reclassified for comparability.Our operating revenue consists of premiums and administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue comes from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. Administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, or where the fee is based on either processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized. Additionally, we earn administrative fee revenues from our Medicare processing business and from other health-related businesses including disease management programs. Other revenue includes miscellaneous income other than premium revenue and administrative fees.Our benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our fully-insured members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. While we offer a diversified mix of managed care products and services through our managed care plans, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products and services. Our managed care plans include: Preferred Provider Organizations, or PPOs; Health Maintenance Organizations, or HMOs; Point-of-Service plans, or POS plans; traditional indemnity plans and other hybrid plans, including Consumer-Driven Health Plans, or CDHPs; and hospital only and limited benefit products. We classify certain claims-related costs as benefit expense to reflect costs incurred for our members’ traditional medical care, as well as those expenses which improve our members’ health and medical outcomes. These claims-related costs may be comprised of expenses incurred for: (i) medical management, including case and prospective utilization management; (ii) health and wellness, including disease management services for such conditions as diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, -42-congestive heart failure and asthma management and wellness initiatives like weight-loss programs and smoking cessation treatments; and (iii) clinical health policy such as identification and use of best clinical practices to avoid harm, identifying clinical errors and safety concerns, and identifying potential adverse drug interactions. These types of claims-related costs are designed to ultimately lower our members’ cost of care. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Commission expense generally varies with premium or membership volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels and thus, associated compensation expense. Other variable costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity.Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage healthcare costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management and health and wellness programs. Several economic factors related to healthcare costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating healthcare costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers and any regulatory or market-driven restrictions on our ability to obtain adequate premium rates to offset overall inflation in healthcare costs, including increases in unit costs and utilization resulting from the aging of the population and other demographics, as well as advances in medical technology, may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. For additional information about our business and reportable segments, see Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 19, “Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Business TrendsThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, as amended, or collectively, the ACA, has changed and may continue to make broad-based changes to the U.S. healthcare system, which we expect will continue to impact our business model and strategy. Also, the legal challenges regarding the ACA, including the ultimate outcome of the December 2018 decision of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division invalidating the ACA (the “2018 Texas District Court ACA Decision”), which judgment has been stayed pending appeal, could significantly disrupt our business. During 2018, we strategically reduced our participation in the Individual ACA-compliant market. Our strategy has been, and will continue to be, to only participate in rating regions where we have an appropriate level of confidence that these markets are on a path toward sustainability, including, but not limited to, factors such as expected financial performance, regulatory environment, and underlying market characteristics. We currently offer Individual ACA-compliant products in 73 of the 143 rating regions in which we operate.In October 2017, we established a new pharmacy benefits manager, or PBM, called IngenioRx, and entered into a five-year agreement with CaremarkPCS Health, L.L.C., or CVS Health, which is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corporation, to begin offering PBM solutions upon the conclusion of our current PBM Agreement with Express Scripts Inc., or Express Scripts. The twelve-month transition period to migrate the services from Express Scripts begins March 2, 2019, at which time CVS Health can begin providing certain PBM services to IngenioRx. We expect IngenioRx to provide our members with more cost-effective solutions and improve our ability to integrate pharmacy benefits within our already strong medical and specialty platform.Pricing Trends: We strive to price our healthcare benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends. We frequently make adjustments to respond to legislative and regulatory changes as well as pricing and other actions taken by existing competitors and new market entrants. Product pricing in our Commercial & Specialty Business segment, including our Individual and Small Group lines of business, remains competitive. The ACA imposed an annual Health Insurance Provider Fee, or HIP Fee, on health insurers that write certain types of health insurance on U.S. risks. We price our affected products to cover the impact of the HIP Fee. The HIP Fee was suspended for 2019 and is scheduled to resume for 2020.-43-Revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government and/or applicable state governments. Medical Cost Trends: Our medical cost trends are primarily driven by increases in the utilization of services across all provider types and the unit cost increases of these services. We work to mitigate these trends through various medical management programs such as utilization management, condition management, program integrity and specialty pharmacy management, as well as benefit design changes. There are many drivers of medical cost trends that can cause variance from our estimates, such as changes in the level and mix of services utilized, regulatory changes, aging of the population, health status and other demographic characteristics of our members, epidemics, advances in medical technology, new high cost prescription drugs, and healthcare provider or member fraud. Our underlying Local Group medical cost trends reflect the “allowed amount,” or contractual rate, paid to providers. We estimate that our aggregate cost of care trend was slightly below the midpoint of our 5.5% to 6.5% range for the full year of 2018. We anticipate the Local Group medical cost trend will be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% in 2019.For additional discussion regarding business trends, see Part I, Item 1 “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesThe ACA presented us with new growth opportunities, but also introduced new risks, regulatory challenges and uncertainties, and required changes in the way products are designed, underwritten, priced, distributed and administered. Changes to our business environment are likely to continue for the next several years as elected officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to existing laws and regulations, including the reduction of the individual mandate penalty to zero effective January 1, 2019, elimination of funding for cost-sharing subsidies made available for qualified individuals, and changes to taxes and fees. In addition, the legal challenges regarding the ACA, including the ultimate outcome of the 2018 Texas District Court ACA Decision, continue to contribute to this uncertainty. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the ACA as additional guidance is made available and any further developments or judicial rulings occur.The annual HIP Fee is allocated to health insurers based on the ratio of the amount of an insurer’s net premium revenues written during the preceding calendar year to the amount of health insurance premium for all U.S. health risk for those certain lines of business written during the preceding calendar year. We record our estimated liability for the HIP Fee in full at the beginning of the year with a corresponding deferred asset that is amortized on a straight-line basis to selling, general and administrative expense. The final calculation and payment of the annual HIP Fee is due by September 30th of each fee year. The HIP Fee is non-deductible for federal income tax purposes. We price our affected products to cover the increased selling, general and administrative and income tax expenses associated with the HIP Fee. The total amount due from allocations to health insurers was $14,300 for 2018, and we recognized $1,544 as selling, general and administrative expense related to the HIP Fee. There was no corresponding expense for 2017 due to the suspension of the HIP Fee for 2017. The HIP Fee is suspended for 2019 and scheduled to resume for 2020.As a result of the ACA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, issued Medical Loss Ratio, or MLR, regulations that require us to meet minimum MLR thresholds of 85% for Large Group and 80% for Small Group and Individual lines of business. Plans that do not meet the minimum thresholds have to pay a MLR rebate. For purposes of determining MLR rebates, HHS has defined the types of costs that should be included in the MLR rebate calculation. However, certain components of the MLR calculation as defined by HHS cannot be classified consistently under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. While considered benefit expense or a reduction of premium revenue by HHS, certain of these costs are classified as other types of expense, such as selling, general and administrative expense or income tax expense, in our GAAP basis financial statements. Accordingly, the benefit expense ratio determined using our consolidated GAAP operating results is not comparable to the MLR calculated under HHS regulations.The ACA also imposed a separate minimum MLR threshold of 85% for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, or Medicare Part D. Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D plans that do not meet this threshold have to pay an MLR rebate. If a plan’s MLR is below 85% for three consecutive years beginning with 2014, enrollment is restricted. A Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D plan contract will be terminated if the plan’s MLR is below 85% for five consecutive years.-44-For additional discussion regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, and risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Regulation” and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors.”Other Significant Items or TransactionsIn October 2017, we established IngenioRx and entered into a five-year agreement with CVS Health to begin offering PBM solutions (the “CVS PBM Agreement”), which coincides with the conclusion of our current PBM agreement with Express Scripts (the “ESI PBM Agreement”). In January 2019, we exercised our contractual right to terminate the ESI PBM Agreement earlier than the original expiration date of December 31, 2019 due to the recent acquisition of Express Scripts by Cigna Corporation, or Cigna. As a result of exercising our early termination right, the ESI PBM Agreement will now terminate on March 1, 2019, and the twelve-month transition period to migrate the services begins on March 2, 2019. At that time CVS Health is able to begin providing certain PBM services to IngenioRx pursuant to the CVS PBM Agreement. Notwithstanding our termination of the ESI PBM Agreement, the litigation between us and Express Scripts regarding the ESI PBM Agreement continues. In March 2016, we filed a lawsuit against Express Scripts seeking to recover damages for pharmacy pricing that is higher than competitive benchmark pricing and damages related to operational breaches. Express Scripts filed an answer to the lawsuit disputing our contractual claims and alleging various defenses and counterclaims. For additional information regarding this lawsuit, see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings - Express Scripts, Inc. Pharmacy Benefit Management Litigation,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.On February 15, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Freedom Health, Inc., Optimum HealthCare, Inc., America’s 1st Choice of South Carolina, Inc. and related entities, or collectively, America’s 1st Choice, a Medicare Advantage organization that offers HMO products, including Chronic Special Needs Plans and Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plans under its Freedom Health and Optimum HealthCare brands in Florida and its America’s 1st Choice of South Carolina brand in South Carolina. At the time of acquisition, through its Medicare Advantage Plans, America’s 1st Choice served approximately one hundred and thirty-five thousand members in 25 Florida and 3 South Carolina counties. This acquisition aligned with our plans for continued growth in the Medicare Advantage and Special Needs populations.In December 2017, we acquired HealthSun Health Plans, Inc., or HealthSun, which at the time of acquisition served approximately forty thousand members in the state of Florida through its Medicare Advantage plans, and which received a five-star rating from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This acquisition aligned with our plans for continued growth in the Medicare Advantage and dual-eligible populations.For additional information related to the acquisitions of America’s 1st Choice and HealthSun, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In May 2017, we announced that we were terminating the Agreement and Plan of Merger, or Cigna Merger Agreement, between us and Cigna. Both we and Cigna have commenced litigation against the other seeking various actions and damages, including Cigna’s damage claim for a $1,850 termination fee pursuant to the terms of the Cigna Merger Agreement. For additional information about the ongoing litigation related to the Cigna Merger Agreement, see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings - Cigna Corporation Merger Litigation,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other significant transactions in recent years that have impacted or will impact our capital structure or that have influenced or will influence how we conduct our business operations include our Board of Directors’ declarations of dividends on our common stock (2013 through January 2019), repurchases of our common stock (2019 and prior), and debt repurchases and new debt issuances (2018 and prior). For additional information regarding these transactions, see Note 12, “Debt” and Note 14, “Capital Stock,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Operating PerformanceOperating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $91,341, an increase of $2,280, or 2.6%, from the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in operating revenue was primarily a result of higher premium revenue in our -45-Government Business segment, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees and other revenue in our Commercial & Specialty Business segment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in premium revenue in our Commercial & Specialty Business segment.Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3,750, a decrease of $93, or 2.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net income was primarily a result of higher income tax expense, net realized losses on investments and increased amortization of other intangible assets. The decrease in net income was partially offset by higher operating results in both our Commercial & Specialty Business and Government Business segments, lower realized losses on extinguishment of debt and an increase in net earnings from investment activities.Our fully-diluted earnings per share, or EPS, for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $14.19, a decrease of $0.16, or 1.1%, from the year ended December 31, 2017. Our diluted shares for the year ended December 31, 2018 were 264.2, a decrease of 3.6, or 1.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in EPS resulted from the decrease in net income, partially offset by the lower number of shares outstanding in 2018.Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3,827, or 1.0 times net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $4,185, or 1.1 times net income. The decrease in operating cash flow from 2017 of $358 was primarily due to increased spend to support growth initiatives and the impact of membership declines due to our reduced participation in ACA-compliant Individual marketplaces, and to a lesser extent, membership declines in our fully-insured Local Group business. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by cash receipts related to rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends. The decrease was further offset by lower income taxes paid in 2018 as a result of the tax bill, H.R.1, An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, or the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted by the federal government on December 22, 2017. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.Our results of operations discussed throughout this MD&A are determined in accordance with GAAP. We also calculate operating gain, a non-GAAP measure, to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results. We define operating revenue as premium income and administrative fees and other revenues. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense and selling, general and administrative expense. We use these measures as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, forecasting future operating periods and setting incentive compensation targets. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income before income tax expense, net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional details on operating gain, see our “Reportable Segments Results of Operations” discussion included in this MD&A. For a reconciliation of reportable segment operating revenue to the amounts of total revenue included in the consolidated statements of income and a reconciliation of reportable segment operating gain to income before income tax expense, see Note 19, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We intend to expand through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and efficient use of capital in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale, as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. In 2018, we reduced our participation in the Individual ACA-compliant market. In all other markets, we have maintained our position or achieved growth as a result of strategic mergers and acquisitions, as well as organic growth resulting from delivering excellent service, offering competitively priced products, providing access to high-quality provider networks and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks.-46-Membership Our medical membership includes seven different customer types: Local Group, Individual, National Accounts, BlueCard®, Medicare, Medicaid and FEP®. BCBS-branded business generally refers to members in our service areas licensed by the BCBSA. Non-BCBS-branded business refers to members in our non-BCBS-branded America’s 1st Choice, Amerigroup, CareMore, HealthSun, and Simply Healthcare plans, as well as HealthLink and UniCare members. In addition to the above medical membership, we also serve customers who purchase one or more of our other products or services that are often ancillary to our health business.•Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. In addition, Local Group includes UniCare members. Local Group accounts are generally sold through brokers or consultants working with industry specialists from our in-house sales force and are offered both on and off the public exchanges. Local Group insurance premiums may be based on claims incurred by the group or sold on a self-insured basis. The customer’s buying decision is typically based upon the size and breadth of our networks, customer service, the quality of our medical management services, the administrative cost included in our quoted price, our financial stability, our reputation and our ability to effectively service large complex accounts. Local Group accounted for 39.4%, 39.4% and 38.6% of our medical members at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.•Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. Individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, retail partnerships, our in-house sales force or via the exchanges. Individual business is sold on a fully-insured basis. We offer on-exchange products through public exchanges and off-exchange products. Federal premium subsidies are available only for certain public exchange Individual products. Unsubsidized Individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network and the efficiency of administration. Customer turnover is generally higher with Individual as compared to Local Group. Individual business accounted for 1.6%, 3.9% and 4.2% of our medical members at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.•National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in an Anthem service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker and consultant relationships. Service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. National Accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. We believe we have an advantage when competing for very large National Accounts due to the size and breadth of our networks and our ability to access the national provider networks of BCBS companies at their competitive local market rates. National Accounts represented 19.0%, 18.5% and 18.8% of our medical members at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.•BlueCard® host customers represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by Anthem who receive healthcare services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard® membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard® program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which an Anthem subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-Anthem controlled BCBSA licensee (i.e., the “home plan”). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard® members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard® members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard® claims received per month. BlueCard® host membership accounted for 14.6%, 14.2% and 14.5% of our medical members at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.•Medicare customers are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Supplement plans; Medicare Advantage, including Special Needs Plans; Medicare Part D; and dual-eligible programs through Medicare-Medicaid Plans, or MMPs. Medicare Supplement plans typically pay the difference between healthcare costs incurred by a beneficiary and amounts paid by Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans provide Medicare beneficiaries with a managed care alternative to traditional Medicare and often include a Medicare Part D benefit. In addition, our Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plans provide tailored benefits to Medicare beneficiaries who have chronic diseases and also cover certain dual-eligible customers, who are low-income seniors -47-and persons under age 65 with disabilities. Medicare Advantage membership also includes Employer Group Medicare Advantage members who are related to National Accounts or retired members of Local Group accounts who have selected a Medicare Advantage product. Medicare Part D offers a prescription drug plan to Medicare and MMP beneficiaries. MMP, which was established as a result of the passage of the ACA, is a demonstration program focused on serving members who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. Medicare business accounted for 4.6%, 3.9% and 3.6% of our medical members at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.•Medicaid membership represents eligible members who receive healthcare benefits through publicly funded healthcare programs, including Medicaid, ACA-related Medicaid expansion programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, programs for seniors and people with disabilities, Children’s Health Insurance Programs, and specialty programs such as those focused on long-term services and support, HIV/AIDS, foster care, behavioral health and/or substance abuse disorders, and intellectual disabilities or developmental disabilities, among others. Total Medicaid program business accounted for 16.8%, 16.1% and 16.4% of our medical members at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.•FEP® members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. FEP® business accounted for 3.9% of our medical members at each of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two principal funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ healthcare costs. Some self-funded customers choose to purchase stop loss coverage to limit their retained risk.During the fourth quarter of 2018 we made a number of changes to our membership reporting to better align our reported membership to the appropriate type, funding arrangement and segment, including movement of our Employer Group Medicare Advantage members from National Accounts to Medicare Advantage, reclassification of these Employer Group members from the Commercial & Specialty Business segment to our Government Business segment, and other marginal changes.-48-The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Our reduced participation in ACA-compliant marketplaces led to the decreases in our Individual and fully-insured memberships. This decrease in fully-insured membership was partially offset by an increase in Medicare membership as a result of our America’s 1st Choice acquisition and higher sales during open enrollment. Self-funded medical membership increased due to -49-increases in our National Accounts and Large Group businesses and higher activity from BlueCard® membership. Local Group membership decreased as a result of competitive pressures in fully-insured membership, partially offset by new sales and growth in our existing self-funded business. National Accounts membership increased primarily due to new sales and growth from existing contracts exceeding lapses. BlueCard® membership increased primarily due to higher membership activity at other BCBSA plans whose members reside in or travel to our licensed areas. Medicare Advantage membership increased primarily due to membership acquired through the acquisition of America’s 1st Choice and organic growth in existing markets. Medicaid membership increased primarily due to new business, partially offset by certain state market contractions and membership reverification processes. Other MembershipGrowth in our other membership can be impacted by changes in our medical membership, as our medical members often purchase our other products that are ancillary to our health business. We have experienced growth in our life and disability and vision memberships primarily due to higher sales in our Large Group business. Dental membership decreased primarily due to our reduced participation in ACA-compliant marketplaces, partially offset by higher sales in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses. Dental administration membership decreased primarily due to the loss of a large managed dental contract, partially offset by membership expansion under current contracts. December 31, 2017 Compared to December 31, 2016 Medical MembershipTotal medical membership increased primarily due to increases in our Local Group and Medicare membership, partially offset by decreases in our Individual, National Accounts, Medicaid, and BlueCard® membership. Self-funded medical membership increased primarily due to new sales and growth in our existing Large Group accounts, partially offset by lower activity from BlueCard® membership and the loss of a large multi-state employer group contract in our National Accounts. Fully-insured membership increased primarily due to higher sales during Medicare open enrollment, new sales in Large Group accounts and Medicare membership acquired through the acquisition of HealthSun. These increases in fully-insured membership were partially offset by attrition in both our non-ACA-compliant and ACA-compliant off-exchange Individual product offerings. Local Group membership increased primarily due to new sales and growth in our existing Large Group accounts. Individual membership decreased primarily due to attrition in both our non-ACA-compliant and ACA-compliant off-exchange product offerings, partially offset by growth in ACA-compliant on-exchange product offerings. National Accounts membership decreased primarily due to the loss of a large multi-state employer group, partially offset by new sales. BlueCard® membership decreased primarily due to lower membership activity at other BCBSA plans whose members reside in or travel to our licensed areas. Medicare membership increased primarily due to higher sales during open enrollment, membership acquired through the acquisition of HealthSun and growth in certain existing Medicare Advantage markets. Medicaid membership decreased primarily due to membership reverification processes and the impact of a new entrant in one of our existing markets, partially offset by new business expansions. Other MembershipLife and disability membership decreased primarily due to higher lapses in our fully-insured Local Group business. Dental membership increased primarily due to new sales and increased penetration in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses. Dental administration membership increased primarily due to membership expansion under current contracts. Vision membership increased primarily due to new sales and increased penetration in our National Accounts, Local Group and Medicare product offerings. Medicare Part D standalone membership decreased primarily due to our product repositioning strategies in certain markets.-50-Consolidated Results of OperationsOur consolidated summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are discussed in the following section.

Premiums for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $85,421, $83,648 and $78,860, respectively. Premiums are included in total operating revenue presented above.3bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%.4Selling, general and administrative expense ratio represents selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total operating revenue.Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Total operating revenue increased primarily from higher premiums, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees and other revenue. Higher premiums were primarily due to rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends and the HIP Fee reinstatement for 2018, as well as membership growth in our Medicare business as a result of our acquisitions of America’s 1st Choice and HealthSun and organic growth in existing markets. These increases in premiums were partially offset by a premium revenue decrease resulting from our reduced participation in ACA-compliant Individual markets in various states and a membership decline in our fully-insured Local Group business. The increase in administrative fees and other revenue primarily resulted from rate increases and membership growth in our self-funded Local Group and National Accounts businesses.-51-Net investment income increased primarily due to higher dividend yields on equity securities and higher income from alternative investments.We recognized net realized losses on financial instruments in 2018 compared to net realized gains on financial instruments in 2017. This change was primarily due to the recognition of changes in the fair values of equity securities from the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, or ASU 2016-01. For additional information related to the adoption of ASU 2016-01, see Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The change was further due to an increase in net realized losses on sales of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by increases in net realized gains on sales of equity securities and net realized gains on derivative financial instruments.Benefit expense decreased primarily due to our reduced participation in ACA-compliant Individual marketplaces in various states. The decrease was partially offset by increased expenses related to membership growth in our Medicare business primarily as a result of our America’s 1st Choice and HealthSun acquisitions and organic growth in existing markets. The decrease was further offset by higher medical costs in our Medicaid business.Our benefit expense ratio decreased primarily due to the increase in premiums to cover the HIP Fee reinstatement for 2018 and, to a lesser extent, improved medical cost performance in our Commercial & Specialty Business segment. The decrease was partially offset by higher medical costs in our Medicaid business.Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to the reinstatement of the HIP Fee for 2018. The increase was further attributable to an increase in spend to drive future growth. These increases were partially offset by the recognition of a guaranty fund assessment during 2017 related to the liquidation order of Penn Treaty Network American Insurance Company and its subsidiary American Network Insurance Company, or collectively Penn Treaty, and a decrease in performance-based incentive compensation. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio increased primarily due to the reinstatement of the HIP Fee for 2018. The increase in the ratio was further attributable to an increase in spend to drive future growth. These increases were partially offset by the growth in operating revenue, the impact of the Penn Treaty guaranty fund assessment in 2017 and a decrease in performance-based incentive compensation.Other expense decreased primarily due to lower debt extinguishment losses. For more information on our debt, see Note 12, “Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The decrease was partially offset by increased amortization of intangible assets acquired with the HealthSun and America’s 1st Choice acquisitions.Our income tax expense and effective tax rate increased primarily due to the non-recurring income tax benefit we recognized in 2017 related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the reinstatement of the non-tax deductible HIP Fee for 2018. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense due to the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.Our net income as a percentage of total revenue decreased as a result of all factors discussed above.Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Total operating revenue increased, resulting primarily from higher premiums, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees and other revenue. Higher premiums were due, in part, to rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends. The increase was further attributable to membership growth in our Medicare Advantage and Large Group product offerings. The increase in premiums was partially offset by the impact of the HIP Fee suspension for 2017, as we did not price affected products to cover any HIP Fee related expense in 2017. Additionally declines in both our non-ACA-compliant and ACA-compliant off-exchange Individual businesses, lower favorable adjustments to prior year estimates for the ACA risk adjustment premium stabilization program and declines in our National Accounts business partially offset the overall increase in premiums. The increase in administrative fees and other revenue primarily resulted from membership growth in our self-funded Large Group business.-52-Net investment income increased primarily due to higher income from alternative investments and higher investment yields on fixed maturity securities, partially offset by lower dividend yields on equity securities.Net realized gains on financial instruments increased primarily due to a decrease in net realized losses on derivative financial instruments and an increase in net realized gains on sales of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by a decrease in net realized gains on sales of equity securities.Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments decreased primarily due to a decrease in impairment losses on fixed maturity securities.Benefit expense increased primarily due to increased costs as a result of overall cost trends across our businesses. The increase was further attributable to membership growth in our Medicare Advantage and Large Group business product offerings. These increases were partially offset by the impact of membership declines in both our non-ACA-compliant and ACA-compliant off-exchange Individual product offerings.Our benefit expense ratio increased in 2017. The increase in the ratio was largely driven by the loss of revenue associated with the HIP Fee suspension for 2017, higher medical cost experience in our Medicare business and adjustments to prior year estimates for the ACA risk adjustment premium stabilization program. The increase in the ratio was partially offset by improved medical cost experience in our Individual business.Our selling, general and administrative expense increased due, in part, to an increase in spend to support our growth initiatives, the recognition of a guaranty fund assessment related to the liquidation order of Penn Treaty, an increase in performance-based incentive compensation and a legal settlement accrual related to settlement of the 2015 cyber attack class action litigation. For additional information regarding the cyber attack and related settlement, see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings - Cyber Attack Regulatory Proceedings and Litigation,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These increases were partially offset by lower ACA fees, primarily as a result of the suspension of the HIP Fee for 2017 and, to a lesser extent, the expiration of the fees for the ACA temporary reinsurance premium stabilization program that ended on December 31, 2016. The increases were further offset by lower selling, general and administrative costs related to expense efficiency initiatives and lower transaction costs related to the terminated Cigna Merger Agreement.Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased due, in part, to the lower ACA fees discussed above, lower selling, general and administrative costs related to expense efficiency initiatives and growth in operating revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in spend to support our growth initiatives, the impact of the Penn Treaty guaranty fund assessment, an increase in performance-based incentive compensation and the accrual related to the settlement of the 2015 cyber attack class action litigation.Other expense increased primarily due to losses on extinguishment of debt. For more information on our debt, see Note 12, “Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Income tax expense decreased primarily due to the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the suspension of the non-tax deductible HIP Fee for 2017 and the favorable impact of our recognition of tax benefits for prior acquisition costs incurred related to the terminated Cigna Merger Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a non-recurring income tax benefit related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized additional income tax expense related to the HIP Fee. The decrease in income tax expense was further due to the recognition of excess tax benefits during the year ended December 31, 2017 from the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, or ASU 2016-09. For additional information related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, see Note 2, “Basis of Presentation of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized additional California deferred state tax expense resulting from specific California legislation related to Managed Care Organizations that did not recur in 2017.Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the suspension of the HIP Fee in 2017, the deduction of the prior acquisition costs incurred related to the terminated Cigna Merger Agreement, the excess tax benefits from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the additional 2016 California deferred state tax expense, discussed above.-53-Our net income as a percentage of total revenue increased as a result of all factors discussed above. Reportable Segments Results of OperationsWe use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, which are Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, and Other. Operating gain, which is a non-GAAP measure, is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense and selling, general and administrative expense. It does not include net investment income, net realized (losses) gains on financial instruments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. The discussion of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional information, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, see Note 19, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, and Other segments’ summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows: Change Years Ended December 31 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 2018 2017 2 2016 2 $ % $ %Commercial & Specialty Business Operating revenue$35,782 $40,363 $38,347 $(4,581) (11.3)% $2,016 5.3 %Operating gain$3,629 $2,847 $3,148 $782 27.5 % $(301) (9.6)%Operating margin10.1% 7.1% 8.2% 300bp (110)bpGovernment Business Operating revenue$55,567 $48,702 $45,850 $6,865 14.1 % $2,852 6.2 %Operating gain$1,895 $1,445 $1,827 $450 31.1 % $(382) (20.9)%Operating margin3.4% 3.0% 4.0% 40bp (100)bpOther Operating revenue$(8) $(4) $(3) $(4) 100.0 % $(1) 33.3 %Operating loss1$(98) $(117) $(174) $19 (16.2)% $57 (32.8)% 1Primarily a result of changes in unallocated corporate expenses.2Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Commercial & Specialty BusinessOperating revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in our Individual business membership resulting from our reduced participation in ACA-compliant marketplaces in various states and, to a lesser extent, membership declines in our Local Group fully-insured products. The decrease was partially offset by premium rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends and the impact of the HIP Fee reinstatement for 2018. The decrease was further offset by an increase in administrative fees and other revenue due to rate increases and membership growth in our self-funded Large Group and National Accounts businesses.Operating gain increased due to improved medical cost performance, the impact of the recognition of the Penn Treaty guaranty fund assessment in 2017, and a decrease in certain selling, general and administrative expenses.-54-Government BusinessOperating revenue increased primarily due to membership growth in our Medicare business as a result of our acquisitions of America’s 1st Choice and HealthSun and organic growth in existing markets. The increase was further due to premium rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends and the HIP Fee reinstatement for 2018.Operating gain increased primarily due to the membership growth in our Medicare business described in the preceding paragraph. The increase was further due to retroactive premium adjustments recognized in various Medicaid markets and the impact of the HIP Fee reinstatement. These increases were partially offset by higher medical costs in our Medicaid business.Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Commercial & Specialty BusinessOperating revenue increased primarily due to premium rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends in our Individual and Local Group businesses. The increase was further attributable to membership growth in our fully-insured Large Group business and an increase in administrative fees and other revenue. The increase in administrative fees and other revenue was primarily due to membership growth in our self-insured Large Group business. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by the impact of the HIP Fee suspension for 2017, declines in membership in our non-ACA-compliant and ACA-compliant off-exchange Individual businesses, lower favorable adjustments to prior year estimates for the ACA risk adjustment premium stabilization program and declines in membership in our National Accounts business.Operating gain decreased primarily due to the recognition of the guaranty fund assessment related to the Penn Treaty liquidation, an increase in spend to support our growth initiatives and adjustments to prior year estimates for the ACA risk adjustment premium stabilization program. The decrease in operating gain was further due to an increase in performance-based incentive compensation and the settlement accrual for the class action litigation related to the 2015 cyber attack. The decrease in operating gain was partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative costs related to expense efficiency initiatives and fixed costs leverage from higher operating revenue. The decrease in operating gain was further offset by improved medical cost experience in our Individual businesses. Government BusinessOperating revenue increased primarily due to premium rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends in our Medicaid and Medicare business. The increase was further due to new Medicaid business expansions and membership growth in our Medicare Advantage business. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the HIP Fee suspension for 2017 and Medicaid membership declines resulting from membership reverification processes and the impact of a new entrant in an existing market.Operating gain decreased primarily due to the impact of the HIP Fee suspension for 2017 and higher medical cost experience in our Medicare business. The decrease was further due to an increase in performance-based incentive compensation and an increase in spend to support our growth initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative costs related to expense efficiency initiatives and fixed costs leverage from higher operating revenue. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider our most important accounting policies that require significant estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our other significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third-party -55-professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. Estimates can require a significant amount of judgment and a different set of assumptions could result in material changes to our reported results.Medical Claims Payable The most subjective accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2018, this liability was $7,454 and represented 17% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 98%, or $7,300, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2018; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 2%, or $154, of the total medical claims payable as of December 31, 2018. The level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period-end to the next, from approximately 1% to 5% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made.Liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in the aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be appropriate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that uses both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period-end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and healthcare trend levels, or “trend factors.” Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison to prior periods, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather, the availability of additional paid claims information drives changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense.We regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are materially different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of healthcare costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable.-56-While there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid claims liability as of December 31, 2018 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations.There is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through twelve months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. In our analysis for the claim liabilities at December 31, 2018, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 40 and 90 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower estimated variability ranging from 0 to 30 basis points.The difference in completion factor assumptions, assuming moderately adverse experience, results in variability of 3%, or approximately $213, in the December 31, 2018 incurred but not paid claims liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein.The other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2018 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. In our analysis for the period ended December 31, 2018, there was a 300 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors assuming moderately adverse experience. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 5%, or approximately $408, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factors used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claims liability at December 31, 2018. See Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year.” Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. The ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 90.2% for 2018, 89.4% for 2017 and 89.2% for 2016. This ratio serves as an indicator of claims processing speed whereby claims were processed slightly faster during 2018 than in both 2017 and 2016.We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2018, this metric was 13.7%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2017 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, this metric was 18.9%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2016 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, this metric was 14.2%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2015.We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation supports the reasonableness of our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims and the consistency in our methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2018, this metric was 1.3%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $930. This metric was 1.8% for 2017 and 1.4% for 2016. These metrics demonstrate a generally consistent level of reserve conservatism.-57-The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for each of 2017 and 2016 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims – current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims – prior years redundancies” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 2017 2016Total net incurred medical claims, as reported$69,244 $64,033Retrospective basis, as described above69,447 63,735Variance$(203) $298Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported(0.3)% 0.5%Given that our business is primarily short tailed (which means that medical claims are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider), the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2018 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2019.The 2017 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of (0.3)% was less than the 2016 percentage of 0.5%. The higher 2016 variance was driven by a similar level of prior year redundancies in 2017 associated with 2016 claim payments to the prior year redundancies in 2016 associated with 2015 claims payments. Prior year redundancies in 2018 associated with 2017 claim payments were lower by comparison to the previous year, thus creating a smaller 2017 variance.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes in accordance with FASB guidance, which requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance.At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following:•the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset;•the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim;•the tax rate at which the deferred tax assets will likely be utilized at in the future;•the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and•any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences.We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits, as required by the guidance. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted.-58-In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we intend to defend our positions vigorously through the federal, state and local appeals processes. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact on our results of operations or financial condition from these matters.For additional information, see Note 7, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsOur consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2018 was $20,504 and other intangible assets were $9,007. The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets represented 41.2% of our total consolidated assets and 103.4% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2018.We follow FASB guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, which include goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately.We complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. These tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Certain interim impairment tests are also performed when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount which is an indication that our goodwill may be impaired. These qualitative impairment tests include assessing events and factors that could affect the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our procedures include assessing our financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, various asset specific factors and entity specific events. If we determine that a reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired after utilizing these qualitative impairment analysis procedures, we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test.Our quantitative impairment test utilizes the projected income and market valuation approaches for goodwill and the projected income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. Use of the projected income and market valuation approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. The projected income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. These estimated future cash flows are then discounted. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted-average cost of capital. Market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including revenue, EBITDA, and book value of invested capital (debt and equity) and include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry.We did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2018 annual impairment tests, as the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying values as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, we do not believe that the estimated fair values of our reporting units are at risk of becoming impaired in the next twelve months. While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.-59-For additional information, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions” and Note 9, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. InvestmentsCurrent and long-term marketable investment securities were $18,705 at December 31, 2018 and represented 26.1% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2018. We classify fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” or “trading” and report those securities at fair value. Certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity.We review fixed maturity investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. FASB other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, guidance applies to fixed maturity securities and provides guidance on the recognition, presentation of, and disclosures for OTTIs. If a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and is presented within the other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in the income line item on our consolidated statements of income. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, the credit component of the OTTI is presented within the other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in the income line item on our consolidated statements of income and the non-credit component of the OTTI is recognized in other comprehensive income. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The credit component of an OTTI is determined primarily by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of acquisition. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral, including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default.We have a committee of accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. This could result in OTTI losses on investments being charged against future income. Given the uncertainty of future market conditions, as well as the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and material OTTI losses on investments may be recorded in future periods.In addition to marketable investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $3,726, or 5.2% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2018. These long-term investments consisted primarily of certain other equity investments, the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and real estate. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term.-60-Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits on investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future results of operations and financial condition. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $17,179 at December 31, 2018. The weighted-average credit rating of these securities was “A” as of December 31, 2018. Included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions of $947 that are guaranteed by third parties. With the exception of seven securities with a fair value of $16, these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of “A” as of December 31, 2018. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors, and we do not have any material exposure to any single guarantor, neither indirectly through the guarantees, nor directly through investment in the guarantor. Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of the fixed maturity securities without a guarantee, for which such information is available, was “A” as of December 31, 2018.Fair values of fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third-party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with FASB guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. We have controls in place to review the pricing services’ qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. In addition, we periodically review the pricing services’ pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable.We obtain quoted market prices for each security from the pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in these valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform analysis on the prices received from the pricing services to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes procedures such as a review of month-to-month price fluctuations and price comparisons to secondary pricing services. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from the pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.In certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. Such securities are designated Level III in accordance with FASB guidance. Securities designated Level III at December 31, 2018 totaled $623 and represented approximately 2.9% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level III securities primarily consisted of certain corporate securities and equity securities for which observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using internal estimates for inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields.For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” and Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” Note 4, “Investments,” and Note 6, “Fair Value,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Retirement Benefits Pension BenefitsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for some of our employees. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FASB guidance for retirement benefits, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by the guidance, we calculate the value of plan assets as described below. Further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods. An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our December 31, 2018 measurement date, we selected a weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.44%. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset -61-allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and an average of historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase.This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. We apply a corridor approach to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. Under this approach, only accumulated net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the average remaining service or lifetime of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date. At the December 31, 2017 measurement date, we changed the discount rate setting methodology from the single equivalent discount rate to the annual spot rate approach. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot rates from a full yield curve of published rates are used to discount each plan’s cash flows to determine the plan’s obligation. The spot rate approach produces a more precise measure of service and interest cost, and results in obligations that are equal at the measurement date under both methods. At the December 31, 2018 measurement date, the weighted-average discount rate under the annual spot rate approach was 4.15%, compared to 3.44% at the December 31, 2017 measurement date. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FASB guidance.In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities, equity securities and alternative investments across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow.Effective January 1, 2019, we curtailed the benefits under the Anthem Cash Balance Plan B pension plan. All grandfathered participants will no longer have pay credits added to their accounts, but will continue to earn interest on existing account balances. Participants will continue to earn years of pension service for vesting purposes.Other Postretirement BenefitsWe provide most associates with certain medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate and the expected trend in healthcare costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits.At our December 31, 2018 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 4.04%, compared to a discount rate of 3.42% at the December 31, 2017 measurement rate. We developed this rate using the annual spot rate approach as described above. The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of pre-Medicare (those who are not currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2018 measurement date was 7.50% for 2019 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2028. The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of post-Medicare (those who are currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2018 measurement date was 6.00% for 2019 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2028. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The healthcare cost trend rate assumption affects the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 by $24 and would increase service and interest costs by $1. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 by $21 and would decrease service and interest costs by $1. -62-For additional information regarding our retirement benefits, see Note 10, “Retirement Benefits,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.New Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended December 31, 2018 that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures, see the “Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance” and “Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted” sections of Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital Resources IntroductionOur cash receipts result primarily from premiums, administrative fees and other revenue, investment income, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity.We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy.A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations.The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. The securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility, although current market conditions are more stable. During recent years, the federal government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to improve liquidity in the financial markets and strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. In addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide liquidity and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions. We have a $2,500 commercial paper program. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we have the ability to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our $3,500 senior revolving credit facility to redeem any outstanding commercial paper upon maturity. Additionally, we believe the lenders participating in our credit facility would be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. In addition to the $3,500 senior revolving credit facility, we estimate that we expect to receive approximately $2,680 of dividends from our subsidiaries during 2019, which also provides further operating and financial flexibility. -63-A summary of our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: Years Ended December 31 $ Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016Sources of Cash Net cash provided by operating activities$3,827 $4,185 $3,270 $(358) $915Proceeds from sales, maturities, calls and redemptions of investments, net of purchases1,929 — — 1,929 —Issuance of common stock under Equity Units stock purchase contracts1,250 — — 1,250 —Issuances of commercial paper and short- and long-term debt, net of repayments— 3,653 — (3,653) 3,653Issuances of common stock under employee stock plans173 225 120 (52) 105Changes in bank overdrafts— 71 513 (71) (442)Other sources of cash, net174 712 276 (538) 436Total sources of cash7,353 8,846 4,179 (1,493) 4,667Uses of Cash: Purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales, maturities, calls and redemptions— (2,913) (114) 2,913 (2,799)Purchases of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired(1,760) (2,080) — 320 (2,080)Repurchase and retirement of common stock(1,685) (1,998) — 313 (1,998)Purchases of property and equipment(1,208) (800) (584) (408) (216)Repayments of commercial paper and short- and long-term debt, net of issuances(1,086) — (153) (1,086) 153Cash dividends(776) (705) (684) (71) (21)Changes in bank overdrafts(210) — — (210) —Other uses of cash, net(301) (820) (687) 519 (133)Total uses of cash(7,026) (9,316) (2,222) 2,290 (7,094)Effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(2) 4 5 (6) (1)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$325 $(466) $1,962 $791 $(2,428)Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increased spend to support growth initiatives and the impact of membership declines due to our reduced participation in ACA-compliant Individual marketplaces, and to a lesser extent, membership declines in our fully-insured Local Group business. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by cash receipts related to rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends. The decrease was further offset by lower income taxes paid in 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Other significant changes in sources and uses of cash year-over-year included an increase in net proceeds from sales of investments and the issuance of common stock under our Equity Units stock purchase contracts in 2018. These increases in cash were partially offset by an increase in net repayments of commercial paper and short- and long-term debt and increased purchases of property and equipment.Liquidity— Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016 The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in premium receipts as a result of both rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and growth in membership. The increase in cash flow was partially offset by an increase in claims payments due to higher medical cost experience and -64-growth in membership. The increase was further offset by an increase in spend to support our growth initiatives, the timing of provider capitation payments for pass-through funding under the California Medicaid contract and the timing of certain state Medicaid payments.Other significant changes in sources and uses of cash year-over-year included an increase in net purchases of investments, cash paid for acquisitions in 2017 and repurchases and retirement of common stock in 2017. These decreases in cash were partially offset by the cash received from the issuances of commercial paper and short- and long-term debt, net of repayments.Financial ConditionWe maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities of $22,639 at December 31, 2018. Since December 31, 2017, total cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities decreased by $2,540 primarily due to cash used for acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment, repurchases of our common stock, net repayments of commercial paper and short- and long-term debt and cash dividends paid to shareholders. These decreases were partially offset by cash generated from operations and the proceeds received from the issuance of our common stock under Equity Units stock purchase contracts.Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Certain accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities, or statutory accounting practices, differ from GAAP. Changes that occur in statutory accounting practices, if any, could impact our subsidiaries’ future dividend capacity. In addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries.At December 31, 2018, we held $1,949 of cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company, which are available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, potential future common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders, repurchases of debt securities and debt and interest payments. DebtPeriodically, we access capital markets and issue debt, or Notes, for long-term borrowing purposes, for example, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. Certain of these Notes may have a call feature that allows us to redeem the Notes at any time at our option and/or a put feature that allows a Note holder to redeem the Notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating. For more information on our debt, including redemptions and issuances, see Note 12, “Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We calculate our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, a non-GAAP measure, from the amounts presented on our audited consolidated balance sheets included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total debt plus total shareholders’ equity. Total debt is the sum of short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, and long-term debt, less current portion. We believe our debt-to-capital ratio assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. In addition, our bank covenants include a maximum debt-to-capital ratio that we cannot and did not exceed. Our debt-to-capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio was 40.2% and 42.9% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our senior debt is rated “A” by S&P Global, “BBB” by Fitch Ratings, Inc., “Baa2” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by limitations on future borrowings and a potential increase in our borrowing costs.-65-Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity We have a shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries and the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansions.We have a senior revolving credit facility, or the Facility, with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. The Facility provides credit up to $3,500 and matures on August 25, 2020. Our ability to borrow under the Facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. There were no amounts outstanding under the Facility at December 31, 2018.We have an authorized commercial paper program of up to $2,500, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2018, we had $697 outstanding under our commercial paper program.We are a member, through certain subsidiaries, of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, or collectively, the FHLBs. As a member we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. At December 31, 2018, we had $645 outstanding under our short-term FHLB borrowings.Through certain subsidiaries, we have entered into multiple 364-day lines of credit with separate lenders for general corporate purposes. These lines of credit provide combined credit up to $600. Our ability to borrow under the lines of credit is subject to compliance with certain covenants. At December 31, 2018 we had $500 outstanding under our 364-day lines of credit. As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we currently estimate that approximately $2,680 of dividends will be paid to the parent company during 2019. During 2018, we received $3,606 of dividends from our subsidiaries.We regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions, common stock and debt security repurchases and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. On January 29, 2019, our Audit Committee declared a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $0.80 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on March 29, 2019 to the shareholders of record as of March 18, 2019.Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2018, we had Board authorization of $5,493 to repurchase our common stock. For additional information regarding our sources and uses of capital, see Note 4, “Investments,” Note 5 “Derivative Financial Instruments,” Note 12 “Debt” and Note 14 “Capital Stock-Use of Capital-Dividends and Stock Repurchase Program” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.-66-Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsOur estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018 are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 YearsOn-Balance Sheet: Debt1 $29,640 $3,379 $3,568 $3,695 $18,998Other long-term liabilities2 1,374 30 574 472 298Off-Balance Sheet: Purchase obligations33,849 1,261 1,151 1,345 92Operating lease commitments1,117 192 304 236 385Investment commitments4873 263 281 35 294Total contractual obligations and commitments$36,853 $5,125 $5,878 $5,783 $20,067 1Includes estimated interest expense. 2Primarily consists of reserves for future policy benefits, projected other postretirement benefits, deferred compensation, supplemental executive retirement plan liabilities and certain other miscellaneous long-term obligations. Estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from this table as we had no funding requirements under ERISA at December 31, 2018 as a result of the value of the assets in the plans. 3Includes estimated payments for future services under contractual arrangements from third-party service contracts.4Includes unfunded capital commitments for alternative investments.The above table does not contain $278 of gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions and interest for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities. For further information, see Note 7, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our Facility and/or from public or private financing sources, will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet derivative instruments, guarantee transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements or any indemnification agreements that will require funding in future periods. We have not transferred assets to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not hold any variable interest in an unconsolidated entity where such entity provides us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support.Risk-Based CapitalOur regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies and HMOs largely based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, Risk-Based Capital (RBC) For Health Organizations Model Act, or RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under the RBC Model Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our regulated subsidiaries’ respective RBC levels as -67-of December 31, 2018, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, were in excess of all mandatory RBC requirements. In addition to exceeding the RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries.For additional information, see Note 21, “Statutory Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. (In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein)As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2018. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return.InvestmentsOur investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk.The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit event, such as a ratings downgrade or default, to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that event. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately “A.” Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which have exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value.Investments in fixed maturity securities include corporate securities which account for 46.2% of the total fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2018 and are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. We manage this risk through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of our corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately “BBB.”Market risk for fixed maturity securities is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $733 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $723 increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and the duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly.Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities, exchange-traded funds and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systemic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio.-68-As of December 31, 2018, 8.2% of our investments were equity securities. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $153. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $153.For additional information regarding our investments, see Note 4, “Investments,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Investments” within Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Long-Term DebtOur total long-term debt at December 31, 2018 consists of senior unsecured notes, convertible debentures, commercial paper and subordinated surplus notes by one of our insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2018, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $18,066 and $18,872, respectively. This debt is subject to interest rate risk as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. For additional information regarding our long-term debt, see Note 6, “Fair Value” and Note 12, “Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Derivatives We have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts, which are used to lock-in interest rates or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. We have used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities.Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these derivatives. As of December 31, 2018, we recorded a net liability of $4, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swaps’ fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $27 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $27 increase in fair value.For additional information regarding our derivatives, see Note 5, “Derivative Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. -69-",2023-12-30 18:53:31.251053

(In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein) This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. References to the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Anthem” or the “Company” used throughout this MD&A refer to Anthem, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and, unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries. References to the “states” include the District of Columbia, unless the context otherwise requires.This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. A detailed discussion of 2017 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. OverviewWe are one of the largest health benefits companies in the United States in terms of medical membership, serving approximately 41 medical members through our affiliated health plans as of December 31, 2019. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or BCBS, licensee for Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (in the New York City metropolitan area and upstate New York), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas, we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield or Empire Blue Cross. We also conduct business through arrangements with other BCBS licensees as well as other strategic partners. Through our subsidiaries, we also serve customers in numerous states across the country as Aim Specialty Health, Amerigroup, Aspire Health, CareMore, Freedom Health, HealthLink, HealthSun, Optimum HealthCare, Simply Healthcare, and/or UniCare. Also, in the second quarter of 2019, we began providing pharmacy benefits management, or PBM, services through our IngenioRx subsidiary. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia through our subsidiaries. We manage our operations through three reportable segments: Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business and Other. Prior to the second quarter of 2019, our Other segment included certain eliminations and corporate expenses not allocated to either of our other reportable segments. Beginning with the second quarter of 2019, our Other segment also includes IngenioRx, our pharmacy benefits manager, which began operations during the second quarter of 2019. In addition, during the second quarter of 2019, we reclassified our Diversified Business Group, or DBG, our integrated health services business, from our Government Business segment to the Other segment to reflect changes in how our segments are being managed. Amounts for prior years have been reclassified through this MD&A to conform to the current year presentation for comparability. Based on the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, guidance, as of December 31, 2019, IngenioRx and DBG did not collectively meet the quantitative thresholds for a reportable segment.Our operating revenue consists of premiums and administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue comes from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. Administrative fees and other revenue come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, or where the fee is based on either the processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized, revenues from our Medicare processing business and from other health-related businesses, including disease management programs and miscellaneous other income. Administrative fees and other revenue also include product revenue for PBM services performed by IngenioRx to unaffiliated PBM customers, including our self-funded groups that have contracted with IngenioRx for PBM services, and beginning in 2020, to third-party health plans.Our benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our fully-insured members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures -44-per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. While we offer a diversified mix of managed care products and services through our managed care plans, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products and services. Our managed care plans include: Preferred Provider Organizations; Health Maintenance Organizations, or HMOs; Point-of-Service plans; traditional indemnity plans and other hybrid plans, including Consumer-Driven Health Plans; and hospital only and limited benefit products. We classify certain claims-related costs as benefit expense to reflect costs incurred for our members’ traditional medical care, as well as those expenses which improve our members’ health and medical outcomes. These claims-related costs may be comprised of expenses incurred for: (i) medical management, including case and prospective utilization management; (ii) health and wellness, including disease management services for such conditions as diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, congestive heart failure and asthma management and wellness initiatives like weight-loss programs and smoking cessation treatments; and (iii) clinical health policy, such as identification and use of best clinical practices to avoid harm, identifying clinical errors and safety concerns, and identifying potential adverse drug interactions. These types of claims-related costs are designed to ultimately lower our members’ cost of care. Our cost of products sold represents the cost of prescription drugs dispensed by IngenioRx to unaffiliated PBM customers (net of rebates or discounts), including any co-payments made by or on behalf of the customer, per-claim administrative fees for prescription fulfillment and certain direct costs related to sales and administration of customer contracts.Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Commission expense generally varies with premium or membership volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels and thus, associated compensation expense. Other variable costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity.Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage healthcare costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management and health and wellness programs. Several economic factors related to healthcare costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating healthcare costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers and any regulatory or market-driven restrictions on our ability to obtain adequate premium rates to offset overall inflation in healthcare costs, including increases in unit costs and utilization resulting from the aging of the population and other demographics, as well as advances in medical technology, may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. For additional information about our business and reportable segments, see Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Note 19, “Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Business TrendsThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, as amended, or collectively, the ACA, has changed and may continue to make broad-based changes to the U.S. healthcare system. We expect the ACA will continue to impact our business model and strategy. Also, the legal challenges regarding the ACA, including a federal district court decision invalidating the ACA, or the “2018 ACA Decision”, which judgment has been stayed pending appeal, could significantly disrupt our business. During 2019, we modestly expanded our participation in the Individual ACA-compliant market. Our strategy has been, and will continue to be, to only participate in rating regions where we have an appropriate level of confidence that these markets are on a path toward sustainability, including, but not limited to, factors such as expected financial performance, regulatory environment, and underlying market characteristics. We -45-currently offer Individual ACA-compliant products in 91 of the 143 rating regions in which we operate. In addition, the continuing growth in our government-sponsored business exposes us to increased regulatory oversight. In the second quarter of 2019, we began using our new pharmacy benefits manager called IngenioRx to market and sell a PBM product to fully-insured and self-funded Anthem health plan customers throughout the country, as well as to customers outside of the health plans we own. This comprehensive product portfolio includes features such as drug formularies, a pharmacy network, prescription drug database, member services and mail order capabilities. In July 2019, we announced our first contract win with a third-party health insurer, Blue Cross of Idaho, and we began providing PBM services under that contract beginning on January 1, 2020. Also beginning in the second quarter of 2019, we began delegating certain PBM administrative functions, such as claims processing and prescription fulfillment, to CaremarkPCS Health, L.L.C., or CVS Health, which is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corporation, pursuant to a five-year agreement with CVS Health, or the CVS PBM Agreement. We intend to retain the responsibilities for IngenioRx’s clinical and formulary strategy and development, member and employer experiences, operations, sales, marketing, account management and retail network strategy. From December 2009 through December 2019, we delegated certain PBM functions and administrative services to Express Scripts, Inc., or Express Scripts, pursuant to our PBM agreement with Express Scripts, or the ESI PBM Agreement. In January 2019, we exercised our contractual right to terminate the ESI PBM Agreement earlier than the original expiration date of December 31, 2019 due to the acquisition of Express Scripts by Cigna Corporation, or Cigna. We began transitioning existing members from Express Scripts to IngenioRx in the second quarter of 2019, and completed the transition of all of our members on January 1, 2020. Prior to the termination of the ESI PBM Agreement, Express Scripts managed the network of pharmacy providers, operated mail order pharmacies and processed prescription drug claims on our behalf, while we sold and supported the product for our members, made formulary decisions, sold drug benefit design strategy and provided front line members support. We expect IngenioRx to provide our members with more cost-effective solutions and improve our ability to integrate pharmacy benefits within our medical and specialty platform.Pricing Trends: We strive to price our healthcare benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends. We frequently make adjustments to respond to legislative and regulatory changes as well as pricing and other actions taken by existing competitors and new market entrants. Product pricing in our Commercial & Specialty Business segment, including our Individual and Small Group lines of business, remains competitive. Revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government and/or applicable state governments. The ACA imposed an annual Health Insurance Provider Fee, or HIP Fee, on health insurers that write certain types of health insurance on U.S. risks. We price our affected products to cover the impact of the HIP Fee when applicable. The HIP Fee was suspended for 2019, has resumed for 2020 and has been permanently repealed beginning in 2021.Medical Cost Trends: Our medical cost trends are primarily driven by increases in the utilization of services across all provider types and the unit cost increases of these services. We work to mitigate these trends through various medical management programs such as utilization management, condition management, program integrity and specialty pharmacy management, as well as benefit design changes. There are many drivers of medical cost trends that can cause variance from our estimates, such as changes in the level and mix of services utilized, regulatory changes, aging of the population, health status and other demographic characteristics of our members, epidemics, advances in medical technology, new high cost prescription drugs, and healthcare provider or member fraud. Our underlying Local Group medical cost trends reflect the “allowed amount,” or contractual rate, paid to providers. We estimate that our aggregate cost of care trend for the full year of 2019 was approximately 6.0%, at the midpoint of our 5.5% to 6.5% estimated range for the year. We anticipate the Local Group medical cost trend in 2020 will be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%, including the benefit of lower pharmacy cost from the launch of IngenioRx and other medical cost management initiatives.For additional discussion regarding business trends, see Part I, Item 1 “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesThe ACA presented us with new growth opportunities, but also introduced new risks, regulatory challenges and uncertainties, and required changes in the way products are designed, underwritten, priced, distributed and administered. Changes to our business environment are likely to continue as elected officials at the national and state levels continue to enact, and both elected officials and candidates for election continue to propose, significant modifications to existing laws and regulations, including changes to taxes and fees. In addition, the legal challenges regarding the ACA, including the 2018 -46-ACA Decision, which judgment has been stayed pending appeal, continue to contribute to this uncertainty. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the ACA as any further developments or judicial rulings occur.The annual HIP Fee is allocated to health insurers based on the ratio of the amount of an insurer’s net premium revenues written during the preceding calendar year to the amount of health insurance premium for all U.S. health risk for those certain lines of business written during the preceding calendar year. We record our estimated liability for the HIP Fee in full at the beginning of the year with a corresponding deferred asset that is amortized on a straight-line basis to selling, general and administrative expense. The final calculation and payment of the annual HIP Fee is due by September 30th of each fee year. The HIP Fee is non-deductible for federal income tax purposes. Our affected products are priced to cover the increased selling, general and administrative and income tax expenses associated with the HIP Fee. The total amount due from allocations to health insurers was $14,300 for 2018, and we recognized $1,544 as selling, general and administrative expense related to the HIP Fee. There was no corresponding expense for 2019 due to the suspension of the HIP Fee for 2019. The HIP Fee has resumed and increased to $15,523 for 2020 and has been permanently eliminated beginning in 2021.As a result of the ACA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, issued Medical Loss Ratio, or MLR, regulations that require us to meet minimum MLR thresholds of 85% for Large Group and 80% for Small Group and Individual lines of business. Plans that do not meet the minimum thresholds have to pay a MLR rebate. For purposes of determining MLR rebates, HHS has defined the types of costs that should be included in the MLR rebate calculation. However, certain components of the MLR calculation as defined by HHS cannot be classified consistently under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. While considered benefit expense or a reduction of premium revenue by HHS, certain of these costs are classified as other types of expense, such as selling, general and administrative expense or income tax expense, in our GAAP basis financial statements. Accordingly, the benefit expense ratio determined using our consolidated GAAP operating results is not comparable to the MLR calculated under HHS regulations.The ACA also imposed a separate minimum MLR threshold of 85% for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, or Medicare Part D. Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D plans that do not meet this threshold have to pay an MLR rebate. If a plan’s MLR is below 85% for three consecutive years beginning with 2014, enrollment is restricted. A Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D plan contract will be terminated if the plan’s MLR is below 85% for five consecutive years.For additional discussion regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, and risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Regulation” and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors.”Other Significant Items or TransactionsIn January 2019, we exercised our contractual right to terminate the ESI PBM Agreement, and we completed the transition of our members from Express Scripts to IngenioRx on January 1, 2020. Notwithstanding our termination of the ESI PBM Agreement, the litigation between us and Express Scripts regarding the ESI PBM Agreement continues. In March 2016, we filed a lawsuit against Express Scripts seeking to recover damages for pharmacy pricing that is higher than competitive benchmark pricing and damages related to operational breaches. Express Scripts filed an answer to the lawsuit disputing our contractual claims and alleging various defenses and counterclaims. For additional information regarding this lawsuit, see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings - Express Scripts, Inc. Pharmacy Benefit Management Litigation,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In February 2018, we completed our acquisition of Freedom Health, Inc., Optimum HealthCare, Inc., America’s 1st Choice of South Carolina, Inc. and related entities, or collectively, America’s 1st Choice, a Medicare Advantage organization that offers HMO products, including Chronic Special Needs Plans and Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plans under its Freedom Health and Optimum HealthCare brands in Florida and its America’s 1st Choice of South Carolina brand in South Carolina. At the time of acquisition, through its Medicare Advantage Plans, America’s 1st Choice served approximately one hundred and thirty-five thousand members in 25 Florida and 3 South Carolina counties. This acquisition aligned with our plans for continued growth in the Medicare Advantage and Special Needs populations.In December 2017, we acquired HealthSun Health Plans, Inc., or HealthSun, which at the time of acquisition served approximately forty thousand members in the state of Florida through its Medicare Advantage plans, and which received a -47-five-star rating from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This acquisition aligned with our plans for continued growth in the Medicare Advantage and dual-eligible populations.For additional information related to the acquisitions of America’s 1st Choice and HealthSun, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In May 2017, we announced that we were terminating the Agreement and Plan of Merger, or Cigna Merger Agreement, between us and Cigna. Both we and Cigna have commenced litigation against the other seeking various actions and damages, including Cigna’s damage claim for a $1,850 termination fee pursuant to the terms of the Cigna Merger Agreement. For additional information about the ongoing litigation related to the Cigna Merger Agreement, see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings - Cigna Corporation Merger Litigation,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other significant transactions in recent years that have impacted or will impact our capital structure or that have influenced or will influence how we conduct our business operations include our Board of Directors’ declarations of dividends on our common stock, repurchases of our common stock, and debt repurchases and new debt issuances (2019 and prior). For additional information regarding these transactions, see Note 12, “Debt” and Note 14, “Capital Stock,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Selected Operating PerformanceDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, total medical membership increased by 1.1, or 2.7%, and this increase was driven primarily by growth in our fully-insured businesses. Operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $103,141, an increase of $11,800, or 12.9%, from the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in operating revenue was primarily from higher premiums, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees and other revenue. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $4,807, an increase of $1,057, or 28.2%, from the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net income was due to higher operating results in both our Commercial & Specialty Business and Government Business segments, in part due to the benefits realized from the launch of IngenioRx in 2019, net realized gains on financial instruments and lower income tax expense.Our fully-diluted earnings per share, or EPS, for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $18.47, an increase of $4.28, or 30.2%, from the year ended December 31, 2018. Our diluted shares for the year ended December 31, 2019 were 260.3, a decrease of 3.9, or 1.5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in EPS resulted primarily from the increase in net income in 2019.Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $6,061, or approximately 1.3 times net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3,827, or approximately 1.0 times net income. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to the impact of membership growth in our Government Business segment as well as higher net income in 2019. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the timing of working capital changes.Our results of operations discussed throughout this MD&A are determined in accordance with GAAP. We also calculate operating gain to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results. We define operating revenue as premium income and administrative fees and other revenue. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expense. We use these measures as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, forecasting future operating periods and setting incentive compensation targets. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income before income tax expense, net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional details on operating gain, see our “Reportable Segments Results of Operations” discussion included in this MD&A. For a reconciliation of reportable segment operating revenue to the amounts of total revenue included in the consolidated statements of income and a reconciliation of reportable segment operating gain to income before income tax expense, see Note 19, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.-48-We intend to expand through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and efficient use of capital in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale, as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. In 2019, we continued growing our government-sponsored business and modestly increased our participation in the Individual ACA-compliant market. In all other markets, we intend to maintain our position by delivering excellent service, offering competitively priced products, providing access to high-quality provider networks and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks.Membership Our medical membership includes seven different customer types: Local Group, Individual, National Accounts, BlueCard®, Medicare, Medicaid and our Federal Employees Health Benefits, or FEHB, Program. BCBS-branded business generally refers to members in our service areas licensed by the BCBSA. Non-BCBS-branded business refers to members in our non-BCBS-branded Amerigroup, Freedom Health, HealthSun, Optimum HealthCare and Simply Healthcare plans, as well as HealthLink and UniCare members. In addition to the above medical membership, we also serve customers who purchase one or more of our other products or services that are often ancillary to our health business.•Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. In addition, Local Group includes UniCare members. Local Group accounts are generally sold through brokers or consultants who work with industry specialists from our in-house sales force and are offered both on and off the public exchanges. Local Group insurance premiums may be based on claims incurred by the group or sold on a self-insured basis. The customer’s buying decision is typically based upon the size and breadth of our networks, customer service, the quality of our medical management services, the administrative cost included in our quoted price, our financial stability, our reputation and our ability to effectively service large complex accounts. Local Group accounted for 38.2%, 39.4% and 39.4% of our medical members at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.•Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. Individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, retail partnerships, our in-house sales force or via the exchanges. Individual business is sold on a fully-insured basis. We offer on-exchange products through public exchanges and off-exchange products. Federal premium subsidies are available only for certain public exchange Individual products. Unsubsidized Individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network and the efficiency of administration. Customer turnover is generally higher with Individual as compared to Local Group. Individual business accounted for 1.7%, 1.6% and 3.9% of our medical members at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.•National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in an Anthem service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker and consultant relationships. Service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. National Accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. We believe we have an advantage when competing for very large National Accounts due to the size and breadth of our networks and our ability to access the national provider networks of BCBS companies at their competitive local market rates. National Accounts represented 18.5%, 19.0% and 18.5% of our medical members at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.•BlueCard® host customers represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by Anthem who receive healthcare services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard® membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard® program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which an Anthem subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-Anthem controlled BCBSA licensee (i.e., the “home plan”). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard® members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard® members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the -49-average number of BlueCard® claims received per month. BlueCard® host membership accounted for 14.8%, 14.6% and 14.2% of our medical members at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.•Medicare customers are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Supplement plans; Medicare Advantage, including Special Needs Plans or SNPs, also known as Medicare Advantage SNPs; Medicare Part D; and dual-eligible programs through Medicare-Medicaid Plans, or MMPs. Medicare Supplement plans typically pay the difference between healthcare costs incurred by a beneficiary and amounts paid by Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans provide Medicare beneficiaries with a managed care alternative to traditional Medicare and often include a Medicare Part D benefit. In addition, our Medicare Advantage SNPs provide tailored benefits to special needs individuals who are institutionalized or have severe or disabling chronic conditions and to dual-eligible customers, who are low-income seniors and persons under age 65 with disabilities. Medicare Advantage SNPs are coordinated care plans specifically designed to provide targeted care, covering all the health care services considered medically necessary for members and often providing professional care coordination services, with personal guidance and programs that help members maintain their health. Medicare Advantage membership also includes Employer Group Medicare Advantage members who are related to National Accounts or retired members of Local Group accounts who have selected a Medicare Advantage product. Medicare Part D offers a prescription drug plan to Medicare and MMP beneficiaries. MMP, which was established as a result of the passage of the ACA, is a demonstration program focused on serving members who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. Medicare business accounted for 5.2%, 4.6% and 3.9% of our medical members at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.•Medicaid membership represents eligible members who receive healthcare benefits through publicly funded healthcare programs, including Medicaid, ACA-related Medicaid expansion programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, programs for seniors and people with disabilities, Children’s Health Insurance Programs, and specialty programs such as those focused on long-term services and support, HIV/AIDS, foster care, behavioral health and/or substance abuse disorders, and intellectual disabilities or developmental disabilities, among others. Total Medicaid program business accounted for 17.7%, 16.8% and 16.1% of our medical members at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.•FEHB members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. FEHB business accounted for 3.9% of our medical members at each of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two principal funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ healthcare costs. Some self-funded customers choose to purchase stop loss coverage to limit their retained risk.-50-The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Also included below is other membership by product. The medical membership and other membership presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

Fully-insured membership increased primarily due to growth in our Medicaid and Medicare businesses. Self-funded medical membership increased primarily due to higher activity from BlueCard® membership, partially offset by the decrease in our Large Group self-funded membership, which declined as a result of competitive pressures. Medicaid membership increased primarily due to expansions in new and existing markets, partially offset by the membership decrease resulting from the loss of a contract. Medicare membership increased primarily due to -51-higher sales during open enrollment exceeding lapses. BlueCard® membership increased due to higher activity by members of other BCBSA plans who reside in or travel to our licensed areas.Other MembershipGrowth in our other membership can be impacted by changes in our medical membership, as our medical members often purchase our other products that are ancillary to our health business. We have experienced growth in our life and disability and dental memberships primarily due to higher sales in our Large Group business. Vision membership increased primarily due to higher sales in our Medicare Advantage plans and Large Group business. Dental administration membership increased primarily due to growth in our FEHB program. -52-Consolidated Results of OperationsOur consolidated summarized results of operations and other information for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: Change Years Ended December 31 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017 2019 2018 2017 $ % $ %Total operating revenue$103,141 $91,341 $89,061 $11,800 12.9 % $2,280 2.6 %Net investment income1,005 970 867 35 3.6 % 103 11.9 %Net realized gains (losses) on financial instruments114 (180) 145 294 163.3 % (325) (224.1)%Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income(47) (26) (33) (21) (80.8)% 7 21.2 %Total revenues104,213 92,105 90,040 12,108 13.1 % 2,065 2.3 %Benefit expense81,786 71,895 72,236 9,891 13.8 % (341) (0.5)%Cost of products sold1,992 — — 1,992 NM — —Selling, general and administrative expense13,364 14,020 12,650 (656) (4.7)% 1,370 10.8 %Other expense1 1,086 1,122 1,190 (36) (3.2)% (68) (5.7)%Total expenses98,228 87,037 86,076 11,191 12.9 % 961 1.1 %Income before income tax expense 5,985 5,068 3,964 917 18.1 % 1,104 27.9 %Income tax expense1,178 1,318 121 (140) (10.6)% 1,197 989.3 %Net income$4,807 $3,750 $3,843 $1,057 28.2 % $(93) (2.4)% Average diluted shares outstanding260.3 264.2 267.8 (3.9) (1.5)% (3.6) (1.3)%Diluted net income per share$18.47 $14.19 $14.35 $4.28 30.2 % $(0.16) (1.1)%Effective tax rate19.7% 26.0% 3.1% (630)bp3 2,290bp3Benefit expense ratio286.8% 84.2% 86.4% 260bp3 (220)bp3Selling, general and administrative expense ratio4 13.0% 15.3% 14.2% (230)bp3 110bp3Income before income tax expense as a percentage of total revenues5.7% 5.5% 4.4% 20bp3 110bp3Net income as a percentage of total revenues4.6% 4.1% 4.3% 50bp3 (20)bp3 Certain of the following definitions are also applicable to all other results of operations tables in this discussion:NM Not meaningful.1Includes interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets and loss on extinguishment of debt.2Benefit expense ratio represents benefit expense as a percentage of premium revenue. Premiums for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $94,173, $85,421 and $83,648, respectively. Premiums are included in total operating revenue presented above.3bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%.4Selling, general and administrative expense ratio represents selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total operating revenue.Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018 The increase in total operating revenue was primarily from higher premiums, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees and other revenue. The higher premiums were largely due to Medicaid expansions in new and existing markets and membership growth in our Medicare business. The increase in premiums was further attributable to rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends. These increases in premiums were partially offset by the impact of the HIP Fee suspension for 2019. The increase in administrative fees and other revenue was primarily driven by IngenioRx, our PBM, which began its operations during the second quarter of 2019.-53-We recognized net realized gains on financial instruments in 2019 compared to net realized losses on financial instruments in 2018. This change was primarily due to a decrease in the net losses recognized for changes in the fair values of our equity securities.Benefit expense increased primarily due to membership growth across our reportable business segments and higher medical cost experience in our Medicaid business.Our benefit expense ratio increased largely due to the loss of revenue associated with the HIP Fee suspension for 2019, and, to a lesser extent, less favorable prior year reserve development in our Commercial & Specialty business segment during 2019 and margin normalization in our Individual business.Cost of products sold reflects the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed by IngenioRx for our self-funded customers. IngenioRx began operations during the second quarter of 2019, so there was no cost of products sold recognized in 2018. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased primarily due to the suspension of the HIP Fee for 2019. This decrease was partially offset by a net increase in spend to support growth in our businesses.Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased due to the growth in total operating revenue and the suspension of the HIP Fee for 2019.Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the suspension of the non-tax deductible HIP Fee for 2019. Our net income as a percentage of total revenue increased as a result of all factors discussed above.Reportable Segments Results of OperationsWe use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, which are Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, and Other. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expense. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains (losses) on financial instruments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. The discussion of segment results presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional information, see Note 19, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.-54-The following table presents a summary of our reportable segment financial information for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017: Change Years Ended December 31 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017 2019 2018 2017 $ % $ %Operating Revenue Commercial & Specialty Business$37,421 $35,782 $40,363 1,639 4.6 % (4,581) (11.3)%Government Business62,632 55,348 48,587 7,284 13.2 % 6,761 13.9 %Other7,695 1,519 127 6,176 406.6 % 1,392 NMEliminations(4,607) (1,308) (16) (3,299) NM (1,292) NMTotal operating revenue$103,141 $91,341 $89,061 $11,800 12.9 % $2,280 2.6 % Operating Gain (Loss) Commercial & Specialty Business$4,046 $3,600 $2,847 446 12.4 % 753 26.4 %Government Business2,054 1,928 1,442 126 6.5 % 486 33.7 %Other(101) (102) (114) 1 (1.0)% 12 (10.5)% Operating Margin Commercial & Specialty Business10.8% 10.1% 7.1% 70bp1 300bp1Government Business3.3% 3.5% 3.0% (20)bp1 50bp1 NM Not meaningful.1bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%.Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Commercial & Specialty BusinessOperating revenue increased primarily due to higher premium revenue and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue was higher as a result of rate increases in our Local Group business designed to cover overall cost trends and membership increases in our fully-insured businesses. These increases in premium revenue were partially offset by the impact of the HIP Fee suspension for 2019. The increase in administrative fees and other revenue was due to higher penetration of value-added services for self-funded members in our Large Group and National Accounts businesses.The increase in operating gain was primarily driven by the benefits realized in pharmacy cost as a result of the launch of IngenioRx in 2019 and greater penetration of value-added services and integrated health offerings. These increases were partially offset by less favorable prior year reserve development during 2019 and margin normalization in our Individual business.Government BusinessOperating revenue increased primarily due to higher premium revenue as a result of Medicaid expansions in new and existing markets, including specialized service populations, and membership growth in our Medicare business. The increase in premium revenue was further attributable to rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends in our Medicare and Medicaid businesses as well as increased reimbursed benefit utilization in our Federal Health Products & Services business. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the HIP Fee suspension for 2019.The increase in operating gain was primarily driven by the impact of premium increases due to rate adjustments and membership growth in our Medicaid business. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the HIP Fee suspension for 2019 and an increase in selling, general and administrative spend to support growth in our businesses.-55-OtherOperating revenue increased due to higher administrative fees and other revenue from IngenioRx and DBG. The increase was primarily driven by growth in our pharmacy services provided by IngenioRx, which commenced operations and began transitioning existing clients from Express Scripts to IngenioRx in the second quarter of 2019. Operating loss remained steady, as there were no substantial changes in unallocated corporate expenses. For our segment reporting, operating gains (losses) generated from IngenioRx and DBG affiliated activity have been included in our Commercial & Specialty Business and Government Business based upon their utilization of services from IngenioRx and DBG.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider our most important accounting policies that require significant estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our other significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third-party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. Estimates can require a significant amount of judgment and a different set of assumptions could result in material changes to our reported results.Medical Claims Payable The most subjective accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2019, this liability was $8,842 and represented 19% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 98%, or $8,633, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2019; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 2%, or $209, of the total medical claims payable as of December 31, 2019. The level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period-end to the next, from approximately 1% to 5% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made.Liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in the aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be appropriate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that uses both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period-end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and healthcare trend levels, or “trend factors.” -56-Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison to prior periods, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather, the availability of additional paid claims information drives changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense.We regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are materially different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of healthcare costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable.While there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid claims liability as of December 31, 2019 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations.There is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through twelve months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. In our analysis for the claim liabilities at December 31, 2019, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 40 and 90 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower estimated variability ranging from 0 to 30 basis points.The difference in completion factor assumptions, assuming moderately adverse experience, results in variability of 3%, or approximately $241, in the December 31, 2019 incurred but not paid claims liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein.The other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2019 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. In our analysis for the period ended December 31, 2019, there was a 320 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors assuming moderately adverse experience. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 5%, or approximately $468, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factors used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claims liability at December 31, 2019. See Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” accounts for those -57-adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year.” Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. The ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 89.3% for 2019, 90.2% for 2018 and 89.4% for 2017. This ratio serves as an indicator of claims processing speed whereby claims were processed slightly slower during 2019 than in 2018 and close to the same speed as in 2017.We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this metric was 7.4%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2018 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, this metric was 13.7%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2017 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, this metric was 18.9%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2016.We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation supports the reasonableness of our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims and the consistency in our methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this metric was 0.7%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $500. This metric was 1.3% for 2018 and 1.8% for 2017. These metrics demonstrate a generally consistent level of reserve conservatism.The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in Note 11, “Medical Claims Payable,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for each of 2018 and 2017 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims – current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims – prior years redundancies” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 2018 2017Total net incurred medical claims, as reported$68,651 $69,244Retrospective basis, as described above69,081 69,447Variance$(430) $(203)Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported(0.6)% (0.3)%Given that our business is primarily short tailed (which means that medical claims are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider), the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2019 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2020.The 2018 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of (0.6)% was higher than the 2017 percentage of (0.3)%. This was driven by the fact that the change in the prior year redundancy reported for 2019 as compared to 2018 was greater than the change in the prior year redundancy reported for 2018 as compared to 2017.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes in accordance with FASB guidance, which requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more -58-likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance.At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following:•the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset;•the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim;•the tax rate at which the deferred tax assets will likely be utilized in the future;•the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and•any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences.We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits, as required by the applicable guidance. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted.In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law, and we intend to defend our positions vigorously through the federal, state and local appeals processes. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact on our results of operations or financial condition from these matters.For additional information, see Note 7, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsOur consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2019 was $20,500 and other intangible assets were $8,674. The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets represented 37.7% of our total consolidated assets and 92.0% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2019.We follow FASB guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, which include goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately.We complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. These tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Certain interim impairment tests are also performed when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, which is an indication that our goodwill may be impaired. These qualitative impairment tests include assessing events and factors that could affect the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our procedures include assessing our financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, various asset specific -59-factors and entity specific events. If we determine that a reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired after utilizing these qualitative impairment analysis procedures, we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test.Our quantitative impairment test utilizes the projected income and market valuation approaches for goodwill and the projected income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. Use of the projected income and market valuation approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. The projected income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. These estimated future cash flows are then discounted. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted-average cost of capital. Market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including revenue; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; and book value of invested capital (debt and equity) and include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry.We did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2019 annual impairment tests, as it was determined that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying values as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, we do not believe that the estimated fair values of our reporting units are at risk of becoming impaired in the next twelve months. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.For additional information, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions” and Note 9, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. InvestmentsCurrent and long-term marketable investment securities were $21,220 at December 31, 2019 and represented 27.4% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2019. We classify fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” or “trading” and report those securities at fair value. Certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity.We review fixed maturity investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. FASB other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, guidance applies to fixed maturity securities and provides guidance on the recognition, presentation of, and disclosures for OTTIs. If a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and is presented within the other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, the credit component of the OTTI is presented within the other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income and the non-credit component of the OTTI is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The credit component of an OTTI is determined primarily by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of -60-acquisition. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral, including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default.We have a committee of accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. This could result in OTTI losses on investments being charged against future income. Given the uncertainty of future market conditions, as well as the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and material OTTI losses on investments may be recorded in future periods.In addition to marketable investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $4,228, or 5.5% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2019. These long-term investments consisted primarily of certain other equity investments, the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and real estate. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term.Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits on investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future results of operations and financial condition. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $20,181 at December 31, 2019. The weighted-average credit rating of these securities was “A” as of December 31, 2019. Included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions of $900 that are guaranteed by third parties. With the exception of four securities with a fair value of $12, these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of “A” as of December 31, 2019. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors, and we do not have any material exposure to any single guarantor, neither indirectly through the guarantees, nor directly through investment in the guarantor. Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of the fixed maturity securities without a guarantee, for which such information is available, was “A” as of December 31, 2019.Fair values of fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third-party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with FASB guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. We have controls in place to review the pricing services’ qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. In addition, we periodically review the pricing services’ pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable.We obtain quoted market prices for each security from the pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in these valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform analysis on the prices received from the pricing services to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes procedures such as a review of month-to-month price fluctuations and price comparisons to secondary pricing services. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from the pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.In certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. Such securities are designated Level III in accordance with FASB guidance. Securities designated Level III at December 31, 2019 totaled $397 and represented approximately 1.7% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level III securities primarily consisted of certain corporate securities and equity securities for which observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields.-61-For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” and Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” Note 4, “Investments,” and Note 6, “Fair Value,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Retirement Benefits Pension BenefitsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for some of our employees. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FASB guidance for retirement benefits, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by the guidance, we calculate the value of plan assets as described below. Further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods. An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our December 31, 2019 measurement date, we selected a weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.33%. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and an average of historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase.This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. We apply a corridor approach to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. Under this approach, only accumulated net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the average remaining service or lifetime of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date. We use the annual spot rate approach for setting our discount rate. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot rates from a full yield curve of published rates are used to discount each plan’s cash flows to determine the plan’s obligation. At the December 31, 2019 measurement date, the weighted-average discount rate under the annual spot rate approach was 3.11%, compared to 4.15% at the December 31, 2018 measurement date. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FASB guidance.In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of equity securities, investment grade fixed maturity securities and other types of investments across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow.Effective January 1, 2019, we curtailed the benefits under the Anthem Cash Balance Plan B pension plan. All grandfathered participants no longer have pay credits added to their accounts, but continue to earn interest on existing account balances. Participants continue to earn years of pension service for vesting purposes.Other Postretirement BenefitsWe provide most associates with certain medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate and the expected trend in healthcare costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits.-62-At our December 31, 2019 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 2.93%, compared to a discount rate of 4.04% at the December 31, 2018 measurement rate. We developed this rate using the annual spot rate approach as described above. The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of pre-Medicare (those who are not currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2019 measurement date was 7.00% for 2020 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2028. The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of post-Medicare (those who are currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2019 measurement date was 6.00% for 2020 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2028. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The healthcare cost trend rate assumption affects the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 by $23 and would increase service and interest costs by $1. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 by $20 and would decrease service and interest costs by $1. For additional information regarding our retirement benefits, see Note 10, “Retirement Benefits,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.New Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended December 31, 2019 that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures, see the “Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance” and “Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted” sections of Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital Resources IntroductionOur cash receipts result primarily from premiums, administrative fees and other revenue, investment income, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity.We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy.A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations.The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. The securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility, although current market conditions are more stable. During recent years, the federal government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to improve liquidity in the financial markets and strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. In addition, -63-governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide liquidity and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions. We have a $3,500 commercial paper program. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we have the ability to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our two senior revolving credit facilities, which provide for combined credit in the amount of $3,500, to redeem any outstanding commercial paper upon maturity. Additionally, we believe the lenders participating in our credit facilities would be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. In addition to the senior revolving credit facilities, we estimate that we expect to receive approximately $3,035 of dividends from our subsidiaries during 2020, which also provides further operating and financial flexibility.

These increases in operating cash flow were partially offset by the impact of the timing of working capital changes. Other significant changes in sources and uses of cash year-over-year included an increase in net purchases of investments in 2019 compared to net proceeds received from sales, maturities, calls and redemptions of investments in 2018, a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, an increase in net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and short- and long-term debt -64-in 2019 compared to net repayments in 2018 and cash received from the issuance of common stock under our Equity Units stock purchase contracts in 2018 that did not recur in 2019.Financial ConditionWe maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities of $26,157 at December 31, 2019. Since December 31, 2018, total cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $3,518, primarily due to cash generated from operations and issuances of commercial paper and short- and long-term debt, net of repayments. These increases were partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock, purchases of property and equipment and cash dividends paid to shareholders. Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Certain accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities, or statutory accounting practices, differ from GAAP. Changes that occur in statutory accounting practices, if any, could impact our subsidiaries’ future dividend capacity. In addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries.At December 31, 2019, we held $2,673 of cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company, which are available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, potential future common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders, repurchases of debt securities and debt and interest payments. DebtPeriodically, we access capital markets and issue debt, or Notes, for long-term borrowing purposes, for example, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. Certain of these Notes may have a call feature that allows us to redeem the Notes at any time at our option and/or a put feature that allows a Note holder to redeem the Notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating. For more information on our debt, including redemptions and issuances, see Note 12, “Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We calculate our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, a non-GAAP measure, from the amounts presented on our audited consolidated balance sheets included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total debt plus total shareholders’ equity. Total debt is the sum of short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, and long-term debt, less current portion. We believe our debt-to-capital ratio assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. In addition, our bank covenants include a maximum debt-to-capital ratio that we cannot and did not exceed. Our debt-to-capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio was 39.5% and 40.2% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our senior debt is rated “A” by S&P Global, “BBB” by Fitch Ratings, Inc., “Baa2” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by limitations on future borrowings and a potential increase in our borrowing costs.Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity We have a shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries and the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansions.We have a senior revolving credit facility, or the 5-Year Facility, with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. In June 2019, we amended and restated the credit agreement for the 5-Year Facility to, among other things, extend the -65-maturity date from August 2020 to June 2024 and decrease the amount of credit available from $3,500 to $2,500. In June 2019, we also entered into a 364-day senior revolving credit facility, or the 364-Day Facility, with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes, which provides for credit in the amount of $1,000 and matures in June 2020. Our ability to borrow under these credit facilities is subject to compliance with certain covenants. We do not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect our financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. There were no amounts outstanding under the 5-Year Facility or the 364-Day Facility at December 31, 2019.Through certain subsidiaries, we have entered into multiple 364-day lines of credit, or the Subsidiary Credit Facilities, with separate lenders for general corporate purposes. The Subsidiary Credit Facilities provide combined credit up to $600. Our ability to borrow under the Subsidiary Credit Facilities is subject to compliance with certain covenants. At December 31, 2019, we had $50 outstanding under the Subsidiary Credit Facilities. We have an authorized commercial paper program, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. In August 2019, we increased the amount available under the commercial paper program from $2,500 to $3,500. At December 31, 2019, we had $400 outstanding under our commercial paper program.We are a member, through certain subsidiaries, of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, or collectively, the FHLBs. As a member, we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. At December 31, 2019, we had $650 in outstanding short-term borrowings from FHLBs.As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we currently estimate that approximately $3,035 of dividends will be paid to the parent company during 2020. During 2019, we received $3,790 of dividends from our subsidiaries.We regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions, common stock and debt security repurchases and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. On January 28, 2020, our Audit Committee declared a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $0.95 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on March 27, 2020 to the shareholders of record as of March 16, 2020.Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2019, we had Board authorization of $3,792 to repurchase our common stock. For additional information regarding our sources and uses of capital, see Note 4, “Investments,” Note 5 “Derivative Financial Instruments,” Note 12 “Debt” and Note 14 “Capital Stock–Use of Capital–Dividends and Stock Repurchase Program” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.-66-Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsOur estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019 are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 YearsOn-Balance Sheet: Debt1 $31,249 $3,447 $3,653 $3,853 $20,296Operating leases, including imputed interest2795 172 285 203 135Investment commitments328 11 16 — 1Other long-term liabilities4 752 9 295 293 155Off-Balance Sheet: Purchase obligations53,531 1,236 630 1,076 589Operating leases, including imputed interest2394 13 60 66 255Investment commitments6971 287 378 106 200Total contractual obligations and commitments$37,720 $5,175 $5,317 $5,597 $21,631 1Includes estimated interest expense. 2See Note 17, “Leases,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.3Represents low income housing tax credits.4Primarily consists of reserves for future policy benefits, projected other postretirement benefits, deferred compensation, supplemental executive retirement plan liabilities and certain other miscellaneous long-term obligations. Estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from this table, as we had no funding requirements under ERISA at December 31, 2019 as a result of the value of the assets in the plans. 5Includes estimated payments for future services under contractual arrangements from third-party service contracts.6Includes unfunded capital commitments for alternative investments.The above table does not contain $172 of gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions and interest for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities. For further information, see Note 7, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our senior revolving credit facilities and/or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet derivative instruments, guarantee transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements or any indemnification agreements that will require funding in future periods. We have not transferred assets to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not hold any variable interest in an unconsolidated entity where such entity provides us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support.Risk-Based CapitalOur regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies and HMOs largely based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, -67-Risk-Based Capital (RBC) For Health Organizations Model Act, or RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under the RBC Model Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our regulated subsidiaries’ respective RBC levels as of December 31, 2019, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, were in excess of all applicable mandatory RBC requirements. In addition to exceeding these RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries.For additional information, see Note 21, “Statutory Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. (In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein)As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2019. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return.InvestmentsOur investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk.The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit event, such as a ratings downgrade or default, to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that event. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately “A.” Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which have exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value.Investments in fixed maturity securities include corporate securities, which account for 45.5% of our total fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2019 and are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase, prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. We manage this risk through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of our corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately “BBB.”Market risk for fixed maturity securities is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $860 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $871 increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and the duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly.-68-Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities, exchange-traded funds and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systemic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio.As of December 31, 2019, 4.9% of our investments were equity securities. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $104. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $104.For additional information regarding our investments, see Note 4, “Investments,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Investments” within Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Long-Term DebtOur total long-term debt at December 31, 2019 consists of senior unsecured notes, convertible debentures, commercial paper and subordinated surplus notes by one of our insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2019, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $19,385 and $21,774, respectively. This debt is subject to interest rate risk, as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. For additional information regarding our long-term debt, see Note 6, “Fair Value” and Note 12, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Derivatives We have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts, which are used to lock-in interest rates or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. We have used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities.Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these derivatives. As of December 31, 2019, we recorded a net asset of $21, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swaps’ fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $20 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $20 increase in fair value.For additional information regarding our derivatives, see Note 5, “Derivative Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. -69-",2023-12-30 18:53:12.126779

(In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein) This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”), should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. References to the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Anthem” or the “Company” used throughout this MD&A refer to Anthem, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and, unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries. References to the “states” include the District of Columbia, unless the context otherwise requires.This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. A detailed discussion of 2018 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. OverviewWe are one of the largest health benefits companies in the United States in terms of medical membership, serving approximately 43 medical members through our affiliated health plans as of December 31, 2020. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (“BCBSA”), an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield (“BCBS”) licensee for Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (in the New York City metropolitan area and upstate New York), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas, we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield or Empire Blue Cross. In addition, we conduct business through arrangements with other BCBS licensees as well as other strategic partners. Through our subsidiaries, we also serve customers in numerous states across the country as AIM Specialty Health, Amerigroup, Aspire Health, Beacon, CareMore, Freedom Health, HealthLink, HealthSun, Optimum HealthCare, Simply Healthcare, and/or UniCare. Also, in the second quarter of 2019, we began providing pharmacy benefits management (“PBM”) services through our IngenioRx subsidiary. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia through our subsidiaries. We manage our operations through four reportable segments: Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, IngenioRx and Other. In 2019, IngenioRx was included in our Other reportable segment. Amounts for 2019 have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation of our reportable segments for comparability.Our operating revenue consists of premiums, product revenue, and administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue is generated from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life insurance benefits. Product revenue represents services performed by IngenioRx for unaffiliated PBM customers and includes ingredient costs (net of any rebates or discounts), including co-payments made by or on behalf of the customer, and administrative fees. Unaffiliated PBM customers include our self-funded groups that contract with IngenioRx for PBM services and external customers outside of the health plans we own. Administrative fees and other revenue come from fees from our self-funded customers for the processing of transactions or network discount savings realized, revenues from our Medicare processing business and revenues from other health-related businesses, including disease management programs and miscellaneous other income. Our benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our fully-insured members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by -44-us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. While we offer a diversified mix of managed care products and services through our managed care plans, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products and services. Our managed care plans include: Preferred Provider Organizations; Health Maintenance Organizations (“HMOs”); Point-of-Service plans; traditional indemnity plans and other hybrid plans, including Consumer-Driven Health Plans; and hospital only and limited benefit products. We classify certain quality improvement costs as benefit expense. Quality improvement activities are those designed to improve member health outcomes, prevent hospital readmissions and improve patient safety. They also include expenses for wellness and health promotion provided to our members. These quality improvement costs may be comprised of expenses incurred for: (i) medical management, including care coordination and case management; (ii) health and wellness, including disease management services for such conditions as diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, congestive heart failure and asthma management and wellness initiatives like weight-loss programs and smoking cessation treatments; and (iii) clinical health policy, such as identification and use of best clinical practices to avoid harm, identifying clinical errors and safety concerns, and identifying potential adverse drug interactions. Our cost of products sold represents the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed by IngenioRx for our unaffiliated PBM customers (net of rebates or discounts), including any co-payments made by or on behalf of the customer, per-claim administrative fees for prescription fulfillment and certain direct costs related to sales and administration of customer contracts.Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Commission expense generally varies with premium or membership volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels and thus, associated compensation expense. Other variable costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity.Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage healthcare costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members, product pricing, medical management and health and wellness programs, innovative product design and our ability to maintain or achieve improvement in our CMS Star ratings. Several economic factors related to healthcare costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating healthcare costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers and any regulatory or market-driven restrictions on our ability to obtain adequate premium rates to offset overall inflation in healthcare costs, including increases in unit costs and utilization resulting from the aging of the population and other demographics, the impact of epidemics and pandemics, as well as advances in medical technology, may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. For additional information about our business and reportable segments, see Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Note 20, “Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.COVID-19 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a global health pandemic. At the onset of the pandemic, to prevent its spread, most states issued shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, which generally required the businesses not considered essential to close their physical offices. While these orders were largely lifted during the second quarter of 2020, many states and local authorities continued to impose certain restrictions on the conduct of businesses and individuals. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and the virus and mitigation efforts have continued to impact the global economy, cause market instability, increase unemployment and put pressure on the healthcare system. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and will continue to impact our membership and benefit expense and has influenced and will likely continue to influence member behavior, impacting how members access healthcare services. Although increased unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decline in our Local Group membership, our Medicaid -45-membership grew as a result of the temporary suspension of eligibility recertification efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While reduced or cancelled utilization of non-COVID-19 health services by our members decreased our claim costs overall in 2020, in the second half of 2020 utilization of such services began to rebound, and non-COVID-19 claim costs began to normalize as the shelter-in-place, stay-at-home orders and other restrictions on the conduct of businesses were lifted. Our expenses in 2020 included additional costs to cover COVID-19 related testing, treatment, expanded coverage of insurance benefits, waivers for cost-sharing and actions to support our providers. Furthermore, our expenses associated with COVID-19, including testing and treatment and the actions taken to support our members in response to the pandemic, accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2020 and exceeded the benefit we experienced during the quarter from the lower volume of healthcare claims attributable to decreased utilization of non-COVID-19 health services.We remain focused on increasing access and coverage for our members and made several changes to our membership benefits and business operations, adopted tools and policies to assist consumers and care providers and provided support to our associates and our local communities, which were discussed in Part I, Item 1, “Business — COVID-19,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further, during 2020 we proactively took several actions to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility and minimize the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including:•Borrowing under our senior revolving credit facility in March 2020, which was repaid in April 2020;•Delaying certain tax payments as permitted by the IRS and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”); and•Temporarily suspending our share repurchase activity in March 2020, which was resumed in late June 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has created unique and unprecedented challenges, and although it has impacted and will likely continue to impact our membership and benefit expense, it did not have a material adverse effect on our reported results in 2020. However, this may change in the future as the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving, and the extent of its impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic as well as resulting legislative and regulatory changes that may impact our business. For additional discussion regarding our risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and our other risk factors, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “Business Trends” in this MD&A.Business TrendsThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, as amended (collectively, the “ACA”), has changed and may continue to make broad-based changes to the U.S. healthcare system. We expect the ACA will continue to impact our business model and strategy. Also, the legal challenges regarding the ACA, including a federal district court decision invalidating the ACA, which was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in November 2020 and has been stayed pending the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision, could significantly disrupt our business. We currently offer Individual ACA-compliant products in 103 of the 143 rating regions in which we operate. Our strategy has been, and will continue to be, to only participate in rating regions where we have an appropriate level of confidence that these markets are on a path toward sustainability, including, but not limited to, factors such as expected financial performance, regulatory environment, and underlying market characteristics. In addition, the continuing growth in our government-sponsored business exposes us to increased regulatory oversight. In the second quarter of 2019, we began using IngenioRx to market and offer PBM services to our affiliated health plan customers throughout the country, as well as to customers outside of the health plans we own. Our comprehensive PBM services portfolio includes features such as formulary management, pharmacy networks, a prescription drug database, member services and mail order capabilities. IngenioRx delegates certain PBM administrative functions, such as claims processing and prescription fulfillment, to CaremarkPCS Health, L.L.C., which is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corporation, pursuant to a five-year agreement. With IngenioRx, we retain the responsibilities for clinical and formulary strategy and development, member and employer experiences, operations, sales, marketing, account management and retail network strategy. From December 2009 through December 2019, we delegated certain PBM functions and administrative services to Express Scripts, Inc. (“Express Scripts”). We began transitioning existing members from Express Scripts to IngenioRx in the second quarter of 2019, and completed the transition of all of our members by January 1, 2020.Pricing Trends: We strive to price our healthcare benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical cost trends. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and the impacts it may have on our pricing, such as surges -46-in COVID-19 hospitalizations, infection rates, and the cost of COVID-19 vaccines. We frequently make adjustments to respond to legislative and regulatory changes as well as pricing and other actions taken by existing competitors and new market entrants. Product pricing in our Commercial & Specialty Business segment, including our Individual and Small Group lines of business, remains competitive. Revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government and/or applicable state governments. The ACA imposed an annual Health Insurance Provider Fee (“HIP Fee”) on health insurers that write certain types of health insurance on U.S. risks. We priced our affected products to cover the impact of the HIP Fee when it was in effect. The HIP Fee was suspended for 2019, was resumed for 2020 and has been permanently repealed beginning in 2021.Medical Cost Trends: Our medical cost trends are primarily driven by increases in the utilization of services across all provider types and the unit cost increases of these services. We work to mitigate these trends through various medical management programs such as utilization management, condition management, program integrity and specialty pharmacy management, as well as benefit design changes. There are many drivers of medical cost trends that can cause variance from our estimates, such as changes in the level and mix of services utilized, regulatory changes, aging of the population, health status and other demographic characteristics of our members, epidemics, pandemics, advances in medical technology, new high cost prescription drugs, and healthcare provider or member fraud. Our underlying Local Group medical cost trends reflect the “allowed amount,” or contractual rate, paid to providers. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a decrease in utilization of non-COVID-19 health services, which decreased our claim costs in 2020. While the utilization of such services began to rebound and claim costs began to normalize in the second half of 2020, further increases in the utilization of such services may increase our claim costs in the future and affect our medical cost trends. Our expenses in 2020 include additional costs to cover COVID-19 related testing, treatment, expanded benefits coverage and waivers for cost-sharing. In response to the current crisis, we expanded coverage for certain members in our affiliated health plans for testing and treatment related to a COVID-19 diagnosis. Governmental action has required us to provide full coverage for COVID-19 testing to our members, and future governmental action could require us to provide additional coverage, including, for example, vaccines. Increased member demand for care, along with continued COVID-19 care, testing and vaccination costs, are expected to result in increased future medical costs. The continued cost and volume of covered services related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our future claim costs. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations and medical cost trends.For additional discussion regarding business trends, see Part I, Item 1, “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesFederal and state legislation has been enacted, and is likely to continue to be enacted, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that has had, and we expect will continue to have, a significant impact on all of our lines of business, including mandates to waive cost-sharing on COVID-19 testing, treatment and related services. The federal government enacted the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the CARES Act in March 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act in April 2020 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 in December 2020 (the “Appropriations Act”). These acts provide, among other things, prohibitions on prior authorization and cost-sharing for certain items and services related to COVID-19 tests, reforms including waiving Medicare originating site restrictions for qualified providers providing telehealth services, financial support to healthcare providers, including expansion of the Medicare accelerated payment program to all providers receiving Medicare payments, and funding to replenish and administer small business loan programs to help small businesses keep their workers employed and healthcare benefits covered in the group market.The Appropriations Act contains a number of provisions that may have a material effect upon our business, including procedures and coverage requirements related to surprise medical bills and new mandates for continuity of care for certain patients, price comparison tools, disclosure of broker compensation and reporting on pharmacy benefits and drug costs. The various health plan-related requirements of the Appropriations Act will go into effect on January 1, 2022, and our first report on pharmacy benefits and drug costs is due December 27, 2021.Regulatory changes have also been enacted, and are likely to continue to be enacted, at the state and federal level in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those changes, which could have a significant impact on health benefits, consumer -47-eligibility for public programs, and our cash flows, include mandated expansion of premium payment terms including the time period for which claims can be denied for lack of payment, mandates related to prior authorizations and payment levels to providers, additional consumer enrollment windows, and an increased ability to provide services through telehealth. We are providing extensions to premium payment terms in certain situations and working closely with state regulators that are mandating or requesting such relief.The ACA presented us with new growth opportunities, but also introduced new risks, regulatory challenges and uncertainties, and required changes in the way products are designed, underwritten, priced, distributed and administered. Changes to our business environment are likely to continue as elected officials at the national and state levels continue to enact, and both elected officials and candidates for election continue to propose, significant modifications to existing laws and regulations, including changes to taxes and fees. In addition, the legal challenges regarding the ACA, including a federal district court decision invalidating the ACA in its entirety, which was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in November 2020 and has been stayed pending the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision, continue to contribute to this uncertainty. In a separate development, in April 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the federal government is required to pay health insurance companies for amounts owed, as calculated under the risk corridor program of the ACA. In June 2020, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims entered a final judgment stipulating that we are entitled to reimbursement for risk corridor amounts from 2014, 2015 and 2016. At the end of December 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) issued final guidance on how to treat the risk corridor recoveries that we expect to receive. Based on the guidance from HHS, we revised previously filed minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”) reports and recognized the net premium impact of the risk corridor recoveries in the fourth quarter of 2020. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the ACA as any further developments or judicial rulings occur.The annual HIP Fee, which has been permanently eliminated beginning in 2021, was allocated to health insurers based on the ratio of the amount of an insurer’s net premium revenues written during the preceding calendar year to the amount of health insurance premium for all U.S. health risk for those certain lines of business written during the preceding calendar year. The HIP Fee was non-deductible for federal income tax purposes. Our affected products were priced to cover the increased selling, general and administrative and income tax expenses associated with the HIP Fee when applicable. The HIP Fee was suspended for 2019. For 2020, the HIP Fee resumed and the total amount due from allocations to health insurers was $15,523. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $1,570 as selling, general and administrative expense related to the HIP Fee. There was no corresponding expense for 2019 due to the suspension of the HIP Fee for 2019. The HIP Fee has been permanently eliminated beginning in 2021.As a result of the ACA, the HHS issued MLR regulations that require us to meet minimum MLR thresholds of 85% for Large Group and 80% for Small Group and Individual lines of business. Plans that do not meet the minimum thresholds have to pay a MLR rebate. For purposes of determining MLR rebates, HHS has defined the types of costs that should be included in the MLR rebate calculation. However, certain components of the MLR calculation as defined by HHS cannot be classified consistently under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). While considered benefit expense or a reduction of premium revenue by HHS, certain of these costs are classified as other types of expense, such as selling, general and administrative expense or income tax expense, in our GAAP basis financial statements. Accordingly, the benefit expense ratio determined using our consolidated GAAP operating results is not comparable to the MLR calculated under HHS regulations.The ACA also imposed a separate minimum MLR threshold of 85% for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans (“Medicare Part D”). Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D plans that do not meet this threshold have to pay an MLR rebate. If a plan’s MLR is below 85% for three consecutive years, enrollment is restricted. A Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D plan contract will be terminated if the plan’s MLR is below 85% for five consecutive years.For additional discussion regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, and risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, see Part I, Item 1, “Business — Regulation” and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”-48-Other Significant ItemsBusiness and Operational MattersOn February 2, 2021, we announced our entrance into an agreement with InnovaCare Health, L.P. to acquire its Puerto Rico-based subsidiaries, including MMM Holdings, LLC (“MMM”) and its Medicare Advantage plan MMM Healthcare, LLC, Medicaid plan and other affiliated companies. MMM is an integrated healthcare organization and seeks to provide its Medicare Advantage and Medicaid members with a whole health experience through its network of specialized clinics and wholly owned independent physician associations. This acquisition aligns with our vision to be an innovative, valuable and inclusive healthcare partner by providing care management programs that improve the lives of the people we serve. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2021 and is subject to standard closing conditions and customary approvals.In 2020, we introduced enterprise-wide initiatives to optimize our business and as a result, recorded a charge of $653 in selling, general and administrative expenses. We believe these initiatives largely represent the next step forward in our progression towards becoming a more agile organization, including process automation and a reduction in our office space footprint. For additional information, see Note 4, “Business Optimization Initiatives” and Note 18, “Leases,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.On February 28, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Beacon Health Options, Inc. (“Beacon”), the largest independently held behavioral health organization in the country. At the time of acquisition, Beacon served more than thirty-four million individuals across all fifty states. This acquisition aligned with our strategy to diversify into health services and deliver both integrated solutions and care delivery models that personalize care for people with complex and chronic conditions. For additional information, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In February 2018, we completed our acquisition of Freedom Health, Inc., Optimum HealthCare, Inc., America’s 1st Choice of South Carolina, Inc. and related entities. This Medicare Advantage organization offers HMO products, including Chronic Special Needs Plans and Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plans, under its Freedom Health and Optimum HealthCare brands in Florida and its America’s 1st Choice of South Carolina brand in South Carolina. This acquisition aligned with our plans for continued growth in the Medicare Advantage and Special Needs populations.Other significant transactions in recent years that have impacted or will impact our capital structure or that have influenced or will influence how we conduct our business operations include our Board of Directors’ declarations of dividends on our common stock, repurchases of our common stock, debt repurchases and new debt issuances (2020 and prior). For additional information regarding these transactions, see Note 13, “Debt” and Note 15, “Capital Stock,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Litigation MattersIn the consolidated multi-district proceeding in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama (the “Court”) captioned In re Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation (“BCBSA Litigation”), the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (the “BCBSA”), and Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensees, including us (the “Blue plans”) have approved a settlement agreement and release (the “Subscriber Settlement Agreement”) with the plaintiffs representing a putative nationwide class of health plan subscribers. Generally, the lawsuits in the BCBSA Litigation challenge elements of the licensing agreements between the BCBSA and the independently owned and operated Blue plans. The cases were brought by two putative nationwide classes of plaintiffs, health plan subscribers and providers, and the Subscriber Settlement Agreement applies only to the putative subscriber class. No settlement agreement has been reached with the provider plaintiffs at this time, and the defendants continue to contest the consolidated cases brought by the provider plaintiffs. If approved by the Court, the Subscriber Settlement Agreement will require the defendants to make a monetary settlement payment, our portion of which is estimated to be $594, and will contain certain non-monetary terms including (i) eliminating the “national best efforts” rule in the BCBSA license agreements (which rule limits the percentage of non-Blue revenue permitted for each Blue plan) and (ii) allowing for some large national employers with self-funded benefit plans to request a bid for insurance coverage from a second Blue plan in addition to the local Blue plan. We recognized our estimated payment obligation of $548, net of third-party insurance coverage received as of December 31, 2020.-49-On November 30, 2020, the Court issued an order preliminarily approving the Subscriber Settlement Agreement, following which members of the Subscriber class were provided notice of the Settlement Agreement and an opportunity to opt out of the class. All terms of the Subscriber Settlement Agreement are subject to final approval by the Court before they become effective. Objections to the settlement as well as the deadline for those that wish to opt-out from the settlement must be submitted by July 28, 2021. Claims must be filed by November 5, 2021. A final approval hearing has been scheduled for October 20, 2021. If the Court grants approval of the Subscriber Settlement Agreement, and after all appellate rights have expired or have been exhausted in a manner that affirms the Court’s final order and judgment, the defendants’ payment and non-monetary obligations under the Subscriber Settlement Agreement will become effective. For additional information regarding this lawsuit, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings – Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In August 2020, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that neither we nor Cigna Corporation could collect damages in connection with the now terminated Agreement and Plan of Merger, between us and Cigna Corporation. Cigna filed a notice of appeal in November 2020 challenging the trial court’s opinion that Anthem did not owe Cigna a termination fee. Cigna filed its appellate brief in December 2020, and we filed a response in January 2021. For additional information, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings - Cigna Corporation Merger Litigation,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In January 2019, we exercised our contractual right to terminate our PBM Agreement with Express Scripts (the “ESI PBM Agreement”) and we completed the transition of our members from Express Scripts to IngenioRx by January 1, 2020. Notwithstanding our termination of the ESI PBM Agreement, the litigation between us and Express Scripts regarding the ESI PBM Agreement continues. For additional information regarding this lawsuit, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings - Express Scripts, Inc. Pharmacy Benefit Management Litigation,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Selected Operating PerformanceDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, total medical membership increased by 1.9, or 4.7%. Our medical membership grew in both our Government Business and Commercial & Specialty Business segments. The increase in medical membership in our Government Business segment was driven by organic growth in our Medicaid business due to the temporary suspension of eligibility recertification efforts in our markets in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as acquisitions, and growth in our Medicare business. The increase in medical membership in our Commercial & Specialty Business segment was primarily driven by growth in our self-funded business, partially offset by declines in our fully-insured Local Group membership due to negative in-group changes as a result of increased unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.Operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $120,808, an increase of $17,667, or 17.1%, from the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in operating revenue was primarily driven by higher premium revenue in our Government Business segment, as well as increased pharmacy product revenue related to the launch of IngenioRx.Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4,572, a decrease of $235, or 4.9%, from the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net income was a result of lower operating results in our Commercial & Specialty Business segment, which was largely driven by costs associated with actions taken to support our members and providers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and costs for COVID-19 related care, as well as our estimated payment obligation related to the BCBSA Litigation and expenses related to our business optimization initiatives recognized in 2020, higher income tax expense, and a decrease in net earnings from investment activities. These decreases in net income were largely offset by higher operating results in our IngenioRx and Government Business segments.Our fully-diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $17.98, a decrease of $0.49, or 2.7%, from the year ended December 31, 2019. Our diluted shares for the year ended December 31, 2020 were 254.3, a decrease of 6.0, or 2.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in EPS resulted from the decrease in net income, partially offset by the impact of a lower number of shares outstanding in 2020.-50-Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $10,688, or approximately 2.3 times net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $6,061, or approximately 1.3 times net income. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to the impact of the timing of working capital changes. The increase was further due to membership growth in our Government Business segment and higher net income in 2020, excluding the non-cash impact of accrued expenses related to our business optimization initiatives and the BCBSA Litigation.Our results of operations discussed throughout this MD&A are determined in accordance with GAAP. We also calculate operating gain to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results. We define operating revenue as premium income, product revenue and administrative fees and other revenue. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expense. We use these measures as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, forecasting future operating periods and setting incentive compensation targets. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income before income tax expense, net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional details on operating gain, see our “Reportable Segments Results of Operations” discussion included in this MD&A. For a reconciliation of reportable segment operating revenue to the amounts of total revenue included in the consolidated statements of income and a reconciliation of reportable segment operating gain to income before income tax expense, see Note 20, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We intend to expand through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and efficient use of capital in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale, as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. In 2019, we began using IngenioRx to market and offer PBM services, and we expect IngenioRx to improve our ability to integrate pharmacy benefits within our medical and specialty platform. In 2020, we continued growing our government-sponsored business. In all other markets, we intend to maintain our position by delivering excellent service, offering competitively priced products, providing access to high-quality provider networks and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks.Membership Our medical membership includes seven different customer types: Local Group, Individual, National Accounts, BlueCard®, Medicare, Medicaid and our Federal Employees Health Benefits (“FEHB”) Program. BCBS-branded business generally refers to members in our service areas licensed by the BCBSA. Non-BCBS-branded business refers to members in our non-BCBS-branded Amerigroup, Freedom Health, HealthSun, Optimum HealthCare and Simply Healthcare plans, as well as Beacon, HealthLink and UniCare members. In addition to the above medical membership, we also serve customers who purchase one or more of our other products or services that are often ancillary to our health business.•Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. In addition, Local Group includes Student Health and UniCare members. Local Group accounts are generally sold through brokers or consultants who work with industry specialists from our in-house sales force and are offered both on and off the public exchanges. Local Group insurance premiums may be based on claims incurred by the group or sold on a self-insured basis. The customer’s buying decision is typically based upon the size and breadth of our networks, customer service, the quality of our medical management services, the administrative cost included in our quoted price, our financial stability, our reputation and our ability to effectively service large complex accounts. Local Group accounted for 36.4%, 38.2% and 39.4% of our medical members at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.•Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. Individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, retail partnerships, our in-house sales force or via the exchanges. Individual business is sold on a fully-insured basis. We offer on-exchange products through public exchanges and off-exchange products. Federal premium subsidies are available only for certain public exchange Individual products. Unsubsidized Individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network and the efficiency of administration. Customer turnover is generally -51-higher with Individual as compared to Local Group. Individual business accounted for 1.6%, 1.7% and 1.6% of our medical members at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.•National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in an Anthem service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker and consultant relationships. Service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. National Accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. We believe we have an advantage when competing for very large National Accounts due to the size and breadth of our networks and our ability to access the national provider networks of other BCBS companies at their competitive local market rates. National Accounts represented 18.0%, 18.5% and 19.0% of our medical members at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.•BlueCard® host customers represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by Anthem who receive healthcare services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard® membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard® program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which an Anthem subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-Anthem controlled BCBSA licensee (the “home plan”). We perform certain functions including claims pricing and administration for BlueCard® members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard® members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard® claims received per month. BlueCard® host membership accounted for 14.1%, 14.8% and 14.6% of our medical members at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.•Medicare customers are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Supplement plans; Medicare Advantage, including Special Needs Plans (“SNPs”), also known as Medicare Advantage SNPs; Medicare Part D; and dual-eligible programs through Medicare-Medicaid Plans (“MMPs”). Medicare Supplement plans typically pay the difference between healthcare costs incurred by a beneficiary and amounts paid by Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans provide Medicare beneficiaries with a managed care alternative to traditional Medicare and often include a Medicare Part D benefit. In addition, our Medicare Advantage SNPs provide tailored benefits to special needs individuals who are institutionalized or have severe or disabling chronic conditions and to dual-eligible customers, who are low-income seniors and persons under age 65 with disabilities. Medicare Advantage SNPs are coordinated care plans specifically designed to provide targeted care, covering all the healthcare services considered medically necessary for members and often providing professional care coordination services, with personal guidance and programs that help members maintain their health. Medicare Advantage membership also includes Medicare Advantage members in our Group Retiree Solutions business who are related to National Accounts, retired members of Local Group accounts, or retired members of groups who are not affiliated with our Commercial accounts who have selected a Medicare Advantage product through us. Medicare Part D offers a prescription drug plan to Medicare and MMP beneficiaries. MMP, which was established as a result of the passage of the ACA, is a demonstration program focused on serving members who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. Medicare business accounted for 5.5%, 5.2% and 4.6% of our medical members at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.•Medicaid membership represents eligible members who receive healthcare benefits through publicly funded healthcare programs, including Medicaid, ACA-related Medicaid expansion programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, programs for seniors and people with disabilities, Children’s Health Insurance Programs, and specialty programs such as those focused on long-term services and support, HIV/AIDS, foster care, behavioral health and/or substance abuse disorders, and intellectual disabilities or developmental disabilities, among others. Total Medicaid program business accounted for 20.6%, 17.7% and 16.8% of our medical members at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.-52-•FEHB members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. FEHB business accounted for 3.8% of our medical members at December 31, 2020 and 3.9% at both December 31, 2019 and 2018.In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two principal funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ healthcare costs. Some self-funded customers choose to purchase stop loss coverage to limit their retained risk.-53-The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Also included below is other membership by product. At this time, the following table does not include membership resulting from our acquisition of Beacon. The medical membership and other membership presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

Local Group membership decreased due to negative in-group changes as a result of increased unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, -54-which was partially offset by sales exceeding lapses. Self-funded medical membership increased primarily as a result of membership increases in our National Accounts business driven by our acquisition of a third-party administrator. Medicaid membership increased primarily due to organic growth in existing markets due to the temporary suspension of eligibility recertification during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as our acquisition of Medicaid plans in Missouri and Nebraska in 2020. Medicare membership increased primarily due to higher sales.Other MembershipOur other membership can be impacted by changes in our medical membership, as our medical members often purchase our other products that are ancillary to our health business. Life and disability membership decreased due to higher lapses in our fully-insured Local Group business. Dental membership increased primarily due to new sales and growth in our National Accounts and membership growth in our FEHB program, as well as new sales in our Individual product offerings. Dental administration membership decreased due to the lapse of a large dental administration services contract. Vision membership increased due to higher sales in our Medicare and Local Group businesses.

Premiums are included in total operating revenue presented above.-55-3bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%.4Selling, general and administrative expense ratio represents selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total operating revenue.Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019 Total operating revenue increased as a result of higher premium revenue due mainly to membership growth in our Government Business segment related to our Medicaid and Medicare businesses and rate increases designed to cover the impact of the HIP Fee reinstatement for 2020. The increase in operating revenue was further attributable to an increase in pharmacy product revenue as we completed the transition of all of our unaffiliated PBM customers to IngenioRx between the second quarter of 2019 and January 1, 2020. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by a decrease in premiums in our Commercial & Specialty Business segment related to fully-insured membership declines as a result of increased unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Net investment income decreased primarily due to losses from other invested assets and lower yields on our short term investments. The losses on our other invested assets were primarily due to losses from energy sector private equity funds recognized in 2020 as a result of a decrease in the worldwide demand for energy due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Net realized gains on financial instruments increased primarily due to the changes in the fair values of our investments in equity securities. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in net realized gains on sales of equity securities. Benefit expense increased primarily due to increased costs as a result of growth in our Medicaid and Medicare membership and overall cost trends across our businesses including increased expense to cover COVID-19 related costs such as testing, treatment, expanded coverage of insurance benefits, waivers for cost-sharing and actions taken to support our members in response to the pandemic. These increases were partially offset by the lower volume of healthcare claims experienced resulting from decreased utilization of non-COVID-19 health services during the COVID-19 pandemic.Our benefit expense ratio decreased primarily due to the COVID-19 impact of lower utilization rates of healthcare benefits, and to a lesser extent, the HIP Fee reinstatement for 2020. These decreases were partially offset by increased benefit costs associated with actions taken to support our members in response to the pandemic and COVID-19 related care. The decreases were further offset by the impact of retroactive rate adjustments in our Medicaid business and premium credits provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to our members enrolled in select Individual plans and fully-insured employer customers.Cost of products sold increased as we completed the transition of all of our unaffiliated PBM customers to IngenioRx between the second quarter of 2019, when it began its operations, and January 1, 2020. Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to the reinstatement of the HIP Fee for 2020 and increased spend to support growth in our businesses. The increase was further due to the recognition of expenses related to our business optimization initiatives and the BCBSA Litigation during 2020.Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio increased as a result of the higher selling, general and administrative expenses discussed above, partially offset by the growth in operating revenue.Our effective income tax rate increased primarily due to the reinstatement of the non-tax deductible HIP Fee for 2020. Our net income as a percentage of total revenue decreased as a result of all factors discussed above.Reportable Segments Results of OperationsBeginning in 2020, IngenioRx met the quantitative thresholds for a reportable segment and the results of our operations are now described through four reportable segments: Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, IngenioRx and Other. We use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expense. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains (losses) on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, loss on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. -56-The discussion of segment results presented below is based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definition of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We use these measures as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, forecasting future operating periods and setting incentive compensation targets. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income before income tax expense, net income or EPS, prepared in accordance with GAAP. For our 2019 segment reporting, operating gain generated from IngenioRx activities were allocated and included in our Commercial & Specialty Business and Government Business based upon their utilization of those services, which aligns with the method by which we assessed the 2019 operating performance of our reportable segments. Beginning January 1, 2020, we are managing the operating performance of each of our segments on a standalone basis. Prior year 2019 allocations were not restated to conform to the 2020 presentation; however, operating margins for IngenioRx were approximately 8% in 2019. For additional information, see Note 20, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The following table presents a summary of our reportable segment financial information for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018: Change Years Ended December 312020 vs. 20192019 vs. 2018 202020192018$%$%Operating RevenueCommercial & Specialty Business$36,699 $37,421 $35,782 $(722)(1.9)%$1,639 4.6 %Government Business71,572 62,632 55,348 8,940 14.3 %7,284 13.2 %IngenioRx21,911 5,402 — 16,509 305.6 %5,402 NMOther6,057 2,293 1,519 3,764 164.2 %774 51.0 %Eliminations(15,431)(4,607)(1,308)(10,824)234.9 %(3,299)252.2 %Total operating revenue$120,808 $103,141 $91,341 $17,667 17.1 %$11,800 12.9 %Operating Gain (Loss)Commercial & Specialty Business1$2,681 $4,032 $3,600 (1,351)(33.5)%432 12.0 %Government Business22,444 2,056 1,928 388 18.9 %128 6.6 %IngenioRx31,361 — — 1,361 NM— NMOther4(126)(89)(102)(37)41.6 %13 (12.7)%Operating MarginCommercial & Specialty Business7.3 10.8 %10.1 %(350)bp570bp5Government Business3.4 3.3 %3.5 %10bp5(20)bp5IngenioRx6.2 — %NMNMNMNM Not meaningful.1Includes expenses of $524 for the BCBSA Litigation and $311 for business optimization initiatives recognized in 2020. 2 Includes expenses of $205 for business optimization initiatives and $24 for the BCBSA Litigation recognized in 2020.3 Includes expenses of $4 for business optimization initiatives recognized in 2020.4 Includes expenses of $133 for business optimization initiatives recognized in 2020.5 bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%.Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019 Commercial & Specialty BusinessOperating revenue decreased primarily due to fully-insured membership declines as a result of increased unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in operating revenue was further attributable to the absence of pharmacy -57-administrative fee revenue that is now being recognized within the IngenioRx segment and the impact of premium credits provided to certain members in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by higher premium revenue resulting from rate increases designed to cover the impact of the HIP Fee reinstatement for 2020.The decrease in operating gain was primarily driven by costs associated with actions taken to support our members and providers in response to the pandemic and COVID-19 related care, as well as expenses for the BCBSA Litigation and business optimization initiatives recognized in 2020. The decrease was further attributable to the shift of pharmacy earnings to our IngenioRx segment and the impact of premium credits provided to certain members in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of the lower volume of healthcare claims attributable to decreased utilization of non-COVID-19 health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Government BusinessOperating revenue increased primarily due to higher premium revenue as a result of membership growth in our Medicaid business driven by the temporary suspension of eligibility recertification efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic, acquisitions and new expansions, as well as membership growth in our Medicare business. The increase in premium revenue was further attributable to the HIP Fee reinstatement for 2020.The increase in operating gain was primarily driven by the lower volume of healthcare claims attributable to decreased utilization of non-COVID-19 health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was partially offset by costs associated with actions taken to support our members in response to the pandemic and COVID-19 related care and retroactive rate adjustments and higher experience-rated refunds in our Medicaid business. The increase in operating gain was further offset by increased spend to support growth and expenses for business optimization initiatives recognized in 2020.IngenioRxOperating revenue and operating gain increased as a result of the transition of our existing members to IngenioRx, which commenced its operations during the second quarter of 2019. Operating revenue represents product revenues from services performed for our fully-insured affiliated health plans and self-funded customers and external customers outside of the health plans we own. Product revenues and cost of goods sold for our fully-insured affiliated health plan customers are eliminated in consolidation. Operating gain represents operating revenue less cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expenses.OtherOperating revenue increased due to our acquisition of Beacon in February 2020 and higher administrative fees and other revenue from services performed by DBG in certain markets.The increase in operating loss was driven by expenses recognized for our business optimization initiatives.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider our most important accounting policies that require significant estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our other significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third-party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. Estimates can require a significant amount of judgment, and a different set of assumptions could result in material changes to our reported results.-58-Medical Claims Payable The most subjective accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2020, this liability was $11,359 and represented 21% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 96%, or $10,925, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2020; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 4%, or $434, of the total medical claims payable as of December 31, 2020. The level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period-end to the next, from approximately 1% to 5% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made.Liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in the aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be appropriate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that uses both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period-end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and healthcare trend levels (“trend factors”). Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison to prior periods, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather, the availability of additional paid claims information drives changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense. The impact from COVID-19 on healthcare utilization and medical claims submission patterns has increased estimation uncertainty on our incurred but not reported liability at December 31, 2020. Slowdowns in claims submission patterns and increases in utilization levels for COVID-19 testing and treatment during the fourth quarter of 2020 are the primary factors that lead to the increased estimation uncertainty.We regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are materially different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of healthcare costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable.-59-While there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid claims liability as of December 31, 2020 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations.There is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through twelve months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. In our analysis for the claim liabilities at December 31, 2020, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 40 and 90 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower estimated variability ranging from 0 to 30 basis points.The difference in completion factor assumptions, assuming moderately adverse experience, results in variability of 2%, or approximately $204, in the December 31, 2020 incurred but not paid claims liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein.The other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2020 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. In our analysis for the period ended December 31, 2020, there was a 320 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors assuming moderately adverse experience. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 4%, or approximately $427, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factors used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claims liability at December 31, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on 2020 dates of service. Our expenses associated with COVID-19 accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2020 and exceeded the benefit from lower volume of healthcare claims attributable to decreased utilization of non-COVID-19 health services. We will continue to monitor emerging experience in order to better understand the possible implications to our reserves.See Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year.” Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. The ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 87.7% for 2020, 89.3% for 2019 and 90.2% for 2018. This ratio serves as an indicator of claims processing speed whereby 2020 claims were processed at a slower speed than in 2019 and 2018. We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this metric was 8.0%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2019 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this metric was 7.4%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2018 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, this metric was 13.7%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2017 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2017.We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred -60-medical claims. We believe this calculation supports the reasonableness of our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims and the consistency in our methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this metric was 0.8%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $637. This metric was 0.7% for 2019 and 1.3% for 2018. We believe these metrics demonstrate an appropriate level of reserve conservatism.The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for each of 2019 and 2018 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims – current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims – prior years redundancies” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 20192018Total net incurred medical claims, as reported$78,195 $68,651 Retrospective basis, as described above78,058 69,081 Variance$137 $(430)Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported0.2 %(0.6)%Given that our business is primarily short tailed (which means that medical claims are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider), the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2020 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2021.The 2019 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of 0.2% was greater than the 2018 percentage of (0.6)%. This was driven by the fact that the change in the prior year redundancy reported for 2020 as compared to 2019 was greater than the change in the prior year redundancy reported for 2019 as compared to 2018.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance, which requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance.At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following:•the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset;•the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim;•the tax rate at which the deferred tax assets will likely be utilized in the future;•the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and•any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences.We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits, as required by the applicable guidance. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more -61-than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted.In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law, and we intend to defend our positions vigorously through the federal, state and local appeals processes. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact on our results of operations or financial condition from these matters.For additional information, see Note 8, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsOur consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2020 was $21,691 and other intangible assets were $9,405. The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets represented 35.9% of our total consolidated assets and 93.7% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2020.We follow FASB guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, which include goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately.We complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. These tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Certain interim impairment tests are also performed when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, which is an indication that our goodwill may be impaired. These qualitative impairment tests include assessing events and factors that could affect the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our procedures include assessing our financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, various asset specific factors and entity specific events. If we determine that a reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired after utilizing these qualitative impairment analysis procedures, we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test.Our quantitative impairment test utilizes the projected income and market valuation approaches for goodwill and the projected income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. Use of the projected income and market valuation approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. The projected income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. These estimated future cash flows are then discounted. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted-average cost of capital. Market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including revenue; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; and book value of invested capital (debt and equity) and include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry.We did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2020 annual impairment tests, as it was determined that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying values as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, we do not believe that the estimated fair values of our reporting units are at risk of becoming impaired in the next twelve months. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.-62-For additional information, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions” and Note 10, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. InvestmentsCurrent and long-term marketable investment securities were $25,554 at December 31, 2020 and represented 29.5% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2020. We classify fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” and report those securities at fair value. Certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity.Our impairment review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors. Such factors considered include the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. Prior to 2020, our fixed maturity securities were evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment where credit-related impairments were presented within the other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income with an adjustment to the security’s amortized cost basis. Effective January 1, 2020, if a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we write down the fixed maturity security’s cost basis to fair value and record an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, we recognize the credit component of the impairment as an allowance for credit loss in our consolidated balance sheets and record an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. The non-credit component of the impairment is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit-related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The credit component of an impairment is determined primarily by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of purchase. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral, including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default.We have a committee of accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. We have established an allowance for credit loss and recorded credit loss expense as a reflection of our expected impairment losses. Given the inherent uncertainty of changes in market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional impairment losses on investments may be recorded in future periods. In addition to marketable investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $4,285, or 4.9% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2020. These long-term investments consisted primarily of certain other equity investments, the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and real estate. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term.The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to prevent its spread have significantly impacted the global economy, causing market instability and declines in the fair value of our investment holdings in the energy sector and consumer-driven -63-industries such as travel, entertainment and retail. While the markets have stabilized since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent and length of the recovery remain uncertain. Further, the energy sector and consumer-driven industries remain distressed. Given this market uncertainty, there is a risk that our investments that have declined may not recover in future periods.Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits on investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future results of operations and financial condition. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $23,995 at December 31, 2020. The weighted-average credit rating of these securities was “A” as of December 31, 2020. Included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions of $1,010 that are guaranteed by third parties. With the exception of twenty-one securities with a fair value of $34, these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2020. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors, and we do not have any material exposure to any single guarantor, neither indirectly through the guarantees, nor directly through investment in the guarantor. Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of the fixed maturity securities without a guarantee, for which such information is available, was “A” as of December 31, 2020.Fair values of fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third-party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with FASB guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. We have controls in place to review the pricing services’ qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. In addition, we periodically review the pricing services’ pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable.We obtain quoted market prices for each security from the pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in these valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform analysis on the prices received from the pricing services to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes procedures such as a review of month-to-month price fluctuations and price comparisons to secondary pricing services. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from the pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.In certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. Such securities are designated Level III in accordance with FASB guidance. Securities designated Level III at December 31, 2020 totaled $392 and represented approximately 1.3% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level III securities primarily consisted of certain corporate securities and equity securities for which observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields.For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” and Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” Note 5, “Investments,” and Note 7, “Fair Value,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Retirement BenefitsPension BenefitsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for some of our employees. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FASB guidance for retirement benefits, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by the guidance, we calculate the value of plan assets as described below. Further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods. -64-An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our December 31, 2020 measurement date, we selected a weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.72%. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and an average of historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase.This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. We apply a corridor approach to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. Under this approach, only accumulated net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the average remaining service or lifetime of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date. We use the annual spot rate approach for setting our discount rate. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot rates from a full yield curve of published rates are used to discount each plan’s cash flows to determine the plan’s obligation. At the December 31, 2020 measurement date, the weighted-average discount rate under the annual spot rate approach was 2.24%, compared to 3.11% at the December 31, 2019 measurement date. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FASB guidance.In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of equity securities, investment grade fixed maturity securities and other types of investments across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow.Effective January 1, 2019, we curtailed the benefits under the Anthem Cash Balance Plan B pension plan. All grandfathered participants no longer have pay credits added to their accounts, but continue to earn interest on existing account balances. Participants continue to earn years of pension service for vesting purposes.Other Postretirement BenefitsWe provide most associates with certain medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate and the expected trend in healthcare costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits.At our December 31, 2020 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 1.99%, compared to a discount rate of 2.93% at the December 31, 2019 measurement rate. We developed this rate using the annual spot rate approach as described above. The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of pre-Medicare (those who are not currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2020 measurement date was 7.00% for 2021 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2033. The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of post-Medicare (those who are currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2020 measurement date was 5.50% for 2021 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2033. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future.For additional information regarding our retirement benefits, see Note 11, “Retirement Benefits,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.-65-New Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended December 31, 2020 that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures, see the “Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance” and “Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted” sections of Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital Resources IntroductionOur cash receipts result primarily from premiums, product revenue, administrative fees and other revenue, investment income, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity.The COVID-19 pandemic and the related mitigation efforts have significantly impacted the economy, causing market instability and increasing unemployment in the United States. While the full impact of COVID-19 on our business remains uncertain, it could have a material adverse effect on our claim payments, collection of our premiums, product or administrative fee revenues, our investments and our ability to access credit. Additional discussion regarding the impact of COVID-19 can be found elsewhere in this MD&A.We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy.To preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility and to minimize the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we proactively took several actions during 2020, including borrowing under our senior revolving credit facility in March 2020, which was repaid in April 2020; delaying certain tax payments as permitted by the IRS and the CARES Act; and temporarily suspending our share repurchase activity in March 2020, which was resumed in late June 2020. We may take additional actions going forward to maximize our liquidity, including increasing our borrowings from existing or new Federal Home Loan Bank memberships and other available borrowings. We will continue to monitor the market conditions and seek to act in a prudent manner.A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations.The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. The securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility, although current market conditions are more stable. During recent years, the federal government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. In addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide stability and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions. Further, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government has established a number of programs to provide liquidity to the financial system that provides lending to states, municipalities, and eligible businesses. -66-A summary of our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows: Years Ended December 31$ Change 2020201920182020 vs. 20192019 vs. 2018Sources of Cash:Net cash provided by operating activities$10,688 $6,061 $3,827 $4,627 $2,234 Proceeds from sales, maturities, calls and redemptions of investments, net of purchases— — 1,929 — (1,929)Issuance of common stock under Equity Units stock purchase contracts— — 1,250 — (1,250)Issuances of commercial paper and short- and long-term debt, net of repayments— 608 — (608)608 Issuances of common stock under employee stock plans176 187 173 (11)14 Other sources of cash, net315 — — 315 — Total sources of cash11,179 6,856 7,179 4,323 (323)Uses of Cash:Purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales, maturities, calls and redemptions(3,433)(1,919)— (1,514)(1,919)Repurchase and retirement of common stock(2,700)(1,701)(1,685)(999)(16)Purchases of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired(1,976)— (1,760)(1,976)1,760 Purchases of property and equipment(1,021)(1,077)(1,208)56 131 Repayments of commercial paper and short- and long-term debt, net of issuances(298)— (1,086)(298)1,086 Cash dividends(954)(818)(776)(136)(42)Other uses of cash, net— (338)(337)338 (1)Total uses of cash(10,382)(5,853)(6,852)(4,529)999 Effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents7 — (2)7 2 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents$804 $1,003 $325 $(199)$678 Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the impact of the timing of working capital changes. The increase was further due to membership growth in our Government Business segment and higher net income in 2020, excluding the non-cash impact of accrued expenses related to our business optimization initiatives and the BCBSA Litigation.Other significant changes in sources and uses of cash year-over-year included increases in cash used for acquisitions, net purchases of investments and cash used for repurchase and retirement of common stock.Financial ConditionWe maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities of $31,295 at December 31, 2020. Since December 31, 2019, total cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $5,168, primarily due to cash generated from operations. This increase was partially offset by cash used for common stock repurchases, acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment and cash dividends paid to shareholders. Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Certain accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities, or statutory accounting practices, differ from GAAP. Changes that occur in statutory accounting practices, if any, could impact our subsidiaries’ future dividend capacity. In addition, we have agreed to certain -67-undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries.At December 31, 2020, we held $1,747 of cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company, which are available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, potential future common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders, repurchases of debt securities and debt and interest payments. DebtPeriodically, we access capital markets and issue debt (“Notes”) for long-term borrowing purposes, for example, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. Certain of these Notes may have a call feature that allows us to redeem the Notes at any time at our option and/or a put feature that allows a Note holder to redeem the Notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating. For more information on our debt, including redemptions and issuances, see Note 13, “Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We calculate our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, a non-GAAP measure, from the amounts presented on our audited consolidated balance sheets included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total debt plus total shareholders’ equity. Total debt is the sum of short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, long-term debt, less current portion, and lease liabilities. We believe our debt-to-capital ratio assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. In addition, our bank covenants include a maximum debt-to-capital ratio that we cannot and did not exceed. Our debt-to-capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio was 38.7% and 39.5% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our senior debt is rated “A” by S&P Global, “BBB” by Fitch Ratings, Inc., “Baa2” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by limitations on future borrowings and a potential increase in our borrowing costs.Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity We have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries and the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansions.We have a senior revolving credit facility (the “5-Year Facility”) with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. In June 2019, we amended and restated the credit agreement for the 5-Year Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date from August 2020 to June 2024 and decrease the amount of credit available from $3,500 to $2,500. In June 2019, we also entered into a 364-day senior revolving credit facility (the “364-Day Facility”) with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes, which provides for credit in the amount of $1,000. In May 2020, we amended and extended the 364-Day Facility, which now matures in June 2021. Our ability to borrow under these credit facilities is subject to compliance with certain covenants. We do not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect our financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. There were no amounts outstanding under the 5-Year Facility or the 364-Day Facility at December 31, 2020.Through certain subsidiaries, we have entered into multiple 364-day lines of credit (the “Subsidiary Credit Facilities”) with separate lenders for general corporate purposes. The Subsidiary Credit Facilities provide combined credit up to $300. Our ability to borrow under the Subsidiary Credit Facilities is subject to compliance with certain covenants. At December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Subsidiary Credit Facilities. We have a $3,500 commercial paper program, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we have the ability to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our two senior revolving credit facilities, which provide for combined credit in the amount of $3,500, to redeem any outstanding commercial -68-paper upon maturity. While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we believe the lenders participating in our credit facilities, if market conditions allow, would be willing to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. At December 31, 2020, we had $250 outstanding under our commercial paper program.We are a member, through certain subsidiaries, of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, collectively (the “FHLBs”). As a member, we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. At December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding short-term borrowings from the FHLBs.As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we currently estimate that approximately $2,505 of dividends will be paid to the parent company during 2021. During 2020, we received $3,618 of dividends from our subsidiaries.We regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions, common stock and debt security repurchases and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. On January 26, 2021, our Audit Committee declared a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $1.13 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on March 25, 2021 to the shareholders of record as of March 10, 2021.Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2020, we had Board authorization of $1,092 to repurchase our common stock. On January 26, 2021, our Audit Committee, pursuant to authorization granted by the Board of Directors, authorized a $5,000 increase to our common stock repurchase program.For additional information regarding our sources and uses of capital, see Note 5, “Investments,” Note 6, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” Note 13, “Debt” and Note 15, “Capital Stock–Use of Capital–Dividends and Stock Repurchase Program” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020 are as follows: Payments Due by PeriodTotalLess than1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsMore than5 YearsOn-Balance Sheet:Debt1 $31,066 $1,679 $3,953 $17,641 $7,793 Operating leases, including imputed interest2982 197 336 213 236 Investment commitments320 11 7 1 1 Other long-term liabilities4 716 9 284 281 142 Off-Balance Sheet:Purchase obligations55,761 975 3,143 1,523 120 Operating leases, including imputed interest2139 6 24 24 85 Investment commitments61,320 270 448 61 541 Total contractual obligations and commitments$40,004 $3,147 $8,195 $19,744 $8,918 1Includes estimated interest expense. 2See Note 18, “Leases,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.-69-3Represents low income housing tax credits.4Primarily consists of reserves for future policy benefits, projected other postretirement benefits, deferred compensation, supplemental executive retirement plan liabilities and certain other miscellaneous long-term obligations. Estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from this table, as we had no funding requirements under ERISA at December 31, 2020 as a result of the value of the assets in the plans. 5Includes estimated payments for future services under contractual arrangements from third-party service contracts.6Includes unfunded capital commitments for alternative investments.The above table does not contain $282 of gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions and interest for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities. For further information, see Note 8, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our senior revolving credit facilities and/or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet derivative instruments, guarantee transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements or any indemnification agreements that will require funding in future periods. We have not transferred assets to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not hold any variable interest in an unconsolidated entity where such entity provides us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support.Risk-Based CapitalOur regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for health and other insurance companies and HMOs largely based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) Risk-Based Capital (RBC) For Health Organizations Model Act (“RBC Model Act”). These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under the RBC Model Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our regulated subsidiaries’ respective RBC levels as of December 31, 2020, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, were in excess of all applicable mandatory RBC requirements. In addition to exceeding these RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries.For additional information, see Note 22, “Statutory Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. (In Millions, Except As Otherwise Stated Herein)As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2020. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return.-70-InvestmentsOur investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk.The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit event, such as a ratings downgrade or default, to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that event. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately “A.” Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which have exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value.Investments in fixed maturity securities include corporate securities, which account for 45.4% of our total fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2020 and are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase, prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. We manage this risk through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of our corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately “BBB.”Market risk for fixed maturity securities is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $998 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $1,039 increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and the duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly.Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities, exchange-traded funds and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systemic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio.Our other invested assets, reported within our long-term investments, are primarily subject to private market exposures, including private equity, real estate, and private credit investments. These investments are also indirectly subject to market valuation risk, as public market valuations will form a basis for valuations for these investments. Given their illiquid nature, we focus on appropriate sizing of these investments relative to our liquidity needs and risk tolerance. Our risk tolerance is formed by the level of illiquidity and short-term price movements from market valuation risk we are willing to accept relative to the higher long-term expected returns over the life of these investments.As of December 31, 2020, 6.1% of our marketable investments were equity securities. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $156. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $156.For additional information regarding our investments, see Note 5, “Investments,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Investments” within Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.-71-Long-Term DebtOur total long-term debt at December 31, 2020 consisted of senior unsecured notes, convertible debentures, commercial paper and subordinated surplus notes issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2020, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $20,035 and $24,269, respectively. This debt is subject to interest rate risk, as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. For additional information regarding our long-term debt, see Note 7, “Fair Value” and Note 13, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Derivatives We have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts, which are used to lock-in interest rates or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. We have used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities.Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these derivatives. As of December 31, 2020, we recorded a net asset of $37, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swaps’ fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $18 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $18 increase in fair value.For additional information regarding our derivatives, see Note 6, “Derivative Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. -72-",2023-12-30 18:52:24.257928

(In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein) This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”), should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. References to the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Anthem” or the “Company” used throughout this MD&A refer to Anthem, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and, unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries. References to the “states” include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, unless the context otherwise requires.This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. A detailed discussion of 2019 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. OverviewWe are one of the largest health benefits companies in the United States in terms of medical membership, serving greater than 45 million medical members through our affiliated health plans as of December 31, 2021. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (“BCBSA”), an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield (“BCBS”) licensee for Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (in the New York City metropolitan area and upstate New York), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas, we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield or Empire Blue Cross. In addition, we conduct business through arrangements with other BCBS licensees as well as other strategic partners. Through our subsidiaries, we also serve customers in numerous states across the country as AIM Specialty Health, Amerigroup, Aspire Health, Beacon, CareMore, Freedom Health, HealthLink, HealthSun, MMM, Optimum HealthCare, Simply Healthcare, and/or UniCare. We offer pharmacy benefits management (“PBM”) services through our IngenioRx, Inc. (“IngenioRx”) subsidiary. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico through our subsidiaries. We manage our operations by customer types through four reportable segments: Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, IngenioRx and Other.Our results of operations discussed throughout this MD&A are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We also calculate operating gain and operating margin to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expense. Operating margin is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definition of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We use these measures as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, forecasting future operating periods and setting incentive compensation targets. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income before income tax expense, net income or fully-diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) prepared in accordance with GAAP. For additional details on operating gain, see our “Reportable Segments Results of Operations” discussion included in this MD&A. For a reconciliation of reportable segment operating revenue to the amounts of total revenue included in the consolidated statements of income and a reconciliation of reportable segment operating gain to income before income tax expense, see Note 20, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our operating revenue consists of premiums, product revenue, and administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue is generated from risk-based contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life insurance benefits. Product revenue represents services performed by IngenioRx for unaffiliated PBM customers and includes ingredient costs (net of any rebates or discounts), including co-payments made by or on behalf of the customer, and -41-administrative fees. Unaffiliated PBM customers include our fee-based groups that contract with IngenioRx for PBM services and external customers outside of the health plans we own. Administrative fees and other revenue come from fees from our fee-based customers for the processing of transactions or network discount savings realized, revenues from our Medicare processing business and revenues from other health-related businesses, including care management programs and miscellaneous other income. Our benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our risk-based members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. While we offer a diversified mix of managed care products and services through our managed care plans, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products and services. Our managed care plans include: Preferred Provider Organizations; Health Maintenance Organizations; Point-of-Service plans; traditional indemnity plans and other hybrid plans, including Consumer-Driven Health Plans; and hospital only and limited benefit products. We classify certain quality improvement costs as benefit expense. Quality improvement activities are those designed to improve member health outcomes, prevent hospital readmissions and improve patient safety. They also include expenses for wellness and health promotion provided to our members. These quality improvement costs may be comprised of expenses incurred for: (i) medical management, including care coordination and case management; (ii) health and wellness, including disease management services for such conditions as diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, congestive heart failure and asthma management and wellness initiatives like weight-loss programs and smoking cessation treatments; and (iii) clinical health policy, such as identification and use of best clinical practices to avoid harm, identifying clinical errors and safety concerns, and identifying potential adverse drug interactions. Our cost of products sold represents the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed by IngenioRx for our unaffiliated PBM customers (net of rebates or discounts), including any co-payments made by or on behalf of the customer, per-claim administrative fees for prescription fulfillment and certain direct costs related to sales and administration of customer contracts.Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Commission expense generally varies with premium or membership volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels and thus, associated compensation expense. Other variable costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity.Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage healthcare costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members, product pricing, medical management and health and wellness programs, innovative product design and our ability to maintain or achieve improvement in our Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Star ratings. Several economic factors related to healthcare costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating healthcare costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers and any regulatory or market-driven restrictions on our ability to obtain adequate premium rates to offset overall inflation in healthcare costs, including increases in unit costs and utilization resulting from the aging of the population and other demographics, the impact of epidemics and pandemics, as well as advances in medical technology, may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.We intend to expand through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and efficient use of capital in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale, as -42-well as provide us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. In 2019, we began using our subsidiary IngenioRx to market and offer PBM services, and we expect IngenioRx to continue to improve our ability to integrate pharmacy benefits within our medical and specialty platform. In 2021, we continued growing our government-sponsored business through organic growth and the acquisition of MMM Holdings, LLC (“MMM”). In all other markets, we intend to maintain our position by delivering excellent service, offering competitively priced products, providing access to high-quality provider networks and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks.For additional information about our business and reportable segments, see Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Note 20, “Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the global economy, cause market instability and uncertainty in the labor market and put pressure on the healthcare system, and it has impacted, and will likely continue to impact, our membership, our benefit expense and our member behavior, including how members access healthcare services. We continue to assist our customers, providers, members and communities in addressing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including by providing expanded benefit coverage for COVID-19 diagnostic tests, treatment and vaccine administration and taking steps to increase vaccinations by enabling, educating and encouraging vaccine acceptance among our members as well as in the communities in which we operate.COVID-19 care, testing and vaccine administration, and the impact of new COVID-19 variants, have resulted in increased medical costs for us in 2021. In 2021, our Medicaid membership continued to grow as a result of the temporary suspension of eligibility recertification in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which we expect will remain suspended at least until the second quarter of 2022. Our Commercial fee-based membership decreased in 2021 due to in-group attrition likely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Business Trends - Medical Cost Trends” below for a discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our healthcare costs.The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the full extent of its impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic as well as resulting legislative and regulatory changes to manage our response and assess and mitigate potential adverse impacts to our business. For additional discussion regarding our risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and our other risk factors, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Business TrendsThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, as amended (collectively, the “ACA”), has impacted our business model and strategy, and various legal challenges since its enactment have introduced increased uncertainty to our business. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion and dismissed the latest legal challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA, leaving the law intact. We expect that most of the ACA will continue to remain in place and continue to impact our business operations and results of operations, including pricing, minimum medical loss ratios and the geographies in which our products are available. In 2021, we made the decision to modestly expand our participation in on-exchange products through state- or federally-facilitated market places (the “Public Exchange”) for 2022 after also expanding in 2021. As a result, for 2022 we are offering Public Exchange products in 122 of the 143 rating regions in which we operate, in comparison to 103 of 143 rating regions in 2021. Our strategy has been, and will continue to be, to only participate in rating regions where we have an appropriate level of confidence that these markets are on a path toward sustainability, including, but not limited to, factors such as expected financial performance, regulatory environment, and underlying market characteristics. Changes to our business environment are likely to continue as elected officials at the national and state levels continue to enact, and both elected officials and candidates for election continue to propose, significant modifications to existing laws and regulations, including changes to taxes and fees. In addition, the continuing growth in our government-sponsored business exposes us to increased regulatory oversight.-43-Our IngenioRx subsidiary markets and offers PBM services to our affiliated health plan customers throughout the country, as well as to customers outside of the health plans we own. Our comprehensive PBM services portfolio includes features such as formulary management, pharmacy networks, a prescription drug database, member services and mail order capabilities. IngenioRx delegates certain PBM administrative functions, such as claims processing and prescription fulfillment, to CaremarkPCS Health, L.L.C., which is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corporation, pursuant to a five-year agreement. With IngenioRx, we retain the responsibilities for clinical and formulary strategy and development, member and employer experiences, operations, sales, marketing, account management and retail network strategy.Pricing Trends: We strive to price our health benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical cost trends. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic (including new COVID-19 variants, which may be more contagious or severe, or less responsive to treatment or vaccines) and the impacts it may have on our pricing, such as surges in COVID-19 related hospitalizations, infection rates, the cost of COVID-19 vaccines, testing and treatment and the return of non-COVID-19 healthcare utilization to our estimate of normal levels, based on historical utilization patterns. We frequently make adjustments to respond to legislative and regulatory changes as well as pricing and other actions taken by existing competitors and new market entrants. Product pricing in our Commercial & Specialty Business segment, including our Individual and small group lines of business, remains competitive. Revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government and/or applicable state governments. The ACA imposed an annual Health Insurance Provider Fee (“HIP Fee”) on health insurers that write certain types of health insurance on U.S. risks. We priced our affected products to cover the impact of the HIP Fee when it was in effect. The HIP Fee was in effect for 2020 but was permanently repealed beginning in 2021.Medical Cost Trends: Our medical cost trends are primarily driven by increases in the utilization of services across all provider types and the unit cost increases of these services. We work to mitigate these trends through various medical management programs such as care and condition management, program integrity and specialty pharmacy management and utilization management, as well as benefit design changes. There are many drivers of medical cost trends that can cause variance from our estimates, such as changes in the level and mix of services utilized, regulatory changes, aging of the population, health status and other demographic characteristics of our members, epidemics, pandemics, advances in medical technology, new high cost prescription drugs, and healthcare provider or member fraud.The COVID-19 pandemic initially caused a decrease in utilization of non-COVID-19 health services, which decreased our claim costs in 2020. Over the course of the first half of 2021, our non-COVID-19 healthcare utilization experience gradually increased toward normalized levels, while COVID-19 related healthcare expenses declined and COVID-19 vaccination administration costs increased. During the second half of 2021, the COVID-19 Delta variant caused a significant increase in COVID-19 related healthcare utilization as a result of increased testing, treatment, and hospitalization costs, which was partially offset by a reduction in non-COVID-19 healthcare utilization. The reduction in non-COVID-19 healthcare utilization was particularly notable in the inpatient setting, as some regions limited elective surgeries to preserve limited resources to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Costs related to child vaccinations and adult boosters were also incurred during the fourth quarter of 2021.The COVID-19 Omicron variant increased confirmed COVID-19 cases to significant levels at the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022. This is expected to further increase COVID-19 costs related to testing, treatment and hospitalization costs, but is expected to be partially offset by a reduction in non-COVID-19 healthcare utilization. In 2022, we anticipate additional claim costs for new pharmaceutical treatments for COVID-19 and compliance with governmental regulations on COVID-19 testing reimbursement. We expect claims costs related to COVID-19 testing, treatment and hospitalizations to continue throughout 2022 even after the latest wave of COVID-19 infections in the U.S. subsides. The continued cost and volume of covered services related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our future claim costs. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations and medical cost trends. For additional discussion regarding business trends, see Part I, Item 1, “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesFederal and state governments have enacted, and may continue to enact, legislation and regulations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that have had, and we expect will continue to have, a significant impact on health benefits, consumer -44-eligibility for public programs and our cash flows for all of our lines of business. These actions, which are or have been in effect for various durations, provide, among other things:•mandates to waive cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing, treatment (including over-the-counter testing in accordance with state and federal requirements such as California SB 510 and the January 2022 federal requirements), vaccines and related services;•reforms, including waiving Medicare originating site restrictions for qualified providers of telehealth services;•financial support to healthcare providers, including expansion of the Medicare accelerated payment program to all providers receiving Medicare payments;•mandated expansion of premium payment terms, including the time period for which claims can be denied for lack of payment; and•mandates related to prior authorizations and payment levels to providers, additional consumer enrollment windows and an increased ability to provide telehealth services.The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, which was enacted in December 2020 (the “Appropriations Act”), contains a number of provisions that may have a material effect upon our business, including procedures and coverage requirements related to surprise medical bills and new mandates for continuity of care for certain patients, price comparison tools, disclosure of broker compensation and reporting on pharmacy benefits and drug costs. The health plan-related requirements of the Appropriations Act have varying effective dates beginning as early as December 2021, some of which have been extended since the enactment of the Appropriations Act. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, (the “Rescue Plan”), which was enacted in March 2021, contains several health-related provisions that have impacted our business, including expansion of premium tax credits for our Public Exchange business and full subsidization of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“COBRA”) continuation coverage for those who were involuntarily terminated or had their work hours reduced. The Rescue Plan’s premium tax provisions became effective in January 2021, while the COBRA premium subsidization extended from April through September 2021.The ACA has evolved and various legal challenges since its enactment introduced increased uncertainty to our business. We expect that most of the ACA will remain in place and continue to significantly impact our business operations and results of operations; however, federal regulatory agencies continue to modify regulations and guidance related to the ACA and our businesses more broadly. We also expect further and ongoing regulatory guidance on a number of issues related to Medicare, including evolving methodology for ratings and quality bonus payments. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) is also proposing changes to its program that audits data submitted under the risk adjustment programs in a way that would increase financial recoveries from plans. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the ACA as any further developments or judicial rulings occur.Beginning in July 2022, the Health Plan Transparency Rule will require us to disclose, on a monthly basis, detailed pricing information regarding negotiated rates for all covered items and services between the plan or issuer and in-network providers and historical payments to, and billed charges from, out-of-network providers. Additionally, beginning in 2023, we will be required to make available to members personalized out-of-pocket cost information and the underlying negotiated rates for 500 covered healthcare items and services, including prescription drugs. In 2024, this requirement will expand to all items and services.The non-deductible HIP Fee was permanently eliminated beginning in 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $1,570 as selling, general and administrative expense related to the HIP Fee. There was no corresponding expense for 2021 due to the elimination of the HIP Fee beginning in 2021.For additional discussion regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, and risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, see Part I, Item 1, “Business — Regulation” and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”-45-Other Significant ItemsBusiness and Operational Matters On November 10, 2021, we announced our entrance into an agreement with Personal Touch Holding Corporation to acquire Integra Managed Care (“Integra”). Integra is a managed long-term care plan that serves New York state Medicaid members, enabling adults with long-term care needs and disabilities to live safely and independently in their own homes. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2022 and is subject to standard closing conditions and customary approvals.On June 29, 2021, we completed our acquisition of MMM and its Medicare Advantage plan, Medicaid plan and other affiliated companies from InnovaCare Health, L.P. MMM is a Puerto Rico-based integrated healthcare organization and seeks to provide its Medicare Advantage and Medicaid members with a whole health experience through its network of specialized clinics and wholly owned independent physician associations. This acquisition aligns with our vision to be an innovative, valuable and inclusive healthcare partner by providing care management programs that improve the lives of the people we serve.On April 28, 2021, we completed our acquisition of myNEXUS, Inc. (“myNEXUS”) from WindRose Health Investors. myNEXUS is a comprehensive home-based nursing management company for payors and, at the time of acquisition, delivered integrated clinical support services for Medicare Advantage members across twenty states. This acquisition aligns with our strategy to manage integrated, whole person multi-site care and support by providing national, large-scale expertise to manage nursing services in the home and facilitate transitions of care. On February 28, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Beacon Health Options, Inc. (“Beacon”), which was the largest independently held behavioral health organization in the country. At the time of acquisition, Beacon served more than thirty-four million individuals across all fifty states. This acquisition aligned with our strategy to diversify into health services and deliver both integrated solutions and care delivery models that personalize care for people with complex and chronic conditions.For additional information, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementsincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.In 2020, we introduced enterprise-wide initiatives to optimize our business and as a result, recorded a charge of $653 in selling, general and administrative expenses. We believe these initiatives largely represent the next step forward in our progression towards becoming a more agile organization, including process automation and a reduction in our office space footprint. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we identified additional office space reductions and related fixed asset impairments due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and recorded a charge of $202 in selling general and administrative expenses. For additional information, see Note 4, “Business Optimization Initiatives” and Note 18, “Leases,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Litigation MattersIn the consolidated multi-district proceeding in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama (the “Court”) captioned In re Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation (“BCBSA Litigation”), the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (the “BCBSA”), and Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensees, including us (the “Blue plans”) have approved a settlement agreement and release (the “Subscriber Settlement Agreement”) with the plaintiffs representing a putative nationwide class of health plan subscribers. Generally, the lawsuits in the BCBSA Litigation challenge elements of the licensing agreements between the BCBSA and the independently owned and operated Blue plans. The cases were brought by two putative nationwide classes of plaintiffs, health plan subscribers and providers, and the Subscriber Settlement Agreement applies only to the putative subscriber class. No settlement agreement has been reached with the provider plaintiffs at this time, and the defendants continue to contest the consolidated cases brought by the provider plaintiffs. If approved by the Court, the Subscriber Settlement Agreement will require the defendants to make a monetary settlement payment, our portion of which is estimated to be $594, and will include certain terms imposing non-monetary obligations on the defendants. As of December 31, 2021, the liability balance accrued for our estimated remaining payment obligation was $507, net of payments made. All terms of the Subscriber Settlement Agreement are subject to approval by the -46-Court before they become effective. For additional information regarding the BCBSA Litigation, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies – Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings – Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In January 2019, we exercised our contractual right to terminate our PBM agreement (the “ESI PBM Agreement”) with Express Scripts, Inc. (“Express Scripts”). We completed the transition of our members from Express Scripts to IngenioRx by January 1, 2020. Notwithstanding our termination of the ESI PBM Agreement, the litigation between us and Express Scripts regarding the ESI PBM Agreement continues. For additional information regarding this lawsuit, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings - Express Scripts, Inc. Pharmacy Benefit Management Litigation,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Selected Operating PerformanceDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, total medical membership increased by 2 million, or 5.7%. The increase in medical membership was driven primarily by growth in our Government Business’ Medicaid membership, including organic growth resulting from the temporary suspension of eligibility recertification during the COVID-19 pandemic, growth resulting from our acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021 and the launch of our HealthyBlue managed care alliance in North Carolina. Our Medicare Advantage membership also increased due to organic growth and the acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021. Increases in Group risk-based membership resulting from sales exceeding lapses, increases in Individual membership due to our Public Exchange expansion in 2021 and BlueCard® increases also contributed to overall membership increases. Declines in our Group fee-based membership relating to in-group attrition likely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic partially offset the increases in our medical membership.Operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $136,943, an increase of $16,135, or 13.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in operating revenue was primarily driven by higher premium revenue due mainly to membership growth in our Government Business segment, including the acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021, and increased product revenue in our IngenioRx segment. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower premium revenue associated with the repeal of the HIP Fee for 2021.Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $6,095, an increase of $1,523, or 33.3%, from the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net income was primarily due to increased operating gain in all of our business units, as well as increased investment income. The increased operating gain in our business units was due to the absence of charges in 2021 for the BCBSA litigation accrual recognized in the third quarter of 2020 and reduced business optimization charges in 2021. The increase in our investment income resulted from an increase in income derived from our alternative investments in comparison to 2020, partially offset by reduced dividends received on our equity investments.Our fully-diluted shareholders' earnings per share (“EPS”) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $24.73, an increase of $6.75, or 37.5%, from the year ended December 31, 2020. Our diluted shares for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 246.8, a decrease of 7.5, or 2.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in EPS resulted from the increase in net income, as well as lower shares outstanding in 2021.Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $8,364, or approximately 1.4 times net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $10,688, or approximately 2.3 times net income. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to the impact of working capital changes year-over-year, including an increase in receivables and a decline in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by higher net income in 2021.-47-Membership In the first quarter of 2021, we updated our medical membership reporting to better align with how we view our business. Our medical membership now includes the following customer types: Individual, Group risk-based, Group fee-based, BlueCard®, Medicare, Medicaid and our Federal Employees Health Benefits (“FEHB”) Program. BCBS-branded business generally refers to members in our service areas licensed by the BCBSA. Non-BCBS-branded business refers to members in our non-BCBS-branded Amerigroup, Freedom Health, HealthSun, MMM, Optimum HealthCare and Simply Healthcare plans, as well as HealthLink and UniCare members. In addition to the above medical membership, we also serve customers who purchase one or more of our other products or services that are often ancillary to our health business.•Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. Individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, retail partnerships, our in-house sales force or via the Public Exchanges. Individual business is sold on a risk-based basis. We offer on-exchange products through Public Exchanges and off-exchange products. Federal premium subsidies are available only for certain Public Exchange Individual products. Unsubsidized Individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network and the efficiency of administration. Customer turnover is generally higher with Individual as compared to Group risk-based. Individual business accounted for 1.7%, 1.6% and 1.7% of our medical members at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.•Group risk-based consists of employer customers who purchase products on a full-risk basis, which are products for which we charge a premium and indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Group risk-based accounts include Local Group customers and National Accounts. Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. In addition, Local Group includes Student Health members. National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in an Anthem service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker and consultant relationships. Group risk-based accounts are generally sold through brokers or consultants who work with industry specialists from our in-house sales force and are offered both on and off the Public Exchanges. Group risk-based accounted for 8.8%, 8.9% and 9.6% of our medical members at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.•Group fee-based customers represent employer groups, Local Group, including UniCare members, and National Accounts, who purchase fee-based products and elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ healthcare costs. Some fee-based customers choose to purchase stop loss coverage to limit their retained risk. Group fee-based accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. Group fee-based accounted for 42.7%, 45.5% and 47.2% of our medical members at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.•BlueCard® host customers represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by Anthem who receive healthcare services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard® membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard® program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which an Anthem subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-Anthem controlled BCBSA licensee (the “home plan”). We perform certain functions, including claims pricing and administration, for BlueCard® members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard® members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard® claims received per month. BlueCard® host membership accounted for 13.6%, 14.1% and 14.8% of our medical members at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.•Medicare customers are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, including Special Needs Plans (“SNPs”), also known as Medicare Advantage SNPs; dual-eligible programs through Medicare-Medicaid Plans (“MMPs”); Medicare Supplement plans; and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans (“Medicare Part D”). Medicare Advantage plans provide Medicare beneficiaries with a managed care alternative to traditional Medicare and often include a Medicare Part D benefit. In addition, our -48-Medicare Advantage SNPs provide tailored benefits to special needs individuals who are institutionalized or have severe or disabling chronic conditions and to dual-eligible customers, who are low-income seniors and persons under age 65 with disabilities. Medicare Advantage SNPs are coordinated care plans specifically designed to provide targeted care, covering all the healthcare services considered medically necessary for members and often providing professional care coordination services, with personal guidance and programs that help members maintain their health. Medicare Advantage membership also includes Medicare Advantage members in our Group Retiree Solutions business who are retired members of Commercial accounts or retired members of groups who are not affiliated with our Commercial accounts who have selected a Medicare Advantage product through us. Medicare Supplement plans typically pay the difference between healthcare costs incurred by a beneficiary and amounts paid by Medicare. Medicare Part D offers a prescription drug plan to Medicare and MMP beneficiaries. MMP, which was established as a result of the passage of the ACA, is a demonstration program focused on serving members who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. Medicare program business accounted for 6.2%, 5.5% and 5.2% of our medical members at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.•Medicaid membership represents eligible members who receive health benefits through publicly funded healthcare programs, including Medicaid, ACA-related Medicaid expansion programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, programs for seniors and people with disabilities, Children’s Health Insurance Programs, and specialty programs such as those focused on long-term services and support, HIV/AIDS, foster care, behavioral health and/or substance abuse disorders, and intellectual disabilities or developmental disabilities, among others. Total Medicaid program business accounted for 23.4%, 20.6% and 17.7% of our medical members at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.•FEHB members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. FEHB business accounted for 3.6%, 3.8% and 3.9% of our medical members at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.-49-The following table presents our medical membership by reportable segment and customer type as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

Our Medicare Advantage membership also increased due to organic growth and our acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021. Increases in Group risk-based membership resulting from sales exceeding lapses, increases in Individual membership due to our Public Exchange expansion in 2021 and BlueCard® increases also contributed to overall membership increases. Declines in our Group fee-based membership relating to in-group attrition likely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic partially offset the increases in our medical membership.Other MembershipOur other membership can be impacted by changes in our medical membership, as our medical members often purchase our other products that are ancillary to our health business. Life and disability membership decreased primarily due to the loss of a Group risk-based account and membership decreases in our Group fee-based business. Dental membership increased -50-primarily due to higher sales in our Individual and Group risk-based accounts and penetration increases in our FEHB program. Dental administration membership increased due to growth in our FEHB program. Vision membership increased primarily as a result of growth in our Medicare Advantage business.Consolidated Results of OperationsOur consolidated summarized results of operations and other information for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows: Change Years Ended December 312021 vs. 20202020 vs. 2019 202120202019$%$%Total operating revenue$136,943 $120,808 $103,141 $16,135 13.4 %$17,667 17.1 %Net investment income1,378 877 1,005 501 57.1 %(128)(12.7)%Net gains on financial instruments318 182 67 136 74.7 %115 171.6 %Total revenues138,639 121,867 104,213 16,772 13.8 %17,654 16.9 %Benefit expense102,645 88,045 81,786 14,600 16.6 %6,259 7.7 %Cost of products sold10,895 8,953 1,992 1,942 21.7 %6,961 NMSelling, general and administrative expense15,914 17,450 13,364 (1,536)(8.8)%4,086 30.6 %Other expense1 1,260 1,181 1,086 79 6.7 %95 8.7 %Total expenses130,714 115,629 98,228 15,085 13.0 %17,401 17.7 %Income before income tax expense 7,925 6,238 5,985 1,687 27.0 %253 4.2 %Income tax expense1,830 1,666 1,178 164 9.8 %488 41.4 %Net income6,095 4,572 4,807 1,523 33.3 %(235)(4.9)%Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 9 — — 9 — — — Shareholders’ net income$6,104 $4,572 $4,807 $1,532 33.5 %$(235)(4.9)%Average diluted shares outstanding246.8 254.3 260.3 (7.5)(2.9)%(6.0)(2.3)%Diluted shareholders' net income per share$24.73 $17.98 $18.47 $6.75 37.5 %$(0.49)(2.7)%Effective tax rate23.1 %26.7 %19.7 %(360)bp3700bp3Benefit expense ratio287.5 %84.6 %86.8 %290bp3(220)bp3Selling, general and administrative expense ratio4 11.6 %14.4 %13.0 %(280)bp3140bp3Income before income tax expense as a percentage of total revenues5.7 %5.1 %5.7 %60bp3(60)bp3Net income as a percentage of total revenues4.4 %3.8 %4.6 %60bp3(80)bp3Certain of the following definitions are also applicable to all other results of operations tables in this discussion:NM Not meaningful.1Includes interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets and loss on extinguishment of debt.2Benefit expense ratio represents benefit expense as a percentage of premium revenue.

These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower premium revenue associated with the repeal of the HIP Fee for 2021.The increase in operating gain was primarily due to the absence of charges in 2021 for the BCBSA Litigation accrual recognized in the third quarter of 2020, reduced business optimization charges in 2021 and the non-recurring premium credits provided to members enrolled in select Group and Individual health plans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the second quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by increased COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 healthcare costs in 2021.-53-Government BusinessOperating revenue increased primarily due to higher premium revenue growth in our Medicaid business, driven by the temporary suspension of eligibility recertification, which we expect will remain suspended at least until the second quarter of 2022, and the acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021. Medicare membership growth in our Medicare business and the impact of the acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021 also contributed to operating revenue growth. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower premium revenue associated with the repeal of the HIP Fee for 2021, increased experience-rated refunds in our Medicaid business and lower risk-based revenue in our Medicare business.The increase in operating gain was primarily driven by membership increases in both our Medicaid and Medicare businesses, including due to the acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021, and reduced business optimization charges in 2021. These increases were partially offset by an increase in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 healthcare costs, increased experience-rated refunds in our Medicaid business and lower risk-based revenue in our Medicare business.IngenioRxOperating revenue and operating gain increased as a result of higher drug spend from IngenioRx customers, including spend related to increased Medicaid membership within our Government Business segment.The increase in operating gain was primarily driven by growth in integrated medical and pharmacy members in 2021.OtherOperating revenue increased primarily due to higher administrative fees and other revenue for services performed by our Diversified Business Group for our Commercial & Specialty Business and Government Business segments, primarily due to the implementation of affiliated behavioral health capitation contracts. In addition, unaffiliated revenues from Beacon, AIM and myNEXUS contributed to the overall increase. The decrease in operating loss was driven by reduced business optimization charges in 2021 and a decline in unallocated corporate expenses in 2021.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider our most important accounting policies that require significant estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our other significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third-party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. Estimates can require a significant amount of judgment, and a different set of assumptions could result in material changes to our reported results.Medical Claims Payable The most subjective accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2021, this liability was $13,518 and represented 22% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 96%, or $12,998, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2021; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 4%, or $520, of the total medical claims payable as of December 31, 2021. The level of claims -54-payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period-end to the next, from approximately 1% to 5% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made.Liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in the aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Our reserving practice for claim liabilities is to consistently recognize the appropriate amount of reserve within a level of confidence required by Actuarial Standards of Practice. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that uses both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period-end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and healthcare trend levels (“trend factors”). Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison to prior periods, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather, the availability of additional paid claims information drives changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense. The impact from COVID-19 on healthcare utilization and medical claims submission patterns has increased estimation uncertainty on our incurred but not reported liability at December 31, 2021. Slowdowns in claims submission patterns and increases in utilization levels for COVID-19 testing and treatment during 2021 are the primary factors that lead to the increased estimation uncertainty.We regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are materially different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of healthcare costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable.While there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid claims liability as of December 31, 2021 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations.-55-There is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through twelve months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. In our analysis for the claim liabilities at December 31, 2021, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 40 and 90 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower estimated variability ranging from 0 to 30 basis points.The difference in completion factor assumptions results in variability of 2%, or approximately $242, in the December 31, 2021 incurred but not paid claims liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein.The other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2021 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. In our analysis for the period ended December 31, 2021, there was a 320 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 4%, or approximately $487, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factors used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claims liability at December 31, 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on 2021 dates of service. Our expenses associated with COVID-19 accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by the benefit from a lower volume of healthcare claims attributable to decreased utilization of non-COVID-19 health services. We will continue to monitor emerging experience in order to better understand the possible implications to our reserves.See Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year.” Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. The ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 87.8% for 2021, 87.7% for 2020 and 89.3% for 2019. This ratio serves as an indicator of claims processing speed whereby 2021 claims were processed at a similar speed to 2020, but slower than in 2019.We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2021, this metric was 18.1%, reflecting the estimation uncertainty due to COVID-19 at the end of 2020, and was largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2020 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this metric was 8.0%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2019 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this metric was 7.4%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2018 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2018.We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation supports the reasonableness of our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims and the consistency in our methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2021, this metric was 2%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $1,703. This metric was 0.8% for 2020 and 0.7% for 2019. We believe these metrics support the reasonableness of our estimates. The 2021 metric was impacted by the estimation uncertainty due to COVID-19.-56-The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for each of 2020 and 2019 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims – current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims – prior years redundancies” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 20202019Total net incurred medical claims, as reported$84,457 $78,195 Retrospective basis, as described above83,391 78,058 Variance$1,066 $137 Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported1.3 %0.2 %Given that our business is primarily short tailed (which means that medical claims are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider), the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2021 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2022.The 2020 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of 1.3% was greater than the 2019 percentage of 0.2%. This was driven by the fact that the change in the prior year redundancy reported for 2020 as compared to 2019 was greater than the change in the prior year redundancy reported for 2019 as compared to 2018.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance, which requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance.At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following:•the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset;•the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim;•the tax rate at which the deferred tax assets will likely be utilized in the future;•the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and•any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences.We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits, as required by the applicable guidance. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted.In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law, and we intend to defend our positions vigorously through the federal, state and local appeals processes. We believe we have adequately -57-provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact on our results of operations or financial condition from these matters.For additional information, see Note 8, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsOur consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2021 was $24,228 and other intangible assets were $10,615. The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets represented 35.8% of our total consolidated assets and 96.6% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021.We follow FASB guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, which include goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately.We complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. These tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Certain interim impairment tests are also performed when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, which is an indication that our goodwill may be impaired. These qualitative impairment tests include assessing events and factors that could affect the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our procedures include assessing our financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, various asset specific factors and entity specific events. If we determine that a reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired after utilizing these qualitative impairment analysis procedures, we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test.Our quantitative impairment test utilizes the projected income and market valuation approaches for goodwill and the projected income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. Use of the projected income and market valuation approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. The projected income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. These estimated future cash flows are then discounted. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted-average cost of capital. Market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including revenue; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; and book value of invested capital (debt and equity) and include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry.We did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2021 annual impairment tests, as it was determined that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying values as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, we do not believe that the estimated fair values of our reporting units are at risk of becoming impaired in the next twelve months. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.For additional information, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions” and Note 10, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. -58-InvestmentsCurrent and long-term marketable investment securities were $28,780 at December 31, 2021 and represented 29.5% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2021. We classify fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” and report those securities at fair value. Certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity.Our impairment review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors. Such factors considered include the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. Prior to 2020, our fixed maturity securities were evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment where credit-related impairments were presented within the other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income with an adjustment to the security’s amortized cost basis. Effective January 1, 2020, if a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we write down the fixed maturity security’s cost basis to fair value and record an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, we recognize the credit component of the impairment as an allowance for credit loss in our consolidated balance sheets and record an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. The non-credit component of the impairment is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit-related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The credit component of an impairment is determined primarily by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of purchase. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral, including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default.We have a committee of accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. We believe that we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. We have established an allowance for credit loss and recorded credit loss expense as a reflection of our expected impairment losses. Given the inherent uncertainty of changes in market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional impairment losses on investments may be recorded in future periods. In addition to marketable investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $5,225, or 5.4% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2021. These long-term investments consisted primarily of certain other equity investments, the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies, mortgage loans and real estate. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term.Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits on investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future results of operations and financial condition. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $26,899 at December 31, 2021. The weighted-average credit rating of these securities was “A” -59-as of December 31, 2021. Included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions of $1,095 that are guaranteed by third parties. With the exception of nineteen securities with a fair value of $27, these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2021. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors, and we do not have any material exposure to any single guarantor, neither indirectly through the guarantees, nor directly through investment in the guarantor. Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of the fixed maturity securities without a guarantee, for which such information is available, was “A” as of December 31, 2021.Fair values of fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third-party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with FASB guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. We have controls in place to review the pricing services’ qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. In addition, we periodically review the pricing services’ pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable.We obtain quoted market prices for each security from the pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in these valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform analysis on the prices received from the pricing services to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes procedures such as a review of month-to-month price fluctuations and price comparisons to secondary pricing services. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from the pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.In certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. Such securities are designated Level III in accordance with FASB guidance. Securities designated Level III at December 31, 2021 totaled $449 and represented approximately 1.3% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level III securities primarily consisted of certain corporate securities and equity securities for which observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields.For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” and Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” Note 5, “Investments,” and Note 7, “Fair Value,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Retirement BenefitsPension BenefitsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for some of our employees. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FASB guidance for retirement benefits, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by the guidance, we calculate the value of plan assets as described below. Further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods. An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our December 31, 2021 measurement date, we selected a weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.02%. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and an average of historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase.-60-This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. We apply a corridor approach to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. Under this approach, only accumulated net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the average remaining service or lifetime of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date. We use the annual spot rate approach for setting our discount rate. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot rates from a full yield curve of published rates are used to discount each plan’s cash flows to determine the plan’s obligation. At the December 31, 2021 measurement date, the weighted-average discount rate under the annual spot rate approach was 2.70%, compared to 2.24% at the December 31, 2020 measurement date. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FASB guidance.In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of equity securities, investment grade fixed maturity securities and other types of investments across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow.Other Postretirement BenefitsWe provide some associates with certain medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate and the expected trend in healthcare costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits.At our December 31, 2021 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 2.49%, compared to a discount rate of 1.99% at the December 31, 2020 measurement rate. We developed this rate using the annual spot rate approach as described above. The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of pre-Medicare (those who are not currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2021 measurement date was 7.00% for 2022 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2033. The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of post-Medicare (those who are currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2021 measurement date was 5.50% for 2022 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2033. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future.For additional information regarding our retirement benefits, see Note 11, “Retirement Benefits,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.New Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended December 31, 2021 that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures, see the “Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance” and “Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted” sections of Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesIntroductionOur cash receipts result primarily from premiums, product revenue, administrative fees and other revenue, investment income, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, -61-administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity.We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy.A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations.The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. The securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility, although current market conditions are more stable. Interest rates on fixed income securities are expected to rise in 2022, which could increase our borrowing costs if we elect to issue debt. During recent years, the federal government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. In addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide stability and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions. Further, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government has established a number of programs to provide liquidity to the financial system that provides lending to states, municipalities, and eligible businesses. A summary of our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows: Years Ended December 31$ Change 2021202020192021 vs. 20202020 vs. 2019Sources of Cash:Net cash provided by operating activities$8,364 $10,688 $6,061 $(2,324)$4,627 Issuances of commercial paper and short- and long-term debt, net of repayments2,719 — 608 2,719 (608)Issuances of common stock under employee stock plans203 176 187 27 (11)Other sources of cash, net— 315 — (315)315 Total sources of cash11,286 11,179 6,856 107 4,323 Uses of Cash:Purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales, maturities, calls and redemptions(4,056)(3,433)(1,919)(623)(1,514)Repurchase and retirement of common stock(1,900)(2,700)(1,701)800 (999)Purchases of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired(3,476)(1,976)— (1,500)(1,976)Purchases of property and equipment(1,087)(1,021)(1,077)(66)56 Repayments of commercial paper and short- and long-term debt, net of issuances— (298)— 298 (298)Cash dividends(1,104)(954)(818)(150)(136)Other uses of cash, net(514)— (338)(514)338 Total uses of cash(12,137)(10,382)(5,853)(1,755)(4,529)Effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(10)7 — (17)7 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents$(861)$804 $1,003 $(1,665)$(199)-62-Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the impact of working capital changes year-over-year, including an increase in receivables and a decline in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by higher net income in 2021.Other significant changes in sources and uses of cash year-over-year included an increase in net proceeds received from the issuance of commercial paper and short-term and long-term debt, net of repayments and reduced amounts for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for the purchases of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired.Financial ConditionWe maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities of $33,660 at December 31, 2021. Since December 31, 2020, total cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $2,365, primarily due to cash generated from operations. This increase was partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, common stock repurchases, purchases of property and equipment and cash dividends paid to shareholders.Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Certain accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities, or statutory accounting practices, differ from GAAP. Changes that occur in statutory accounting practices, if any, could impact our subsidiaries’ future dividend capacity. In addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries.At December 31, 2021, we held $1,194 of cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company, which are available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, potential future common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders, repurchases of debt securities and debt and interest payments. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue debt (“Notes”) for long-term borrowing purposes, for example, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. Certain of these Notes may have a call feature that allows us to redeem the Notes at any time at our option and/or a put feature that allows a Note holder to redeem the Notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating. For more information on our debt, including redemptions and issuances, see Note 13, “Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We calculate our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, a non-GAAP measure, from the amounts presented on our audited consolidated balance sheets included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total debt plus total shareholders’ equity. Total debt is the sum of short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt, less current portion. We believe our debt-to-capital ratio assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. In addition, our bank covenants include a maximum debt-to-capital ratio that we cannot and did not exceed. Our debt-to-capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio was 38.9% and 37.6% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Our senior debt is rated “A” by S&P Global, “BBB” by Fitch Ratings, Inc., “Baa2” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by limitations on future borrowings and a potential increase in our borrowing costs.Capital ResourcesWe have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, -63-including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries and the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansions.We have a senior revolving credit facility (the “5-Year Facility”) available in the amount of $2,500 with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. On June 3, 2021, we terminated our 364-day senior revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in June 2021 (the “prior 364-Day Facility”), and entered into a new 364-day senior revolving credit facility (the “new 364-Day Facility” and together with the 5-Year Facility, the “Credit Facilities”) with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. The new 364-Day Facility provides for credit in the amount of $1,000 and matures in June 2022. Our ability to borrow under these Credit Facilities is subject to compliance with certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt-to-capital ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. We do not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect our financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. There were no amounts outstanding under the 5-Year Facility or the new 364-Day Facility at December 31, 2021.Through certain subsidiaries, we have entered into multiple 364-day lines of credit (the “Subsidiary Credit Facilities”) with separate lenders for general corporate purposes. The Subsidiary Credit Facilities provide combined credit up to $200. Our ability to borrow under the Subsidiary Credit Facilities is subject to compliance with certain covenants. At December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Subsidiary Credit Facilities.We have a $3,500 commercial paper program, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we have the ability to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our Credit Facilities, which provide for combined credit in the amount of $3,500, to redeem any outstanding commercial paper upon maturity. While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we believe the lenders participating in our credit facilities, if market conditions allow, would be willing to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. At December 31, 2021, we had $300 outstanding under our commercial paper program.We are a member, through certain subsidiaries, of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, collectively (the “FHLBs”). As a member, we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. At December 31, 2021, we had $275 outstanding short-term borrowings from the FHLBs.As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we currently estimate that approximately $3,000 of dividends will be paid to the parent company during 2022. During 2021, we received $3,134 of dividends from our subsidiaries.In addition to regulations regarding the timing and amount of dividends, our regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for health and other insurance companies and HMOs largely based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) Risk-Based Capital (RBC) For Health Organizations Model Act (“RBC Model Act”). These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under the RBC Model Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our regulated subsidiaries’ respective RBC levels as of December 31, 2021, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, were in excess of all applicable mandatory RBC requirements. In addition to exceeding these RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries. For additional information, see Note 22, “Statutory Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.-64-Future Sources and Uses of LiquidityShort-Term Liquidity RequirementsAs previously described, our cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. We believe cash on hand, operating cash receipts, investments and amounts available under our commercial paper and Credit Facilities will be adequate to fund our expected cash disbursements over the next twelve months.Long-Term Liquidity RequirementsAs of December 31, 2021, our long-term cash disbursements required under various contractual obligations and commitments were:•Debt and interest expense: Future debt and estimated interest payments were $24,412, with $2,935 due within the next twelve months. For additional information, see Note 13 “Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.•Operating leases: We lease office space and certain computer equipment, for which the future estimated payments were $1,092, with $211 due within the next twelve months. For additional information, see Note 18 “Leases” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.•Other liabilities: These liabilities primarily consist of future policy reserves, projected other postretirement benefits, deferred compensation, supplemental executive retirement plan liabilities and certain other miscellaneous long-term obligations. Amounts due within twelve months were $29, with $1,233 due in future periods. Estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from these numbers, as we had no funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, at December 31, 2021, as a result of the value of the assets in the plans. In addition, gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions and interest for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities have not been included. For further information, see Note 8, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.•Purchase obligations: These obligations include estimated payments for future services under contractual arrangements from third-party service vendors. Amounts due within the next twelve months for these purchase obligations were $886, while longer term payments were $5,048. For further information, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.•Investment commitments: These include unfunded capital commitments for alternative investments and low-income housing tax credits. Estimated amounts due were $1,558, including $249 due within the next twelve months. In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. We regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions, common stock and debt security repurchases and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. On January 25, 2022, our Audit Committee declared a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $1.28 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on March 25, 2022 to the shareholders of record as of March 10, 2022.Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. On January 26, 2021, our Audit Committee, pursuant to authorization granted by the Board of Directors, authorized a $5,000 increase to our common stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2021, we had Board authorization of $4,192 to repurchase our common stock. -65-We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our senior revolving credit facilities and/or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions.We do not have any off-balance sheet derivative instruments, guarantee transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements or any indemnification agreements that will require funding in future periods. We have not transferred assets to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not hold any variable interest in an unconsolidated entity where such entity provides us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. See Note 2 “Subsidiary Transactions” of the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements included in Part III, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional detail on the Anthem, Inc. parent guarantees of certain subsidiaries.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. (In Millions, Except As Otherwise Stated Herein)As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2021. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return.InvestmentsOur investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk.The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit event, such as a ratings downgrade or default, to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that event. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately “A.” Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which have exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value.Investments in fixed maturity securities include corporate securities, which account for 46.0% of our total fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2021 and are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase, prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. We manage this risk through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of our corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately “BBB.”Market risk for fixed maturity securities is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $1,114 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $1,152 increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and the duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly.Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities, exchange-traded funds and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, -66-driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systemic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio.Our other invested assets, reported within our long-term investments, are primarily subject to private market exposures, including private equity, real estate, and private credit investments. These investments are also indirectly subject to market valuation risk, as public market valuations will form a basis for valuations for these investments. Given their illiquid nature, we focus on appropriate sizing of these investments relative to our liquidity needs and risk tolerance. Our risk tolerance is formed by the level of illiquidity and short-term price movements from market valuation risk we are willing to accept relative to the higher long-term expected returns over the life of these investments.As of December 31, 2021, 6.5% of our marketable investments were equity securities. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $188. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $188.For additional information regarding our investments, see Note 5, “Investments,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Investments” within Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Long-Term DebtOur total long-term debt at December 31, 2021 consisted of senior unsecured notes, convertible debentures, commercial paper and subordinated surplus notes issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $22,756 and $26,136, respectively. This debt is subject to interest rate risk, as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. For additional information regarding our long-term debt, see Note 7, “Fair Value” and Note 13, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Derivatives We have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts, which are used to lock-in interest rates or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. We have used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities.Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these derivatives. As of December 31, 2021, we recorded a net asset of $18, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swaps’ fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $32 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $32 increase in fair value.For additional information regarding our derivatives, see Note 6, “Derivative Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. -67-",2023-12-30 18:52:30.232566
1156039,ELV,"Elevance Health, Inc.",2023,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein)On May 18, 2022, our shareholders approved a proposal to amend our amended and restated articles of incorporation to change our name from Anthem, Inc. to Elevance Health, Inc. This amendment and name change went into effect on June 27, 2022. We began operating as Elevance Health, Inc. and trading under our new ticker symbol “ELV” on June 28, 2022. References to the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Elevance Health” or the “Company” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) refer to Elevance Health, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and, unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries. References to the “states” include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, unless the context otherwise requires. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. A detailed discussion of 2020 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. OverviewElevance Health is a health company with the purpose of improving the health of humanity. We are one of the largest health insurers in the United States in terms of medical membership, serving approximately 47.5 million medical members through our affiliated health plans as of December 31, 2022. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (“BCBSA”), an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield (“BCBS”) licensee for Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (in the New York City metropolitan area and upstate New York), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas, we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield or Empire Blue Cross. In addition, we conduct business through arrangements with other BCBS licensees as well as other strategic partners. Through our subsidiaries, we also serve customers in numerous states across the country as AIM Specialty Health, Amerigroup, Aspire Health, Beacon, CareMore, Freedom Health, HealthLink, HealthSun, MMM, Optimum Healthcare, Simply Healthcare, Unicare and/or Wellpoint. We offer pharmacy benefits management (“PBM”) services through our CarelonRx, Inc. (“CarelonRx”) subsidiary, which was known as IngenioRx, Inc. prior to January 1, 2023. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico through our subsidiaries. As part of our name change to Elevance Health, in June 2022, we announced that over the next several years we will organize our brand portfolio into the following core go-to-market brands:•Anthem Blue Cross/Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield — represents our existing Anthem-branded and affiliated Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensed plans;•Wellpoint — we intend to unite select non-BCBSA licensed Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial plans under the Wellpoint name; and•Carelon — this brand brings together our healthcare-related services and capabilities, including our formerly named Diversified Business Group and IngenioRx businesses, under a single brand name.In 2022, we managed our operations by customer type through four reportable segments: Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, CarelonRx (formerly known as IngenioRx) and Other. As we continue our journey to evolve our business from a traditional health insurance company into a lifetime, trusted health partner, we are evaluating and making changes to how we manage our business. This included a review of the products in each of our operating segments, which resulted in restructurings between some of our operating segments. Therefore, our reportable segment presentation in 2023 -39-and its composition will reflect how we began managing our operations and monitoring performance, aligning strategies and allocating resources on January 1, 2023. As a result of these changes, beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2023, we will report our results in the following four reportable segments: (i) Health Benefits, which will combine our existing Commercial & Specialty Business and Government Business segments; (ii) our existing CarelonRx segment; (iii) Carelon Services (our former Diversified Business Group), which will be carved out from our existing Other segment; and (iv) Corporate and Other, which will include businesses that do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment, as well as corporate expenses not allocated to our other reportable segments. We expect to reclassify previously reported information to conform to the new presentation.Our results of operations discussed throughout this MD&A are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We also calculate operating gain and operating margin to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expense. Operating margin is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definition of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We use these measures as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, forecasting future operating periods and setting incentive compensation targets. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income before income tax expense, net income or fully-diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) prepared in accordance with GAAP. For additional details on operating gain, see our “Reportable Segments Results of Operations” discussion included in this MD&A. For a reconciliation of reportable segment operating revenue to the amounts of total revenue included in the consolidated statements of income and a reconciliation of reportable segment operating gain to income before income tax expense, see Note 20, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our operating revenue consists of premiums, product revenue, and administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue is generated from risk-based contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life insurance benefits. Product revenue represents services performed by CarelonRx for unaffiliated PBM customers and includes ingredient costs (net of any rebates or discounts), including co-payments made by or on behalf of the customer, and administrative fees. Unaffiliated PBM customers include our fee-based groups that contract with CarelonRx for PBM services and external customers outside of the health plans we own. Administrative fees and other revenue come from fees from our fee-based customers for the processing of transactions or network discount savings realized, revenues from our Medicare processing business and revenues from other health-related businesses, including care management programs and miscellaneous other income. Our benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our risk-based members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. While we offer a diversified mix of managed care products and services through our managed care plans, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products and services. Our managed care plans include: Preferred Provider Organizations; Health Maintenance Organizations; Point-of-Service plans; traditional indemnity plans and other hybrid plans, including Consumer-Driven Health Plans; and hospital only and limited benefit products. We classify certain quality improvement costs as benefit expense. Quality improvement activities are those designed to improve member health outcomes, prevent hospital readmissions and improve patient safety. They also include expenses for wellness and health promotion provided to our members. These quality improvement costs may be comprised of expenses incurred for: (i) medical management, including care coordination and case management; (ii) health and wellness, including disease management services for such conditions as diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, congestive heart failure and asthma management and wellness initiatives like weight-loss programs and smoking cessation treatments; and (iii) clinical health policy, such as identification and use of best clinical practices to avoid harm, identifying clinical errors and safety concerns, and identifying potential adverse drug interactions. -40-Our cost of products sold represents the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed by CarelonRx for our unaffiliated PBM customers (net of rebates or discounts), including any co-payments made by or on behalf of the customer, per-claim administrative fees for prescription fulfillment and certain direct costs related to sales and administration of customer contracts.Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Commission expense generally varies with premium or membership volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels and thus, associated compensation expense. Other variable costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity.Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage healthcare costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members, product pricing, medical management and health and wellness programs, innovative product design and our ability to maintain or achieve improvement in our Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Star ratings. Several economic factors related to healthcare costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating healthcare costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers and any regulatory or market-driven restrictions on our ability to obtain adequate premium rates to offset overall inflation in healthcare costs, including increases in unit costs and utilization resulting from the aging of the population and other demographics, the impact of epidemics and pandemics, as well as advances in medical technology, may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.We intend to expand through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and efficient use of capital in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale, as well as provide us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. We use our subsidiary CarelonRx (formerly IngenioRx) to market and offer PBM services, and we expect CarelonRx to continue to improve our ability to integrate pharmacy benefits within our medical and specialty platform. We continued growing our government-sponsored business through organic growth and the acquisitions of MMM Holdings, LLC (“MMM”) in 2021 and Integra MLTC, Inc. (“Integra”) in 2022. In all other markets, we intend to maintain our position by delivering excellent service, offering competitively priced products, providing access to high-quality provider networks and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks. For additional information about our business and reportable segments, see Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Note 20, “Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, putting pressure on the healthcare system, and it has impacted, and may continue to impact, our membership, benefit expense and member behavior. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic as well as resulting legislative and regulatory changes to manage our response and assess and mitigate potential adverse impacts to our business. For additional discussion regarding the impact of and our risks and trends related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Business Trends” and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Business TrendsIn 2022, we made the decision to modestly expand our participation in the Individual state- or federally-facilitated marketplaces (the “Public Exchange”) for 2023 after also expanding in 2022. As a result, for 2023 we are offering Individual Public Exchange products in 138 of the 143 rating regions in which we operate, in comparison to 122 of 143 rating regions in 2022. Our strategy has been, and will continue to be, to only participate in rating regions where we have an appropriate level -41-of confidence that these markets are on a path toward sustainability, including, but not limited to, factors such as expected financial performance, regulatory environment and underlying market characteristics. Changes to our business environment are likely to continue as elected officials at the national and state levels continue to enact, and both elected officials and candidates for election continue to propose, significant modifications to existing laws and regulations, including changes to taxes and fees. In addition, the continuing growth in our government-sponsored business exposes us to increased regulatory oversight.Our CarelonRx subsidiary markets and offers PBM services to our affiliated health plan customers throughout the country, as well as to customers outside of the health plans we own. Our comprehensive PBM services portfolio includes features such as formulary management, pharmacy networks, a prescription drug database, member services and mail order capabilities. CarelonRx delegates certain PBM administrative functions, such as claims processing and prescription fulfillment, to CaremarkPCS Health, L.L.C., which is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corporation, pursuant to a five-year agreement that is set to terminate on December 31, 2024. With CarelonRx, we retain the responsibilities for clinical and formulary strategy and development, member and employer experiences, operations, sales, marketing, account management and retail network strategy. Pricing Trends: We strive to price our health benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical cost trends. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic (including new COVID-19 variants, which may be more contagious or severe, or less responsive to treatment or vaccines) and the impacts it may have on our pricing, such as surges in COVID-19 related hospitalizations, infection rates, the cost of COVID-19 vaccines, testing and treatment and the return of non-COVID-19 healthcare utilization to our estimate of normal levels, based on historical utilization patterns. We frequently make adjustments to respond to legislative and regulatory changes as well as pricing and other actions taken by existing competitors and new market entrants. Product pricing in our Commercial & Specialty Business segment remains competitive. Revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government and/or applicable state governments. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) imposed an annual Health Insurance Provider Fee (“HIP Fee”) on health insurers that write certain types of health insurance on U.S. risks. We priced our affected products to cover the impact of the HIP Fee when it was in effect. The HIP Fee was in effect for 2020 but was permanently repealed beginning in 2021.Medical Cost Trends: Our medical cost trends are primarily driven by increases in the utilization of services across all provider types and the unit cost increases of these services. We work to mitigate these trends through various medical management programs such as care and condition management, program integrity and specialty pharmacy management and utilization management, as well as benefit design changes. There are many drivers of medical cost trends that can cause variance from our estimates, such as changes in the level and mix of services utilized, regulatory changes, aging of the population, health status and other demographic characteristics of our members, epidemics, pandemics, advances in medical technology, new high cost prescription drugs, provider contracting inflation, labor costs and healthcare provider or member fraud.At its onset, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a decrease in utilization of non-COVID-19 health services, which decreased our claim costs in 2020. As the pandemic continued through 2021, our non-COVID-19 healthcare utilization experience gradually increased and largely normalized, and our COVID-19 related healthcare expenses increased as new variants (Delta and Omicron) emerged and vaccinations and boosters became available.The Omicron variant increased confirmed COVID-19 cases to significant levels at the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022. The COVID-19 surge quickly declined during the first quarter of 2022, with COVID-19 inpatient hospitalizations, provider-based tests, visits and vaccinations all decreasing to lower levels by the end of the first half of 2022; concurrently, non-COVID-19 healthcare utilization recovered from lower levels earlier in the year. Omicron sub-variant viruses as well as costs associated with updated bivalent vaccinations drove modest increases in COVID-19 related healthcare expenses in the second half of 2022, but the expected paid claims impact for the second half of 2022 are significantly lower than the winter surge experienced in each of the prior two years. The ongoing cost and volume of covered services related to the COVID-19 pandemic and a future shift of government supplied vaccinations and treatments to privatized, full cost price points may have an adverse effect on our future claim costs. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our medical cost trends. For additional discussion regarding business trends, see Part I, Item 1, “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.-42-Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesWith the declaration of COVID-19 as a public health emergency (“PHE”), the federal and state governments enacted, and may continue to enact, legislation and regulations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that have had, and we expect will continue to have, a significant impact on health benefits, consumer eligibility for public programs and our cash flows for all of our lines of business and which have introduced increased uncertainty around our cost structure. These actions, which are or have been in effect for various durations, provide, among other things: mandates to waive cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing, vaccines and related services; financial support to healthcare providers; and mandates related to prior authorizations, payment levels to providers, consumer enrollment windows and telehealth services. The Biden administration renewed the PHE on January 11, 2023 and has indicated that they intend for the PHE to expire on May 11, 2023.Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (the “2023 Appropriations Act”), Congress decoupled Medicaid eligibility recertification from the PHE. As a result, states may begin removing ineligible beneficiaries from their Medicaid programs starting April 1, 2023. When recertifications resume, we expect a decline in our Medicaid membership. At the same time, we expect growth in our Commercial risk-based and fee-based plans and Medicare, including through the Public Exchanges, as members exiting Medicaid in our 14 Commercial states seek coverage elsewhere.The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was signed into law in August 2022, contains a variety of provisions that impact our business including an extension of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021's enhanced Premium Tax Credits (“PTC”) through 2025; imposing a new corporate alternative minimum tax; providing a one percent excise tax on repurchases of stock made after December 31, 2022; allowing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to negotiate prices on a limited set of prescription drugs in Medicare Parts B and D beginning in 2026; instituting caps on insulin cost sharing in Medicare Parts B and D; redesigning of the Medicare Part D benefit; adding a requirement that drug manufacturers pay rebates if prices increase beyond inflation; and delaying the implementation of the Trump Administration Medicare drug rebate rule to 2032. The extension of the enhanced PTC will likely allow for growth in Individual exchange market enrollment as Medicaid eligibility recertifications resume, supporting continuity of coverage for more people.The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the “2021 Appropriations Act”) has impacted and in the future may have a material effect upon our business, including procedures and coverage requirements related to surprise medical bills and new mandates for continuity of care for certain patients, price comparison tools, disclosure of broker compensation, mental health parity reporting and reporting on pharmacy benefits and drug costs. The requirements of the 2021 Appropriations Act applicable to us have varying effective dates, some of which were effective in December 2021 and during 2022, and others of which have been extended into 2023 since the enactment of the 2021 Appropriations Act. The health plan price transparency regulations issued in October 2020 by the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and Treasury required us to begin disclosing in July 2022, on a monthly basis, detailed pricing information regarding negotiated rates for all covered items and services between the plan or issuer and in-network providers and historical payments to, and billed charges from, out-of-network providers. Additionally, beginning in 2023, we are now required to make available to members personalized out-of-pocket cost information and the underlying negotiated rates for 500 covered healthcare items and services, including prescription drugs. In 2024, this requirement will expand to all items and services.Since its enactment in 2010, the ACA has introduced new risks, regulatory challenges and uncertainties, has impacted our business model and strategy and has required changes in the way our products are designed, underwritten, priced, distributed and administered. We expect the ACA will continue to significantly impact our business and results of operations, including pricing, minimum medical loss ratios and the geographies in which our products are available. We also expect further and ongoing regulatory guidance on a number of issues related to Medicare, including evolving methodology for ratings and quality bonus payments. CMS also frequently proposes changes to its program that audits data submitted under the risk adjustment programs in ways that could increase financial recoveries from plans. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the ACA as any further developments occur.For additional discussion regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, and risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, see Part I, Item 1, “Business — Regulation” and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”-43-Other Significant ItemsBusiness and Operational MattersAs mentioned above, we began operating as Elevance Health on June 28, 2022. This name change is intended to better reflect our business and our journey from a traditional health benefits organization to a lifetime, trusted health partner. Elevance Health supports health at every stage, offering health plans and clinical, behavioral, pharmacy and complex-care solutions that promote whole health.On January 23, 2023, we announced our entrance into an agreement to acquire Louisiana Health Service & Indemnity Company, d/b/a Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, an independent licensee of the BCBSA that provides healthcare plans to the Individual, Group, Medicaid and Medicare markets, primarily in the State of Louisiana. This acquisition aligns with our vision to be an innovative, valuable, and inclusive healthcare partner by providing care management programs that improve the lives of the people we serve. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 and is subject to standard closing conditions and customary approvals.On November 9, 2022, we announced our entrance into an agreement with CarepathRx Aggregator, LLC to acquire its specialty pharmacy division, which includes BioPlus Parent, LLC (“BioPlus”) and subsidiaries. BioPlus is one of the largest independent specialty pharmacy organizations in the United States and seeks to connect payors and providers of specialty pharmaceuticals to meet the medication therapy needs of patients with complex medical conditions. This acquisition aligns with our vision to be an innovative, valuable and inclusive healthcare partner by providing care management programs that improve the lives of the people we serve. The acquisition closed on February 15, 2023, and initial purchase accounting has not been finalized.On May 5, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Integra. Integra is a managed long-term care plan that serves New York state Medicaid members, enabling adults with long-term care needs and disabilities to live safely and independently in their own homes.On June 29, 2021, we completed our acquisition of MMM, including its Medicare Advantage plan, Medicaid plan and other affiliated companies. MMM is a Puerto Rico-based integrated healthcare organization and seeks to provide its Medicare Advantage and Medicaid members with a whole health experience through its network of specialized clinics and wholly owned independent physician associations. This acquisition aligns with our vision to be an innovative, valuable and inclusive healthcare partner by providing care management programs that improve the lives of the people we serve.On April 28, 2021, we completed our acquisition of myNEXUS, Inc. (“myNEXUS”). myNEXUS is a comprehensive home-based nursing management company for payors and, at the time of acquisition, delivered integrated clinical support services for Medicare Advantage members across twenty states. This acquisition aligns with our strategy to manage integrated, whole person multi-site care and support by providing national, large-scale expertise to manage nursing services in the home and facilitate transitions of care. For additional information, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In 2020, we introduced enterprise-wide initiatives to optimize our business and as a result, recorded a charge of $653 in selling, general and administrative expenses. We believe these initiatives largely represent the next step forward in our progression towards becoming a more agile organization, including process automation and a reduction in our office space footprint. In the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021, we identified additional office space reductions and related fixed asset impairments due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and recorded net charges of $39 and $202, respectively, in selling, general and administrative expenses. For additional information, see Note 4, “Business Optimization Initiatives” and Note 18, “Leases,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Litigation Matters In the consolidated multi-district proceeding in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama (the “Court”) captioned In re Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation (“BCBSA Litigation”), the BCBSA and Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensees, including us (the “Blue plans”) previously approved a settlement agreement and release with the -44-plaintiffs representing a putative nationwide class of health plan subscribers (the “Subscriber Settlement Agreement”), which agreement required the Court’s approval to become effective. Generally, the lawsuits in the BCBSA Litigation challenge elements of the licensing agreements between the BCBSA and the independently owned and operated Blue plans. The cases were brought by two putative nationwide classes of plaintiffs, health plan subscribers and providers. The Subscriber Settlement Agreement applies only to the subscriber class. The defendants continue to contest the consolidated cases brought by the provider plaintiffs.In August 2022, the Court issued a final order approving the Subscriber Settlement Agreement (the “Final Approval Order”). In compliance with the Subscriber Settlement Agreement, the Company paid $506 into an escrow account in September 2022, for an aggregate and full settlement payment by the Company of $596, which was previously accrued in 2020. Four notices of appeal of the Final Approval Order were filed by the September 2022 appeal deadline. Those appeals are proceeding in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In the event all appellate rights are exhausted in a manner that affirms the Court’s Final Approval Order, the defendants’ payment and non-monetary obligations under the Subscriber Settlement Agreement will become effective and the funds held in escrow will be distributed in accordance with the Subscriber Settlement Agreement. For additional information regarding the BCBSA Litigation, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies – Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings – Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Selected Operating PerformanceDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, total medical membership increased by 2.2 million, or 4.8%. The increase in medical membership was driven primarily by organic growth in our Government Business segment primarily driven by the continued temporary suspension of Medicaid eligibility recertification during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as organic growth in our Commercial & Specialty Business segment, and in particular in our Group fee-based membership.Operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $155,660, an increase of $18,717, or 13.7%, from the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in operating revenue was primarily driven by higher premium revenue in our Medicaid business due to organic membership growth from the continued temporary suspension of Medicaid eligibility recertification during the COVID-19 pandemic, the acquisition of Integra in the second quarter of 2022 and the acquisition of Ohio Medicaid members through the purchase of a Medicaid contract in the first quarter of 2022. Membership growth in our Medicare Advantage and Commercial & Specialty Business risk-based businesses, as well as premium rate increases to cover medical cost trends, also generated higher premium revenue. Finally, the increase in operating revenue was further attributable to increased pharmacy product revenue in our CarelonRx segment, resulting from growth in membership and higher script volume. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $6,019, a decrease of $76, or 1.2%, from the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net income was primarily due to realized losses on financial instruments in 2022, as compared to gains in 2021, and increased intangible amortization in 2022 related to recent acquisitions and the rebranding of our products, as we expect to retire certain trade names in the future. These items were partially offset by operating gain increases in all of our business segments.Our fully-diluted shareholders' earnings per share (“EPS”) for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $24.81, an increase of $0.08, or 0.3%, from the year ended December 31, 2021. Our diluted shares for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 242.8, a decrease of 4.0, or 1.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in EPS resulted from lower average shares outstanding in 2022, partially offset by the decrease in net income.Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $8,399, or approximately 1.4 times net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $8,364, or approximately 1.4 times net income. The slight increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher net income in 2022, when adjusted for the impact of investment losses and gains, partially offset by the timing of working capital changes and the payment pursuant to the Subscriber Settlement Agreement made in September 2022.-45-Membership Our medical membership includes the following customer types: Individual, Group risk-based, Group fee-based, BlueCard®, Medicare, Medicaid and our Federal Employees Health Benefits (“FEHB”) Program. We refer to members in our service areas licensed by the BCBSA as our BCBS-branded, or Anthem BCBS, business. Non-BCBS-branded business refers to members in our non-BCBS-branded, or Wellpoint plans, which include Amerigroup, Freedom Health, HealthSun, MMM, Optimum Healthcare and Simply Healthcare plans, as well as HealthLink and UniCare members. In addition to the above medical membership, we also serve customers who purchase one or more of our other products or services that are often ancillary to our health business.•Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. Individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, retail partnerships, our in-house sales force or via the Public Exchanges. Individual business is sold on a risk-based basis. We offer on-exchange products through Public Exchanges and off-exchange products. Federal premium subsidies are available only for certain Public Exchange Individual products. Unsubsidized Individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network and the efficiency of administration. Customer turnover is generally higher with Individual as compared to Group risk-based. Individual business accounted for 1.7%, 1.7% and 1.6% of our medical members at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.•Group risk-based consists of employer customers who purchase products on a full-risk basis, which are products for which we charge a premium and indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Group risk-based accounts include Local Group customers and National Accounts. Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. In addition, Local Group includes Student Health members. National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in an Elevance Health service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker and consultant relationships. Group risk-based accounts are generally sold through brokers or consultants who work with industry specialists from our in-house sales force and are offered both on and off the Public Exchanges. Group risk-based accounted for 8.4%, 8.8% and 8.9% of our medical members at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.•Group fee-based customers represent employer groups, Local Group, including UniCare members, and National Accounts, who purchase fee-based products and elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ healthcare costs. Some fee-based customers choose to purchase stop loss coverage to limit their retained risk. Group fee-based accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. Group fee-based accounted for 42.4%, 42.7% and 45.5% of our medical members at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.•BlueCard® host customers represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by Elevance Health who receive healthcare services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard® membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard® program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which an Elevance Health subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-Elevance Health controlled BCBSA licensee (the “home plan”). We perform certain functions, including claims pricing and administration, for BlueCard® members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard® members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard® claims received per month. BlueCard® host membership accounted for 13.6%, 13.6% and 14.1% of our medical members at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.•Medicare customers are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, including Special Needs Plans (“SNPs”), also known as Medicare Advantage SNPs; dual-eligible programs through Medicare-Medicaid Plans (“MMPs”); Medicare Supplement plans; and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans (“Medicare Part D”). Medicare Advantage plans provide Medicare beneficiaries with a managed care alternative to traditional Medicare and often include a Medicare Part D benefit. In addition, our -46-Medicare Advantage SNPs provide tailored benefits to special needs individuals who are institutionalized or have severe or disabling chronic conditions and to dual-eligible customers, who are low-income seniors and persons under age 65 with disabilities. Medicare Advantage SNPs are coordinated care plans specifically designed to provide targeted care, covering all the healthcare services considered medically necessary for members and often providing professional care coordination services, with personal guidance and programs that help members maintain their health. Medicare Advantage membership also includes Medicare Advantage members in our Group Retiree Solutions business who are retired members of Commercial accounts or retired members of groups who are not affiliated with our Commercial accounts who have selected a Medicare Advantage product through us. Medicare Supplement plans typically pay the difference between healthcare costs incurred by a beneficiary and amounts paid by Medicare. Medicare Part D offers a prescription drug plan to Medicare and MMP beneficiaries. MMP, which was established as a result of the passage of the ACA, is a demonstration program focused on serving members who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. Medicare program business accounted for 6.2%, 6.2% and 5.5% of our medical members at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.•Medicaid membership represents eligible members who receive health benefits through publicly funded healthcare programs, including Medicaid, ACA-related Medicaid expansion programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, programs for seniors and people with disabilities, Children’s Health Insurance Programs, and specialty programs such as those focused on long-term services and support, HIV/AIDS, foster care, behavioral health and/or substance abuse disorders, and intellectual disabilities or developmental disabilities, among others. Total Medicaid program business accounted for 24.3%, 23.4% and 20.6% of our medical members at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.•FEHB members consist of United States government employees and their dependents who receive health benefits within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. FEHB business accounted for 3.4%, 3.6% and 3.8% of our medical members at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.-47-The following table presents our medical membership by reportable segment and customer type as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Also included below is other membership by product. The medical membership and other membership presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

Our Government Business segment’s organic growth was primarily driven by the continued temporary suspension of Medicaid eligibility recertification during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, Medicaid membership was positively impacted by the acquisition of Ohio Medicaid members through the purchase of a Medicaid contract in the first quarter of 2022 and the acquisition of Integra in the second quarter of 2022. Medicare Advantage organic growth due to sales exceeding lapses also contributed to the overall Government Business segment growth. Our Commercial & Specialty Business segment growth included Group fee-based membership increases due to sales exceeding lapses and positive in-group changes. BlueCard® membership increased due to membership activity at other BCBSA plans whose members reside in or travel to our licensed areas. Individual membership increased due to our Public Exchange expansion in 2022. -48-Other MembershipOur other membership can be impacted by changes in our medical membership, as our medical members often purchase our other products that are ancillary to our health business. Life and disability membership increased primarily due to new sales of disability products, partially offset by declines in our life membership. Dental membership increased primarily due to new sales in our Group risk-based accounts and penetration increases in our FEHB program, partially offset by the loss of a significant Group fee-based account. Dental administration membership increased primarily due to increased sales to other BCBS plans associated with the FEHB program. Vision membership increased primarily due to the launch of a new entry-level vision product in our Group markets. Medicare Part D Standalone membership declined as we discontinued certain legacy products.Consolidated Results of OperationsOur consolidated summarized results of operations and other information for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: Change Years Ended December 312022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020 202220212020$%$%Total operating revenue$155,660 $136,943 $120,808 $18,717 13.7 %$16,135 13.4 %Net investment income1,485 1,378 877 107 7.8 %501 57.1 %Net (losses) gains on financial instruments(550)318 182 (868)(273.0)%136 74.7 %Total revenues156,595 138,639 121,867 17,956 13.0 %16,772 13.8 %Benefit expense116,487 102,645 88,045 13,842 13.5 %14,600 16.6 %Cost of products sold13,035 10,895 8,953 2,140 19.6 %1,942 21.7 %Selling, general and administrative expense17,686 15,914 17,450 1,772 11.1 %(1,536)(8.8)%Other expense1 1,618 1,260 1,181 358 28.4 %79 6.7 %Total expenses148,826 130,714 115,629 18,112 13.9 %15,085 13.0 %Income before income tax expense 7,769 7,925 6,238 (156)(2.0)%1,687 27.0 %Income tax expense1,750 1,830 1,666 (80)(4.4)%164 9.8 %Net income6,019 6,095 4,572 (76)(1.2)%1,523 33.3 %Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 6 9 — (3)(33.3)%9 — %Shareholders’ net income$6,025 $6,104 $4,572 $(79)(1.3)%$1,532 33.5 %Average diluted shares outstanding242.8 246.8 254.3 (4.0)(1.6)%(7.5)(2.9)%Diluted shareholders' net income per share$24.81 $24.73 $17.98 $0.08 0.3 %$6.75 37.5 %Effective tax rate22.5 %23.1 %26.7 %(60)bp3(360)bp3Benefit expense ratio287.4 %87.5 %84.6 %(10)bp3290bp3Selling, general and administrative expense ratio4 11.4 %11.6 %14.4 %(20)bp3(280)bp3Income before income tax expense as a percentage of total revenues5.0 %5.7 %5.1 %(70)bp360bp3Shareholders’ net income as a percentage of total revenues3.8 %4.4 %3.8 %(60)bp360bp3Certain of the following definitions are also applicable to all other results of operations tables in this discussion:NM Not meaningful.1Includes interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets and loss on extinguishment of debt.2Benefit expense ratio represents benefit expense as a percentage of premium revenue.

Membership growth in our Medicare Advantage and our Commercial & Specialty Business risk-based businesses, as well as premium rate increases to cover medical cost trends also generated higher premium revenue. Finally, the increase in operating revenue was further attributable to increased pharmacy product revenue in our CarelonRx segment, resulting from growth in membership and higher script volume. Net investment income increased primarily due to higher income from fixed maturity securities, partially offset by reduced investment income from alternative investments.We had net losses on financial instruments in 2022, as compared to net gains in 2021, as a result of increased net losses on the sale of fixed maturity securities, reduced gains on the sale of equity securities and lower net gains on other invested assets. These losses were partially offset by lower mark-to-market losses on equity securities still held.Benefit expense increased primarily due to healthcare costs associated with organic membership growth in our Medicaid and Medicare businesses and the acquisition of MMM in the second quarter of 2021. Membership growth and higher healthcare costs in our Commercial risk-based business, the acquisition of Integra in the second quarter of 2022 and the acquisition of Ohio Medicaid members through the purchase of a Medicaid contract in the first quarter of 2022 also contributed to higher benefit expense.Our benefit expense ratio decreased slightly primarily due to the realignment during 2022 of certain quality improvement costs, from benefit expenses to administrative expenses, due to regulatory clarification. This decline was partially offset by the impact of continued membership increases in our Government Business segment, which has a higher benefit expense ratio than our Commercial & Specialty Business segment.Cost of products sold reflects the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed by CarelonRx for our unaffiliated PBM customers. Cost of products sold increased as the corresponding pharmacy product revenues increased.Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to increased costs to support membership growth and from our acquisitions, partially offset by lower business optimization charges in 2022 as compared to 2021.Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased primarily due to operating revenue growth in 2022 and lower business optimization charges in 2022 as compared to 2021, partially offset by increased costs to support membership growth and the impact of the realignment of certain quality improvement costs described above.Other expense increased primarily due to additional amortization of intangible assets related to recent acquisitions and the rebranding of our products. The amortization period of certain intangible assets was shortened to align with anticipated dates the new branding will take place. In addition, certain indefinite-lived intangible assets have been reclassified as definite-lived, and therefore, are now being amortized. For additional information regarding intangible asset amortization, see Note 10, ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our effective income tax rate decreased primarily due to the impact of geographic changes in our mix of earnings in 2022.Our shareholders' net income as a percentage of total revenues decreased in 2022 as compared to 2021 as a result of all the factors discussed above.-50-Reportable Segments Results of OperationsThe following table presents a summary of our reportable segment financial information for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: Change Years Ended December 312022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020 202220212020$%$%Operating RevenueCommercial & Specialty Business$41,674 $38,809 $36,699 $2,865 7.4 %$2,110 5.7 %Government Business96,810 82,919 71,572 13,891 16.8 %11,347 15.9 %CarelonRx28,526 25,431 21,911 3,095 12.2 %3,520 16.1 %Other13,294 10,250 6,057 3,044 29.7 %4,193 69.2 %Eliminations(24,644)(20,466)(15,431)(4,178)20.4 %(5,035)32.6 %Total operating revenue$155,660 $136,943 $120,808 $18,717 13.7 %$16,135 13.4 %Operating Gain (Loss)Commercial & Specialty Business1$2,933 $2,753 $2,681 $180 6.5 %$72 2.7 %Government Business23,297 3,061 2,444 236 7.7 %617 25.2 %CarelonRx31,868 1,684 1,361 184 10.9 %323 23.7 %Other4354 (9)(126)363 NM117 NMOperating MarginCommercial & Specialty Business7.0 %7.1 %7.3 %(10)bp5(20)bp5Government Business3.4 %3.7 %3.4 %(30)bp530bp5CarelonRx6.5 %6.6 %6.2 %(10)bp540bp5NM Not meaningful.1Includes expenses of $20 for business optimization initiatives in 2022; $106 for business optimization initiatives in 2021; $311 for business optimization initiatives and $524 for the BCBSA Litigation in 2020.2 Includes expenses of $16 for business optimization initiatives in 2022; $47 for business optimization initiatives in 2021; $205 for business optimization initiatives and $24 for the BCBSA Litigation in 2020.3 Includes expenses of $2 for business optimization initiatives in 2021; $4 for business optimization initiatives in 2020.4 Includes expenses of $3 for business optimization initiatives in 2022; $32 for business optimization initiatives in 2021; $133 for business optimization initiatives in 2020.5 bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%.Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021Commercial & Specialty BusinessOperating revenue increased primarily due to higher premiums in our Commercial risk-based business due to membership growth, premium rate increases in our Commercial risk-based business to cover medical cost trends and increased administrative fees in our Commercial fee-based business.The increase in operating gain was primarily due to improved medical underwriting performance in our Commercial risk-based business and reduced business optimization charges in 2022 as compared to 2021. These items were partially offset by increased costs to support membership growth.Government BusinessOperating revenue increased primarily due to higher premium revenue in our Medicaid business, including due to organic membership growth from the continued temporary suspension of Medicaid eligibility recertification during the -51-COVID-19 pandemic, the acquisition of MMM at the end of the second quarter of 2021, the acquisition of Integra during the second quarter of 2022 and the acquisition of Ohio Medicaid members through the purchase of a Medicaid contract in the first quarter of 2022. Membership growth and premium rate increases to cover medical cost trends in our Medicare Advantage business also contributed to higher premium revenue.The increase in operating gain was primarily driven by premium rate increases to cover medical cost trends in our Medicare business, organic membership growth in our Medicaid business from the continued suspension of eligibility recertifications during the COVID-19 pandemic and the acquisition of MMM in the second quarter of 2021. These increases were partially offset by additional administrative spend to support the growth in our Government business. CarelonRxOperating revenue increased as a result of growth in membership and higher script volume. The increase in operating gain was primarily a result of higher script volume, driven by growth in integrated medical and pharmacy members in 2022 and favorable out-of-period adjustments to fee-based revenue in the second half of 2022.OtherOperating revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue for expanded services performed by Carelon Services for our Commercial & Specialty Business segment in 2022 and the acquisition of myNEXUS in the second quarter of 2021. These increases were partially offset by the reduction of external revenue due to the loss of a behavioral health contract in 2022.The increase in operating gain was driven by improved performance in Carelon Services, the acquisition of myNEXUS in the second quarter of 2021, and a decline in unallocated corporate expenses in 2022.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider our most important accounting policies that require significant estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our other significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third-party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. Estimates can require a significant amount of judgment, and a different set of assumptions could result in material changes to our reported results.Medical Claims PayableThe most subjective accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2022, this liability was $15,596 and represented 23% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 94%, or $14,736, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2022; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 6%, or $860, of the total medical claims payable as of December 31, 2022. The level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period-end to the next, from approximately 1% to 6% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made.-52-Liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in the aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Our reserving practice for claim liabilities is to consistently recognize the appropriate amount of reserve within a level of confidence required by Actuarial Standards of Practice. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that uses both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period-end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and healthcare trend levels (“trend factors”). Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison to prior periods, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather, the availability of additional paid claims information drives changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense. We had increased estimation uncertainty on our incurred but not reported liability at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Slowdowns in claims submission patterns and increases in utilization levels for COVID-19 testing and treatment are the primary factors that lead to the increased estimation uncertainty.We regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are materially different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of healthcare costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable.Although there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid claims liability as of December 31, 2022 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations.There is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through twelve months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. In our analysis for the claim liabilities at December 31, 2022, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 40 -53-and 90 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower estimated variability ranging from 0 to 30 basis points.The difference in completion factor assumptions results in variability of 2%, or approximately $266, in the December 31, 2022 incurred but not paid claims liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein.The other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2022 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. In our analysis for the period ended December 31, 2022, there was a 310 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 3%, or approximately $522, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factors used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claims liability at December 31, 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an impact on claim costs for recent dates of service, which could have an influence on our trend factors. We will continue to monitor emerging experience in order to better understand the possible implications to our reserves.See Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year.” Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. The ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 87.3% for 2022, 87.8% for 2021 and 87.7% for 2020. This ratio serves as an indicator of claims processing speed whereby 2022 claims were processed at a slightly slower speed than 2021 and 2020.We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2022, this metric was 7.0%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, this metric was 18.1%, reflecting the estimation uncertainty due to COVID-19 at the end of 2020, and was largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2020 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this metric was 8.0%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2019 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2019. We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation supports the reasonableness of our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims and the consistency in our methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2022, this metric was 0.9%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $869. This metric was 2.0% for 2021 and 0.8% for 2020. We believe these metrics support the reasonableness of our estimates. The 2021 metric was impacted by the estimation uncertainty due to COVID-19.The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for each of 2021 and 2020 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as -54-the difference between “net incurred medical claims – current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims – prior years redundancies” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 20212020Total net incurred medical claims, as reported$98,737 $84,457 Retrospective basis, as described above99,571 83,391 Variance$(834)$1,066 Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported(0.8)%1.3 %Given that our business is primarily short tailed (which means that medical claims are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider), the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2022 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2023.The 2021 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of (0.8)% was less than the 2020 percentage of 1.3%. This was primarily driven by the fact that the change in the prior year redundancy reported for 2021 as compared to 2020 was less than the change in the prior year redundancy reported for 2020 as compared to 2019.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance, which requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance.At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following:•the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset;•the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim;•the tax rate at which the deferred tax assets will likely be utilized in the future;•the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; •the implementation of tax planning strategies to recover those deferred tax assets; and•any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences.Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits, as required by the applicable guidance. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted.In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law, and we intend to defend our positions vigorously through the federal, state and local, and foreign appeals processes. We believe we have -55-adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact on our results of operations or financial condition from these matters.For additional information, see Note 8, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsOur consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2022 was $24,383 and other intangible assets were $10,315. The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets represented 33.8% of our total consolidated assets and 95.6% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2022.We follow FASB guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, which include goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately.We complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. These tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Certain interim impairment tests are also performed when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, which is an indication that our goodwill may be impaired. These qualitative impairment tests include assessing events and factors that could affect the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our procedures include assessing our financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, various asset specific factors and entity specific events. If we determine that a reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired after utilizing these qualitative impairment analysis procedures, we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test.Our quantitative impairment test utilizes the projected income and market valuation approaches for goodwill and the projected income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. Use of the projected income and market valuation approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. The projected income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. These estimated future cash flows are then discounted. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted-average cost of capital. Market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including revenue; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; and book value of invested capital (debt and equity) and include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry.We did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2022 annual impairment tests, as it was determined that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying values as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, we do not believe that the estimated fair values of our reporting units are at risk of becoming impaired in the next twelve months. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.For additional information, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions” and Note 10, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. -56-InvestmentsCurrent and long-term marketable investment securities were $27,657 at December 31, 2022 and represented 26.9% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2022. We classify fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” and report those securities at fair value. Certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity.Our impairment review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors. Such factors considered include the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. If a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we write down the fixed maturity security’s cost basis to fair value and record an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, we recognize the credit component of the impairment as an allowance for credit loss in our consolidated balance sheets and record an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. The non-credit component of the impairment is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit-related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. The credit component of an impairment is determined primarily by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of purchase. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral, including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default.We have a committee of accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. We believe that we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. We have established an allowance for credit loss and recorded credit loss expense as a reflection of our expected impairment losses. Given the inherent uncertainty of changes in market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional impairment losses on investments may be recorded in future periods. In addition to marketable investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $5,685, or 5.5% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2022. These long-term investments consisted primarily of certain other equity investments, the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and mortgage loans. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term.Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits on investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future results of operations and financial condition. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $26,704 at December 31, 2022. The weighted-average credit rating of these securities was “A” as of December 31, 2022. Included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions of $890 that are guaranteed by third parties. With the exception of 16 securities with a fair value of $9, -57-these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2022. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors, and we do not have any material exposure to any single guarantor, neither indirectly through the guarantees, nor directly through investment in the guarantor. Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of the fixed maturity securities without a guarantee, for which such information is available, was “A” as of December 31, 2022.Fair values of fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third-party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with FASB guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. We have controls in place to review the pricing services’ qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. In addition, we periodically review the pricing services’ pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable.We obtain quoted market prices for each security from the pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in these valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform analysis on the prices received from the pricing services to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes procedures such as a review of month-to-month price fluctuations and price comparisons to secondary pricing services. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from the pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.In certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. Such securities are designated Level III in accordance with FASB guidance. Securities designated Level III at December 31, 2022 totaled $581 and represented approximately 1.7% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level III securities primarily consisted of certain corporate securities and equity securities for which observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields.For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” and Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” Note 5, “Investments,” and Note 7, “Fair Value,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Retirement BenefitsPension BenefitsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for some of our employees. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FASB guidance for retirement benefits, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by the guidance, we calculate the value of plan assets as described below. Further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods. An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our December 31, 2022 measurement date, we selected a weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.58%. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and an average of historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase.This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is -58-included in the determination of pension expense. We apply a corridor approach to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. Under this approach, only accumulated net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the average remaining service or lifetime of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date. We use the annual spot rate approach for setting our discount rate. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot rates from a full yield curve of published rates are used to discount each plan’s cash flows to determine the plan’s obligation. At the December 31, 2022 measurement date, the weighted-average discount rate under the annual spot rate approach was 5.18%, compared to 2.70% at the December 31, 2021 measurement date. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FASB guidance.In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of equity securities, investment grade fixed maturity securities and other types of investments across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow.Other Postretirement BenefitsWe provide some associates with certain medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate and the expected trend in healthcare costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits.At our December 31, 2022 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 5.12%, compared to a discount rate of 2.49% at the December 31, 2021 measurement rate. We developed this rate using the annual spot rate approach as described above. The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of pre-Medicare (those who are not currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2022 measurement date was 8.00% for 2023 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2035. The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of post-Medicare (those who are currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2022 measurement date was 6.50% for 2023 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2035. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future.For additional information regarding our retirement benefits, see Note 11, “Retirement Benefits,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.New Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended December 31, 2022 that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures, see the “Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance” and “Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted” sections of Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesIntroductionOur cash receipts result primarily from premiums, product revenue, administrative fees and other revenue, investment income, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. Cash outflows -59-fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity.We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy.A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations.The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. The securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility. Interest rates on fixed debt income securities increased in 2022 and may continue to do so in 2023, which could increase our borrowing costs if we elect to issue debt. During recent years, the federal government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. In addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide stability and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions. A summary of our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: Years Ended December 31$ Change 2022202120202022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020Sources of Cash:Net cash provided by operating activities$8,399 $8,364 $10,688 $35 $(2,324)Issuances of commercial paper and short- and long-term debt, net of repayments862 2,719 — (1,857)2,719 Issuances of common stock under employee stock plans182 203 176 (21)27 Other sources of cash, net762 — 315 762 (315)Total sources of cash10,205 11,286 11,179 (1,081)107 Uses of Cash:Purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales, maturities, calls and redemptions(2,338)(4,056)(3,433)1,718 (623)Repurchase and retirement of common stock(2,316)(1,900)(2,700)(416)800 Purchases of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired(649)(3,476)(1,976)2,827 (1,500)Purchases of property and equipment(1,152)(1,087)(1,021)(65)(66)Repayments of commercial paper and short- and long-term debt, net of issuances— — (298)— 298 Cash dividends(1,229)(1,104)(954)(125)(150)Other uses of cash, net— (514)— 514 (514)Total uses of cash(7,684)(12,137)(10,382)4,453 (1,755)Effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(14)(10)7 (4)(17)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$2,507 $(861)$804 $3,368 $(1,665)-60-Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021The slight increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income in 2022, when adjusted for the impact of investment losses and gains, partially offset by the timing of working capital changes and the payment pursuant to the Subscriber Settlement Agreement made in September 2022.Other significant changes in sources and uses of cash year-over-year included lower amounts used for purchases of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired and reduced cash used for purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales, maturities, calls and redemptions. These decreased uses of cash were partially offset by reduced net proceeds received from the issuance of commercial paper and short-term and long-term debt and increased use of cash for share repurchases.Financial ConditionWe maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities of $35,044 at December 31, 2022. Since December 31, 2021, total cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $1,384, primarily due to cash generated from operations. This increase was partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, common stock repurchases, purchases of property and equipment and cash dividends paid to shareholders.Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Certain accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities, or statutory accounting practices, differ from GAAP. Changes that occur in statutory accounting practices, if any, or other regulatory requirements, could impact our subsidiaries’ future dividend capacity. In addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries.At December 31, 2022, we held $1,209 of cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company, which are available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, potential future common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders, repurchases of debt securities and debt and interest payments. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue debt (“Notes”) for long-term borrowing purposes, for example, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. Certain of these Notes may have a call feature that allows us to redeem the Notes at any time at our option and/or a put feature that allows a Note holder to redeem the Notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating. For more information on our debt, including redemptions and issuances, see Note 13, “Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We calculate our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, a non-GAAP measure, from the amounts presented on our audited consolidated balance sheets included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total debt plus total shareholders’ equity. Total debt is the sum of short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt, less current portion. We believe our debt-to-capital ratio assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. In addition, our bank covenants include a maximum debt-to-capital ratio that we cannot and did not exceed. Our debt-to-capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio was 39.9% and 38.9% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Our senior debt is rated “A” by S&P Global Ratings, “BBB” by Fitch Ratings, Inc., “Baa2” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by limitations on future borrowings and a potential increase in our borrowing costs.Capital ResourcesWe have a shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for -61-general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries and the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansions.We have a senior revolving credit facility (the “5-Year Facility”) with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. In April 2022, we amended and restated the credit agreement for the 5-Year Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the 5-Year Facility from June 2024 to April 2027 and increase the amount of credit available under the 5-Year Facility from $2,500 to $4,000. Also in April 2022, concurrently with the amendment and restatement of the 5-Year Facility, we terminated our 364-day senior revolving credit facility that provided for credit in the amount of $1,000, which was scheduled to mature in June 2022. Our ability to borrow under the 5-Year Facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt-to-capital ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the credit agreement for the 5-Year Facility. We do not believe the restrictions contained in our 5-Year Facility covenants materially affect our financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants under the 5-Year Facility. There were no amounts outstanding under the 5-Year Facility at December 31, 2022.Through certain subsidiaries, we have entered into multiple 364-day lines of credit (the “Subsidiary Credit Facilities”) with separate lenders for general corporate purposes. The Subsidiary Credit Facilities provide combined credit up to $200. Our ability to borrow under the Subsidiary Credit Facilities is subject to compliance with certain covenants. At December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Subsidiary Credit Facilities.We have an authorized commercial paper program of up to $4,000, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. In July 2022, we increased the amount available under the commercial paper program from $3,500 to $4,000. Should commercial paper issuance become unavailable, we have the ability to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our 5-Year Facility, which provides for credit in the amount of $4,000, to redeem any outstanding commercial paper upon maturity. At December 31, 2022, we had $0 outstanding under our commercial paper program.While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we believe the lenders participating in our 5-Year Facility and Subsidiary Credit Facilities, if market conditions allow, would be willing to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations.We are a member, through certain subsidiaries, of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (collectively the “FHLBs”). As a member, we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. At December 31, 2022, we had $265 of outstanding short-term borrowings from the FHLBs.As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we currently estimate that approximately $3,500 of dividends will be paid to us by our subsidiaries during 2023. During 2022, we received $3,097 of dividends from our subsidiaries.In addition to regulations regarding the timing and amount of dividends, our regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for health and other insurance companies and health maintenance organizations largely based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) Risk-Based Capital (RBC) For Health Organizations Model Act (“RBC Model Act”). These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under the RBC Model Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our regulated subsidiaries’ respective RBC levels as of December 31, 2022, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, were in excess of all applicable mandatory RBC requirements. In addition to exceeding these RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries. For additional information, see Note 22, “Statutory Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.-62-Future Sources and Uses of LiquidityShort-Term Liquidity RequirementsAs previously described, our cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. We believe cash on hand, operating cash receipts, investments and amounts available under our commercial paper program, our 5-Year Facility and our Subsidiary Credit Facilities and borrowings available from the FHLBs will be adequate to fund our expected cash disbursements over the next twelve months.Long-Term Liquidity RequirementsAs of December 31, 2022, our long-term cash disbursements required under various contractual obligations and commitments were:•Debt and interest expense: Future debt and estimated interest payments were $25,804, with $2,674 due within the next twelve months. For additional information, see Note 13 “Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.•Operating leases: We lease office space and certain computer equipment, for which the future estimated payments were $1,028, with $206 due within the next twelve months. For additional information, see Note 18 “Leases” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.•Other liabilities: These liabilities primarily consist of future policy reserves, projected other postretirement benefits, deferred compensation, supplemental executive retirement plan liabilities and certain other miscellaneous long-term obligations. Amounts due within twelve months were $26, with $1,040 due in future periods. Estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from these numbers, as we had no funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, at December 31, 2022, as a result of the value of the assets in the plans. In addition, gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions and interest for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities have not been included. For further information, see Note 8, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.•Purchase obligations: These obligations include estimated payments for future services under contractual arrangements from third-party service vendors. Amounts due within the next twelve months for these purchase obligations were $1,124, while longer term payments were $2,927. For further information, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.•Investment commitments: These include unfunded capital commitments for alternative investments and low-income housing tax credits. Estimated amounts due were $1,504, including $314 due within the next twelve months. In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. We regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions, common stock and debt security repurchases and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.On January 24, 2023, our Audit Committee declared a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $1.48 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on March 24, 2023 to the shareholders of record as of March 10, 2023.Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2022, we had Board authorization of $1,876 to repurchase our common stock. On January 24, 2023, our Audit Committee, -63-pursuant to authorization granted by the Board of Directors, authorized a $5,000 increase to our common stock repurchase program. No duration has been placed on our common stock repurchase program, and we reserve the right to discontinue the program at any time. We intend to utilize this authorization over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions.We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our credit facilities and/or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions.We do not have any off-balance sheet derivative instruments, guarantee transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements or any indemnification agreements that will require funding in future periods. We have not transferred assets to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not hold any variable interest in an unconsolidated entity where such entity provides us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. See Note 2 “Subsidiary Transactions” of the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional detail on the Elevance Health, Inc. parent guarantees of certain subsidiaries.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. (In Millions, Except As Otherwise Stated Herein)As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2022. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return.InvestmentsOur investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk.The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit event, such as a ratings downgrade or default, to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that event. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately “A.” Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which have exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value.Investments in fixed maturity securities include corporate securities, which account for 46.9% of our total fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2022 and are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase, prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. We manage this risk through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of our corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately “BBB.”Market risk for fixed maturity securities is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $1,088 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $1,154 increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our -64-cash flows and the duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly.Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities, exchange-traded funds and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systemic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio.Our other invested assets, reported within our long-term investments, are primarily subject to private market exposures, including private equity and private credit investments. These investments are also indirectly subject to market valuation risk, as public market valuations will form a basis for valuations for these investments. Given their illiquid nature, we focus on appropriate sizing of these investments relative to our liquidity needs and risk tolerance. Our risk tolerance is formed by the level of illiquidity and short-term price movements from market valuation risk we are willing to accept relative to the higher long-term expected returns over the life of these investments.As of December 31, 2022, 3.4% of our marketable investments were equity securities. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $95. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $95.For additional information regarding our investments, see Note 5, “Investments,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Investments” within Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Long-Term DebtOur total long-term debt at December 31, 2022 consisted of senior unsecured notes, convertible debentures, commercial paper and subordinated surplus notes issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $23,849 and $22,324 respectively. This debt is subject to interest rate risk, as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. For additional information regarding our long-term debt, see Note 7, “Fair Value” and Note 13, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Derivatives We have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts, which are used to lock-in interest rates or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. We have used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities.Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these derivatives. As of December 31, 2022, we recorded a net liability of $57, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swaps’ fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $39 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $39 increase in fair value.For additional information regarding our derivatives, see Note 6, “Derivative Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. -65-",2023-12-30 18:52:24.425660

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates X. Liquidity and Capital Resources XI. Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 I. Overview We are one of the nation’s leading health benefits companies and we operate as an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA. We offer Blue Cross Blue Shield branded products to customers throughout Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, Colorado, Nevada and Virginia (excluding the immediate suburbs of Washington, D.C.). As of December 31, 2003, we provided health benefit services to more than 11.9 million members of our health plans. Our health business segments are strategic business units delineated by geographic areas within which we offer similar products and services. We manage our health business segments with a local focus to address each market’s unique competitive, regulatory and health care delivery characteristics. Our health business segments are: Midwest, which includes Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio; East, which includes Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine; West, which includes Colorado and Nevada; and Southeast, which is Virginia, excluding the immediate suburbs of Washington D.C. 38 Table of Contents In addition to our four health business segments, our reportable segments include a Specialty segment that is comprised of businesses providing group life and disability insurance benefits, pharmacy benefit management, dental and vision administration services and behavioral health benefits services. During the third quarter of 2002, we sold our third party occupational health services businesses, which were part of our Specialty segment. The results of these businesses were not material to earnings of this segment or our consolidated results. Our Specialty segment is not delineated by geography. Our Other segment is comprised of AdminaStar Federal, which administers Medicare programs in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, Maine and New Hampshire; intersegment revenue and expense eliminations; and corporate expenses not allocated to our health or Specialty segments. In 2001, our Other segment also contained Anthem Alliance Health Insurance Company, or Anthem Alliance. Anthem Alliance primarily provided health care benefits and administration in nine states for the Department of Defense’s TRICARE Program for military families. We sold our TRICARE operations on May 31, 2001. We offer a diversified mix of managed care products, including preferred provider organizations or PPOs, health maintenance organizations or HMOs, traditional indemnity benefits to members of our fully-insured products and point of service or POS plans. We also provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers, including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management and other administrative services. Our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. The premiums come from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Our administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, from the administration of Medicare programs and from other health-related businesses including disease management programs. Other revenue is principally generated from member co-payments and deductibles associated with the mail-order sale of drugs by our pharmacy benefit management company. Our benefit expense includes costs of care for health services consumed by our members such as outpatient care, inpatient care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital procedures per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and customs in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense for each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Our administrative expense consists of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation and amortization and facilities expenses. Other costs are variable or discretionary in nature. Certain variable costs, such as broker and commission expenses and premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium, but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels, and thus salary and benefit expense. Discretionary costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity. Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members. Several economic factors related to health care costs such as regulatory mandates for coverage and direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating health care costs as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material impact on our results of operations. 39 Table of Contents This management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. II. Significant Transactions On October 27, 2003, we and WellPoint Health Networks Inc., or WellPoint, announced that we entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger, or Merger Agreement, pursuant to which WellPoint will merge into our wholly-owned subsidiary. WellPoint offers a broad spectrum of network-based managed care plans through its subsidiaries operating under the trade names of Blue Cross of California, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Missouri, Blue Cross Blue Shield United of Wisconsin, HealthLink and UNICARE. WellPoint’s managed care plans include PPOs, HMOs, POSs, traditional indemnity and other hybrid plans. In addition, WellPoint offers managed care services, including underwriting, actuarial services, network access, medical management and claims processing. WellPoint also provides a broad array of specialty and other products, including pharmacy benefits management, dental, vision, life insurance, preventive care, disability insurance, behavioral health, COBRA and flexible benefits account administration. Under the Merger Agreement, WellPoint’s stockholders will receive consideration of twenty-three dollars and eighty cents in cash and one share of our common stock for each WellPoint share outstanding. The value of the transaction is estimated to be approximately $16.4 billion based on the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on October 24, 2003. On February 26, 2004, we received notification of early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. The transaction is expected to close by mid-2004, subject to, among other things, state regulatory and shareholder approvals. WellPoint reported the following financial results for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001: Years Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 ($ in Millions) Total revenues $ 20,359.7 $ 17,338.5 $ 12,428.6 Net income 935.2 703.1 414.7 December 31 2003 2002 ($ in Millions) Assets $ 14,788.7 $ 11,470.6 Liabilities 9,358.7 7,493.9 Stockholders’ equity 5,430.0 3,976.7 On July 31, 2002, we completed the purchase of 100% of the outstanding stock of Trigon Healthcare, Inc., or Trigon. Trigon was Virginia’s largest health benefits company and was the Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensee in Virginia, excluding the immediate suburbs of Washington, D.C. With the acquisition we formed our Southeast segment. The Trigon acquisition allowed us to further expand our territory as a Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee. The results of operations for Trigon are included in our consolidated income statement after completion of the acquisition. Trigon’s shareholders each received consideration of thirty dollars in cash and 1.062 shares of Anthem common stock for each Trigon share outstanding. The purchase price was approximately $4,038.1 million, which included cash of approximately $1,104.3 million, the issuance of approximately 39.0 million shares of Anthem common stock, valued at approximately $2,708.1 million, Trigon stock options converted into Anthem stock options for approximately 3.9 million shares, valued at approximately $195.5 million and approximately $30.2 million of transaction costs. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this discussion for more information related to the sources of funds for this acquisition. See Notes 2 and 3 of our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, included in 40 Table of Contents Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K for additional information concerning the pro forma impact of Trigon on our consolidated financial statements. On May 31, 2001, we and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas, or BCBS-KS, announced that we signed a definitive agreement pursuant to which BCBS-KS would become our wholly owned subsidiary. On February 11, 2002, the Kansas Insurance Commissioner disapproved the proposed transaction, which had been previously approved by the BCBS-KS policyholders in January 2002. We joined BCBS-KS in an appeal of the Commissioner’s decision, which was filed with the Shawnee County District Court on March 7, 2002. On June 7, 2002, the Shawnee County District Court ruled in favor of us and BCBS-KS. The Shawnee County District Court directed the Commissioner to re-evaluate her decision in accordance with the Court’s very specific interpretation of the Kansas law. On June 10, 2002, the Kansas Insurance Commissioner appealed the District Court’s ruling to the Kansas Supreme Court. On August 6, 2003, the Kansas Supreme Court overturned the Shawnee County District Court’s ruling and reinstated the Kansas Insurance Commissioner’s 2002 disapproval of the proposed transaction. We and BCBS-KS decided not to appeal this decision and the definitive agreement was terminated. III. Membership—December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Our membership includes seven different customer types: Local Large Group, Small Group, Individual, National Accounts, Medicare + Choice, Federal Employee Program and Medicaid. • Local Large Group consists of those customers with 51 or more employees eligible to participate as a member in one of our health plans. • Small Group consists of those customers with one to 50 eligible employees. • Individual members include those who are under age 65 as well as members who are age 65 and over and have purchased Medicare Supplement benefit coverage. • National Accounts customers are multi-state employer groups headquartered in an Anthem service area with 1,000 or more eligible employees, including 50 or more located in a service area where Anthem is not a BCBSA licensee. Included within the National Accounts business are customers who represent enrollees of other Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans, or the “home” plans, who receive health care services in our Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensed markets. These customers are primarily BlueCard members. • Medicare + Choice members (age 65 and over) have enrolled in coverages that are managed care alternatives for the Medicare program. • The Federal Employee Program, or FEP, provides health insurance coverage to United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. • Medicaid membership represents eligible members with state sponsored managed care alternatives in the Medicaid programs that we manage for the states of Connecticut and Virginia. BlueCard membership, reported with National Accounts membership, is calculated based on the amount of BlueCard administrative fees we receive from the BlueCard members’ home plans. We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard members, while other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information, is performed by the home plan. The administrative fees we receive are based on one of two methods of reimbursement. Accordingly, we calculate our BlueCard membership differently based on each method of reimbursement. The first method of reimbursement is derived from the number and type of claims we process, both institutional and professional, and a portion of the network discount on those claims. To calculate BlueCard membership from this reimbursement method, administrative fees are divided by an average per member per month, or PMPM, factor. The average PMPM factor is determined using a historical average administrative fee per claim and an average number of claims per member per year based on our experience and BCBSA guidelines. The second method of reimbursement is a negotiated per contract basis. To calculate BlueCard membership from this reimbursement method, the number of contracts in force are multiplied by an assumed member per contract ratio. 41 Table of Contents In addition to reporting our membership by customer type, we report membership by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain some or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some employers choose to purchase stop-loss coverage to limit their retained risk. These employers are reported with our self-funded business. The renewal patterns of our fully-insured Local Large Group and Small Group business are as follows: approximately 35% of renewals occur during the first quarter, approximately 20% of renewals occur during the second quarter, approximately 30% of renewals occur during the third quarter and approximately 15% of renewals occur during the fourth quarter. These renewal patterns have remained relatively consistent over the past several years and allow us to adjust our pricing and benefit plan designs in response to market conditions throughout the year. The following table presents our health membership by customer type, funding arrangement and segment as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. The membership data presented is unaudited and in certain instances includes estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period, rounded to the nearest thousand. December 31 2003 2002 Change % (In Thousands) Customer Type Local Large Group 3,869 3,867 2 — % Small Group 1,257 1,168 89 8 Individual 1,202 1,084 118 11 National Accounts 1 4,596 3,951 645 16 Medicare + Choice 94 103 (9 ) (9 ) Federal Employee Program 699 677 22 3 Medicaid 210 203 7 3 Total 11,927 11,053 874 8 % Funding Arrangement Self-funded 6,412 5,617 795 14 % Fully-insured 5,515 5,436 79 1 Total 11,927 11,053 874 8 % Segment Midwest 5,688 5,234 454 9 % East 2,600 2,434 166 7 West 939 836 103 12 Southeast 2,700 2,549 151 6 Total 11,927 11,053 874 8 % 1 Includes 2,816 BlueCard members as of December 31, 2003 and 2,419 BlueCard members as of December 31, 2002. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, total membership increased approximately 874,000, or 8%, primarily in our National Accounts and Individual businesses. The primary driver of our membership change was the increase in National Accounts membership of 645,000, or 16%, which primarily resulted from a significant increase in BlueCard activity and enrollment gains 42 Table of Contents in our other self-funded National Accounts business. BlueCard growth is primarily attributed to increased sales by other Blue Cross Blue Shield licensees to accounts with members who reside in or travel to our licensed areas. Our National Accounts self-funded business growth is attributed to increased sales in our existing markets due to recognition of the value of our networks and the related discounts we can secure, and our competitive advantage resulting from the breadth of our product offerings and distinctive customer service. Also contributing to our membership increase were Individual business enrollment gains of 118,000, or 11%, primarily due to the introduction of new, more affordable product designs and an overall increase in consumer awareness of our wide variety of quality products and services. Self-funded membership increased 795,000, or 14%, primarily due to increases in BlueCard activity and our other self-funded National Accounts business. Fully-insured membership increased by 79,000 members, or 1%, primarily in our Individual and Small Group businesses, as explained above. In addition, we experienced a change in our mix of business by funding arrangement as certain Local Large Group and National Accounts customers shifted from fully-insured to self-funded during the year ended December 31, 2003. Due to current economic conditions, certain large accounts are assuming the health care risk associated with insuring their employees. This shift in funding arrangements did not have a material impact on our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2003. IV. Cost of Care—Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2002 The following discussion summarizes our aggregate cost of care trends for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2003 compared to the 12-month period ended December 31, 2002, for our Local Large Group and Small Group fully-insured businesses only. Membership in these two customer groups represented approximately 60% of our premium income for the year ended December 31, 2003. In all of our cost of care trends presented below, we have included the necessary information associated with Trigon experience for both rolling 12-month periods, including periods prior to our July 31, 2002 acquisition. Our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing the year over year change in average per member per month claim costs for which we are responsible, which excludes member co-payments and deductibles. Our consolidated cost of care trends as of December 31, 2003 are as follows: Cost ofcare trend Percent of costof care expense Aggregate 9 % 100 % Inpatient services 10 21 Outpatient services 10 24 Professional services 10 36 Pharmacy 8 19 Our aggregate cost of care trend was approximately 9%, driven primarily by increased professional services costs and outpatient services costs. We believe that our cost of care trends will range from 9.5% to 10.5% in 2004, an increase from 2003 trends primarily due to expected increases in our 2004 pharmacy costs. Inpatient services costs increased approximately 10%. About 80% of this trend resulted from unit cost increases and about 20% resulted from utilization increases. The unit cost increases were primarily due to implementation of new provider contracts and a health care industry shift of lower-cost procedures to outpatient settings, resulting in a mix of more complex and expensive procedures being performed in inpatient settings. Utilization increases resulted primarily from increases in cardiovascular and orthopedic admissions. In response to increasing inpatient services costs, we have implemented and continue to expand our disease management programs, which are programs that address specific diseases such as diabetes and asthma, and our advanced care management programs, which are programs designed to focus on our members with needs for care in response to complex and acute health challenges. In addition, we continue to implement performance-based contracts that reward improved clinical outcomes, quality and patient safety. 43 Table of Contents Outpatient services costs increased approximately 10%, driven approximately two thirds by unit cost increases and one third by utilization increases. Unit costs per visit increased as more procedures are being performed during each visit to an outpatient provider, as well as the impact of price increases imposed within certain provider contracts. Efforts to mitigate unit cost trends for outpatient services include contracting strategies using fixed rate fee schedules, plan design changes to include new or higher co-payments for certain outpatient services, selective contracting with freestanding specialty facilities, expansion of our radiology management network program and broader use of national contracting programs. Increased utilization is primarily due to additional visits for outpatient surgery and radiology services, as well as a continuing shift of certain procedures previously performed in an inpatient setting to an outpatient setting, such as selected cardiac care procedures. Professional services costs increased approximately 10%. Our professional services trend increased approximately 45% due to utilization and approximately 55% due to unit cost. Utilization increases were driven primarily by increases in physician office visits, radiology procedures such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or MRIs, Positron Emission Tomography procedures, or PET scans, and laboratory procedures. Office visit utilization was driven by increased visits to cardiology, oncology and gastroenterology specialists. Unit cost increases were driven primarily by increases in physician reimbursement schedules. In response to increasing professional services costs, we continue to promote and implement performance-based contracts that reward clinical outcomes and quality; develop clinical affiliations to advance uniform, evidence-based medical care and preventive guidelines; and expand our collaborative relationships with professional medical societies. Pharmacy benefit costs increased approximately 8%. Our pharmacy trend increased approximately 75% due to unit cost and approximately 25% due to utilization. Unit costs were increased primarily by price increases on existing brand drugs and, to a lesser extent, the introduction of new, higher cost drugs. However, unit cost growth has slowed due to an increase in the use of generic alternatives to branded drugs and price reduction on certain older generic drugs. Growth in utilization has slowed due to plan design changes; the impact of Claritin, an antihistamine drug, becoming available over-the-counter in late 2002; the impact of a study that concluded that hormone replacement therapy for most post-menopausal women is not recommended; and lower antibiotic usage. The introduction of new drugs continues to increase trends, supported by direct-to-consumer advertising by pharmaceutical companies and expanded physician prescriptions of drugs that manage chronic conditions such as high cholesterol and gastrointestinal disease. In response to increasing pharmacy benefit costs, we are implementing modified plan designs and we have recontracted with retail pharmacies in an effort to secure better pricing. We have also expanded several clinical initiatives designed to improve quality such as drug utilization review, programs to detect and prevent misuse of prescription drugs and programs designed to educate physicians and members about the appropriate use of antibiotics. In addition, we continually evaluate our drug formulary to ensure appropriate pharmaceutical therapies for our members. We have about two-thirds of our membership in three-tier drug programs and do not expect significant change from that level. 44 Table of Contents V. Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2002 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: Years Ended December 31 Change 2003 2002 $ % ($ in Millions, Except Per Share Data) Premiums $ 15,170.2 $ 11,941.0 $ 3,229.2 27 % Administrative fees 1,180.7 962.2 218.5 23 Other revenue 126.2 87.3 38.9 45 Total operating revenue 1 16,477.1 12,990.5 3,486.6 27 Net investment income 278.1 260.7 17.4 7 Net realized gains on investments 17.8 30.4 (12.6 ) (41 ) Gain (loss) on sale of subsidiary operations (1.6 ) 0.7 (2.3 ) NM2 Total revenue 16,771.4 13,282.3 3,489.1 26 Benefit expense 12,263.9 9,839.4 2,424.5 25 Administrative expense 3,109.6 2,506.6 603.0 24 Interest expense 131.2 98.5 32.7 33 Amortization of other intangible assets 47.6 30.2 17.4 58 Total expense 15,552.3 12,474.7 3,077.6 25 Income before taxes and minority interest 1,219.1 807.6 411.5 51 Income taxes 440.1 255.2 184.9 72 Minority interest 4.7 3.3 1.4 42 Net income $ 774.3 $ 549.1 $ 225.2 41 % Average basic shares outstanding (in millions) 138.3 119.0 19.3 16 % Average diluted shares outstanding (in millions) 142.0 121.8 20.2 17 % Basic net income per share $ 5.60 $ 4.61 $ 0.99 21 % Diluted net income per share $ 5.45 $ 4.51 $ 0.94 21 % Benefit expense ratio 3 80.8 % 82.4 % (160 ) bp 4 Administrative expense ratio 5 18.9 % 19.3 % (40 ) bp 4 Income before income taxes and minority interest as a percentage of total revenue 6 7.3 % 6.1 % 120 bp 4 Net income as a percentage of total revenue 7 4.6 % 4.1 % 50 bp 4 Certain of the following definitions are also applicable to all other results of operations tables in this discussion: 1 Premium equivalents, which are not revenue, are measures of the amount of claims attributable to non-Medicare, self-funded health business where we provide a complete array of customer service, claims administration, billing and enrollment services, but the customer retains the risk of funding payments for health benefits provided to members. We add premium equivalents to operating revenue to allow for a comparison of business volume among companies with differing levels of revenues from fully-insured and self-funded businesses. We believe operating revenue and premium equivalents is a useful analytical measure because it eliminates fluctuations in operating revenue caused by changes in the mix of fully-insured and self-funded business. Premium equivalents, which are not included in operating revenue above, for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $7,692.5 million and $5,271.0 million, respectively. 2 NM = Not meaningful. 3 Benefit expense ratio = Benefit expense ÷ Premiums. 4 bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%. 5 Administrative expense ratio = Administrative expense ÷ Total operating revenue. 6 Income before income taxes and minority interest as a percentage of total revenue = income before income taxes and minority interest ÷ total revenue. 7 Net income as a percentage of total revenue = net income ÷ total revenue. 45 Table of Contents Throughout the following discussion of our results of operations, “same-store” excludes the operating results of our Southeast segment, which was formed following our Trigon acquisition, for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the five months ended December 31, 2002. Premiums increased $3,229.2 million, or 27%, to $15,170.2 million in 2003. Our premium yields, net of buy-downs for our fully-insured Local Large Group and Small Group businesses, were approximately 10% on a rolling 12-month basis as of December 31, 2003. On a same-store basis, premiums increased $1,108.9 million, or 10%, primarily due to premium rate increases in our Local Large Group, Small Group and Federal Employee Program businesses. Also contributing to premium growth was higher fully-insured membership, primarily in our Individual and Small Group businesses, which was partially offset by changes in the mix of our fully-insured products with members selecting less rich benefit designs, resulting in lower priced products. Also offsetting the growth were shifts by certain Local Large Group and National Accounts customers to self-funding arrangements, resulting in lower revenues. The claims costs in certain Southeast lines of business were much lower than anticipated. Therefore, our Southeast segment issued premiums refunds to certain Individual business policyholders in the aggregate amount of $40.4 million, offsetting our premium growth. Administrative fees increased $218.5 million, or 23%, to $1,180.7 million in 2003. On a same-store basis, administrative fees increased $30.8 million, or 4%, primarily due to increased BlueCard activity and increased revenues from self-funded membership, some of which resulted from the shift of customers from fully-insured arrangements. These increases were partially offset by decreased administrative fees from AdminaStar Federal’s 1-800 Medicare Help Line contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. During the fourth quarter of 2002, CMS awarded a new contract for this service to a competitor. The transition of this contract was substantially completed by June 30, 2003. Administrative fee increases were also partially offset by the termination of an East segment third party administrator arrangement in 2002. Other revenue, which is comprised principally of co-payments and deductibles associated with Anthem Prescription Management’s, or Anthem Prescription’s, sale of mail-order drugs, increased $38.9 million, or 45%, to $126.2 million in 2003. Anthem Prescription is our pharmacy benefit management company that provides its services principally to members of other Anthem affiliates. On a same-store basis, other revenue increased $34.2 million, or 42%, primarily due to additional mail-order prescription volume and increased prices of prescription drugs sold by Anthem Prescription. Increased mail-order prescription volume resulted from both membership increases and additional utilization of Anthem Prescription’s mail-order pharmacy. Benefit expense increased $2,424.5 million, or 25%, to $12,263.9 million in 2003. Included in these 2003 results was a $31.7 million net favorable prior year reserve development recorded during the second quarter of 2003, primarily in our Southeast and Midwest segments, and a $24.5 million favorable adjustment for resolution of a litigation matter in our Midwest segment in the first quarter of 2003. On a same-store basis, benefit expense increased $773.6 million, or 9%, to $9,523.6 million in 2003. Included in these same-store 2003 results was the recognition of a $24.5 million favorable adjustment for resolution of a litigation matter in our Midwest segment and a $15.9 million net favorable prior year reserve development recorded during the second quarter of 2003. Included in the same-store 2002 results was a $26.6 million net favorable prior year reserve development. Same-store benefit expense increased primarily due to increased cost of care, which was driven primarily by higher costs in professional services and outpatient services. See “Cost of Care—Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2002.” Our benefit expense ratio decreased 160 basis points from 82.4% in 2002 to 80.8% in 2003 due in part to the impact of our Trigon acquisition in 2002. On a same-store basis, our benefit expense ratio decreased 120 basis points to 81.4% in 2003, primarily due to lower than anticipated medical costs, the favorable resolution of litigation, disciplined pricing and mix of business shifts from fully-insured to self-funded arrangements by groups that have had historically higher loss ratios. Administrative expense increased $603.0 million, or 24%, to $3,109.6 million in 2003. Included in the 2003 results was a $10.0 million contribution to Anthem’s charitable foundation made by our Southeast segment and a $10.0 million contribution to Anthem’s charitable foundation made by our East segment. Included in the 2002 46 Table of Contents results was an unfavorable $23.0 million adjustment recorded to reflect the accrual of additional premium taxes in the state of Ohio and a $10.1 million reduction in the carrying value of our investment in MedUnite. On a same-store basis, administrative expense increased $160.8 million, or 7%, primarily due to increases in volume-sensitive costs such as higher commissions, premium taxes and other expenses associated with growth in our business and higher salary and benefits costs resulting from normal merit and benefit increases. On a same-store basis, our administrative expense ratio decreased 60 basis points to 18.9% in 2003, primarily due to our growth in operating revenue and the leveraging of costs over these higher revenues. Net investment income increased $17.4 million, or 7%, to $278.1 million in 2003. This increase in investment income primarily resulted from the investment of additional assets in 2003 from our Trigon acquisition and reinvestment of cash generated from operations, which were partially offset by a decrease in yields from new investments. A summary of our net realized gains on investments is as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2003 2002 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Net realized gains from the sale of fixed maturity securities $ 41.7 $ 32.9 $ 8.8 27 % Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities 0.5 0.6 (0.1 ) (17 ) Other-than-temporary impairments (24.4 ) (3.1 ) (21.3 ) 687 Net realized gains on investments $ 17.8 $ 30.4 $ (12.6 ) (41 )% Other-than-temporary impairments recognized in 2003 were substantially related to our equity investments, primarily due to the length of time that the securities’ fair value had been less than cost. As of December 31, 2003, our equity securities had gross unrealized gains of $26.2 million. In 2002, we recorded a $3.1 million other-than-temporary impairment on a limited partnership. During 2004, the Company began reallocating securities in its fixed maturity portfolio, primarily to optimize after tax investment income. This reallocation will result in realized gains and losses during 2004. Interest expense increased $32.7 million, or 33%, to $131.2 million in 2003, primarily resulting from additional interest expense incurred on the debt issued in conjunction with our Trigon acquisition. Interest expense on this debt was included for twelve months in 2003 and five months in 2002. Amortization of other intangible assets increased $17.4 million, or 58%, to $47.6 million in 2003, primarily due to additional amortization expense on intangible assets resulting from our Trigon acquisition. This amortization expense was included for twelve months in 2003 and five months in 2002. Income tax expense increased $184.9 million, or 72%, to $440.1 million in 2003, primarily due to increased income before taxes. In addition, our effective income tax rate increased to 36.1% in 2003 from 31.6% in 2002. This 450 basis point increase in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to the release of a deferred tax valuation allowance in 2002. Our current effective tax rate is more consistent with our expected rate on future earnings. Both basic and diluted net income per share for 2003 increased from 2002 primarily due to increased net income. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the number of weighted average shares primarily due to shares issued in connection with our Trigon acquisition outstanding for twelve months in 2003 and five months in 2002. Partially offsetting these increases in weighted average shares was our repurchase of shares of our common stock. 47 Table of Contents We use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, as described in FAS 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit and administrative expenses. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains on investments, gain (loss) on sale of subsidiary operations, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, income taxes and minority interest, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. For additional information, see Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 included in this Form 10-K. The discussions of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 presented below are based on operating gain and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Midwest Our Midwest segment is comprised of health benefit and related services for members in Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. Our Midwest segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2003 2002 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue $ 6,689.1 $ 6,051.4 $ 637.7 11 % Operating gain $ 441.0 $ 271.6 $ 169.4 62 % Operating margin 6.6 % 4.5 % 210 bp Membership (in 000s) 5,688 5,234 454 9 % Operating revenue increased $637.7 million, or 11%, to $6,689.1 million, primarily due to premium rate increases in our Local Large Group, Federal Employee Program and Small Group businesses. Also contributing to this growth were membership increases in our Individual and Small Group businesses. Operating revenue increases were partially offset by changes in the mix of our products with members selecting less rich benefit designs, resulting in lower priced products. Also offsetting the growth were shifts by certain National Accounts and Local Large Group customers to self-funded arrangements, resulting in lower revenues. Operating gain increased $169.4 million, or 62%, to $441.0 million, primarily due to improved underwriting results in our Medicare + Choice, Local Large Group and Small Group businesses, the recognition of a $24.5 million favorable adjustment for resolution of a litigation matter in the first quarter of 2003, and an unfavorable $23.0 million adjustment recorded in 2002 to reflect the accrual of additional premium taxes in the state of Ohio. Partially offsetting these improved results were lower operating gains recorded by our Individual business, primarily due to spending on systems to replace our claims, enrollment and customer service technology and members selecting Individual products with less rich benefit designs. Also included in our operating results were the recognition of a net favorable prior year reserve development of $12.5 million recorded during the second quarter of 2003 and a $15.7 million net favorable prior year reserve development in 2002. Membership increased 454,000, or 9%, to 5.7 million, primarily due to additional BlueCard activity and enrollment gains in our other National Accounts and Individual businesses. Individual sales benefited from a wider variety of product offerings. This membership increase included a shift in membership from fully-insured business to self-funded business, primarily due to group employers’ choosing self-funded insurance benefits in a weakening economy. 48 Table of Contents East Our East segment is comprised of health benefit and related services for members in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine. Our East segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2003 2002 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue $ 4,508.6 $ 4,151.5 $ 357.1 9 % Operating gain $ 290.0 $ 222.9 $ 67.1 30 % Operating margin 6.4 % 5.4 % 100 bp Membership (in 000s) 2,600 2,434 166 7 % Operating revenue increased $357.1 million, or 9%, to $4,508.6 million in 2003, primarily due to premium rate increases in our Local Large Group, Small Group and Federal Employee Program businesses. These increases were partially offset by the termination of a third party administrator arrangement in 2002 and changes in the mix of our products with members selecting less rich benefit designs, resulting in lower priced products. Also offsetting the growth were shifts by certain Local Large Group customers from fully insured to self-funding arrangements, resulting in lower revenues. Operating gain increased $67.1 million, or 30%, to $290.0 million in 2003, primarily due to improved underwriting results in our Local Large Group and Small Group businesses. Operating gain increases were partially offset by a $10.0 million contribution to Anthem’s charitable foundation during 2003. Membership increased 166,000, or 7%, primarily due to enrollment gains in our National Accounts business, including BlueCard activity. East membership also experienced a shift in membership from fully-insured business to self-funded business, primarily due to group employers’ choosing self-funded insurance benefits in a weakening economy. West Our West segment is comprised of health benefit and related services for members in Colorado and Nevada. Our West segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2003 2002 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue $ 1,039.0 $ 920.1 $ 118.9 13 % Operating gain $ 111.5 $ 74.7 $ 36.8 49 % Operating margin 10.7 % 8.1 % 260 bp Membership (in 000s) 939 836 103 12 % Operating revenue increased $118.9 million, or 13%, to $1,039.0 million in 2003, primarily due to higher premium rates in our Local Large Group and Small Group businesses. Also contributing to operating revenue growth was higher membership in our Individual and Federal Employee Program businesses. These increases were partially offset by the impact of decreases in membership in our Local Large Group and Small Group businesses. Operating gain increased $36.8 million, or 49%, to $111.5 million in 2003, primarily due to improved underwriting results in our Local Large Group and Individual businesses. Also contributing to the improvement 49 Table of Contents was a $10.1 million case-specific reserve established during the normal course of business during 2002 and a $6.3 million reduction of this reserve upon the resolution of this case in 2003. Partially offsetting these improvements to operating gain was a $10.9 million net favorable prior year reserve development recorded during the third quarter of 2002. Spending on our current claims, enrollment and customer service technology is expected to continue throughout 2004. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2003 we exited the Medicaid market in Nevada. As a result of these factors, operating gain and operating margins are expected to decline in 2004. Membership increased 103,000, or 12%, primarily due to increased BlueCard activity. Also impacting this membership growth were increases in our Individual and our other National Account businesses due to improved marketing efforts. Southeast Our Southeast segment is comprised of health benefit and related services for members in Virginia, excluding the immediate suburbs of Washington D.C. Our Southeast segment was established with the acquisition of Trigon on July 31, 2002. Results of operations for this segment have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning August 1, 2002. Our Southeast segment’s summarized results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the five months ended December 31, 2002 are as follows: Periods EndedDecember 31 2003 2002 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue $ 3,780.6 $ 1,467.9 NM NM Operating gain $ 335.6 $ 116.0 NM NM Operating margin 8.9 % 7.9 % 100 bp Membership (in 000s) 2,700 2,549 151 6 % The comparison of these two time periods is not meaningful as the period ended December 31, 2003 consists of twelve months of operating results while the period ended December 31, 2002 consists of five months of operating results. Operating revenue and operating gain for the year ended December 31, 2003 included issuance of premiums refunds to certain policyholders totaling $40.4 million, which partially offset our premium growth. These refunds were issued because claims costs in certain Southeast lines of business were much lower than expected. Also impacting 2003 operating gain was a $15.8 million net favorable prior year reserve development in the second quarter and a $10.0 million contribution to Anthem’s charitable foundation. Our integration activities remain on schedule, and we expect to achieve synergy savings in 2004 of at least $75.0 million. We achieved more than $60.0 million of synergy savings in 2003, primarily related to the reduction of corporate overhead and information technology costs as we integrated our Southeast segment. Membership increased 151,000, or 6%, to 2.7 million members in 2003, primarily due to increased BlueCard activity and increased membership in our other self-funded National Accounts business, reflecting the strength of the Blue Cross Blue Shield networks and distinctive customer service. Specialty Our Specialty segment includes our group life and disability insurance benefits, pharmacy benefit management, dental and vision administration services and behavioral health benefits services. On June 1, 2002, we created Anthem Behavioral Health, or ABH, by acquiring certain assets of PRO Behavioral Health, a Denver, 50 Table of Contents Colorado-based behavioral health company in order to broaden our specialty product offerings. Results from this acquisition are included from that date forward. Our Specialty segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2003 2002 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue $ 732.0 $ 523.5 $ 208.5 40 % Operating gain $ 69.1 $ 50.7 $ 18.4 36 % Operating margin 9.4 % 9.7 % (30 ) bp Operating revenue increased $208.5 million, or 40%, to $732.0 million in 2003, primarily due to increased mail-order prescription volume and increased wholesale drug costs which are passed through to our customers at Anthem Prescription, as well as the results of ABH, which evolved from our acquisition of PRO Behavioral Health on June 1, 2002. The increased mail-order prescription volume resulted from both membership increases and additional utilization of Anthem Prescription’s mail-order pharmacy option. For the year ended December 31, 2003, mail-order prescription volume increased 26% and retail prescription volume increased 12% compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Effective January 1, 2004, Anthem Prescription began to provide pharmacy benefit management services to our Southeast segment. Operating revenue from our behavioral health business is increasing as we begin to provide these services to more of our existing health membership. Operating gain increased $18.4 million, or 36%, to $69.1 million in 2003, primarily due to increased mail-order prescription volume. Improved behavioral health results due to additional revenues from existing Anthem health members who were converted to ABH during 2003 also contributed to Specialty’s increasing operating gains. These improvements in operating gain were partially offset by start-up and integration expenses associated with our dental and vision operations. Our Specialty segment will continue efforts to expand sales to our existing health membership in order to provide our members a wider range of cost effective products. These integration activities will occur over the next several years, and the related costs will partially offset future margin expansion in the Specialty segment as integration costs are incurred. Other Our Other segment includes administration of Medicare programs in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, Maine and New Hampshire; elimination of intersegment revenue and expenses; and corporate expenses not allocated to operating segments. Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2003 2002 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue from external customers $ 185.6 $ 178.2 $ 7.4 4 % Elimination of intersegment revenues (457.8 ) (302.1 ) (155.7 ) 52 % Total operating revenue (272.2 ) (123.9 ) (148.3 ) 120 % Operating loss (143.6 ) (91.4 ) (52.2 ) 57 % Operating revenue from external customers increased $7.4 million, or 4%, to $185.6 million in 2003, primarily due to cost reimbursement activity being reflected in our Medicare administration operations. This increase was partially offset by the loss of AdminaStar Federal’s 1-800 Medicare Help Line contract with CMS. During the fourth quarter of 2002, CMS awarded a new contract for this service to a competitor. The transition of 51 Table of Contents the contract was substantially completed by June 30, 2003. Elimination of intersegment revenues increased $155.7 million, or 52%, reflecting additional sales by Anthem Prescription to our health segments and sales between our health segments. Operating loss increased $52.2 million, or 57%, to $(143.6) million in 2003, primarily due to additional technology expenses, incentive compensation not allocated to the operating segments associated with better than expected performance and legal fees and expenses paid in 2003. Partially offsetting these operating loss increases was the reduction in our carrying value of our investment in MedUnite in 2002. VI. Membership—December 31, 2002 Compared to December 31, 2001 The following table presents our health membership by customer type, funding arrangement and segment as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, comparing total and same-store membership respectively. We define same-store membership as our membership at a given period end for a particular customer type, funding arrangement or in a segment after excluding the impact of members obtained through acquisitions or lost through dispositions during such period. We believe that same-store membership best captures the rate of organic growth of our operations period over period. The membership data presented is unaudited and in certain instances includes estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period, rounded to the nearest thousand.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, total membership increased approximately 3.2 million, or 40%, primarily due to our acquisition of Trigon, which became our Southeast segment. On a same-store basis, total membership increased 621,000, or 8%, primarily in National Accounts, Individual and Local Large Group businesses. The following discussion of membership changes between periods excludes our Southeast members, which are identified separately in the table above. 52 Table of Contents National Accounts membership increased 392,000, or 14%, primarily due to a significant increase in BlueCard activity. Individual membership increased 94,000, or 13%, with the majority of this growth resulting from higher sales in our under age 65 business in all segments due to the introduction of new, more affordable product designs and an overall increase in consumer awareness of our product offerings. Local Large Group membership increased 69,000, or 2%, primarily from sales to new fully-insured customers in our Midwest segment. In our Midwest segment, this growth was partially offset by a decrease in our self-funded business primarily as a result of pricing actions taken to better align our administrative fee revenue with costs of administering this business. Self-funded membership increased 399,000, or 10%, primarily due to an increase in National Accounts BlueCard activity. Fully-insured membership grew by 222,000 members, or 6%, primarily in our Individual and Local Large Group businesses, as explained above. VII. Cost of Care—Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2001 The following discussion summarizes our aggregate cost of care trends for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2002 compared to the 12-month period ended December 31, 2001, for our Local Large Group and Small Group fully-insured businesses only. Membership in these two customer groups represented approximately 61% of our premium income for the year ended December 31, 2002. Our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing the year over year change in average per member per month claim costs for which we are responsible, which excludes member co-payments and deductibles. Our cost of care trends as of December 31, 2002 are as follows: Cost of care trend Percent of costof care expense Aggregate 12 % 100 % Inpatient services 9 22 Outpatient services 12 24 Professional services 12 35 Pharmacy 16 19 Our aggregate cost of care trend for the rolling 12-month period ended December 31, 2002 was approximately 12%. This trend includes the Southeast segment, including information from the former Trigon for periods prior to our July 31, 2002 acquisition. Our aggregate cost of care trend excluding the impact of our Trigon acquisition was approximately one-half percentage point higher, driven primarily by increased professional services costs and outpatient services costs. Inpatient services costs increased approximately 9% including the impact of our Trigon acquisition for both rolling 12-month periods, including periods prior to our July 31, 2002 acquisition. Excluding the impact of our Trigon acquisition, our inpatient services trend was approximately one percentage point lower. Approximately two thirds of this trend resulted from unit cost increases and approximately one third of this trend resulted from utilization increases. The unit cost trend was primarily due to a health care industry shift of lower-cost procedures to outpatient settings, leaving more expensive procedures performed in inpatient settings. In addition, growth in inpatient trend was due to implementation of new provider contracts that reflect the hospital industry’s more aggressive stance in their contracting with health benefit companies. Utilization increases resulted primarily from increases in the frequency of inpatient surgeries. We are implementing advanced care management programs and disease management programs which have shown to reduce deterioration in health and the need for hospitalization. As a result of these programs, hospital utilization has been essentially stable. 53 Table of Contents Cost increases for outpatient services were approximately 12% including the impact of our Trigon acquisition for both rolling 12-month periods, including periods prior to our July 31, 2002 acquisition. Excluding the impact of our Trigon acquisition, our outpatient services trend was approximately one percentage point higher. Drivers of this outpatient trend include a continuing shift of certain procedures such as certain cardiac care procedures previously performed in an inpatient setting to an outpatient setting and increased cost of emergency room services as more procedures are being performed at each emergency room visit. Costs are also increasing for outpatient surgery and radiology services. Cost increases for professional services were approximately 12% including the impact of our Trigon acquisition for both rolling 12-month periods, including periods prior to our July 31, 2002 acquisition. Excluding the impact of our Trigon acquisition, our professional services trend was approximately one and one-half percentage points higher. This trend is due to both higher utilization and higher unit costs. Utilization increases were driven primarily by increases in physician office visits, radiology procedures such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging procedures, or MRIs, Positron Emission Tomography procedures, or PET scans, and laboratory procedures. Unit cost increases were driven primarily by increases in physician fee reimbursement schedules. In response to increasing professional services costs, we continue to work with our providers through education and contracting to ensure that our members receive the most appropriate care at the proper time in the appropriate clinical setting. Pharmacy costs increased by approximately 16% including the impact of our Trigon acquisition for both rolling 12-month periods, including periods prior to our July 31, 2002 acquisition. Excluding the impact of our Trigon acquisition, our pharmacy cost trend remained consistent at approximately 16%. Increases were primarily due to the introduction of new, higher cost drugs and higher overall utilization as a result of increases in direct-to-consumer advertising by pharmaceutical companies and expanded physician-prescribed use of drugs that manage chronic conditions such as high cholesterol. In response to increasing pharmacy costs, we are evaluating different plan designs, recontracting with retail pharmacies and continuing the implementation of tiered drug benefits for our members. Three-tier drug programs reflect benefit designs that have three different co-payment levels, which depend on the drug selected. Generic drugs have the lowest co-payment, brand name drugs included in the drug formulary have a higher co-payment and brand name drugs omitted from the drug formulary have the highest co-payment. Drug formularies are lists of prescription drugs that have been reviewed and selected for their quality and effectiveness by a committee of community-based practicing physicians and clinical pharmacists. Through our pharmacy benefit design, we encourage use of these formulary listed brand name and generic drugs to ensure members receive quality and cost-effective medication. The favorable impact of three-tier drug programs on prescription drug cost trends is most significant in the first year of implementation. Excluding Southeast membership, we have already implemented three-tier drug programs for approximately 66% of our members as of December 31, 2002, as compared to approximately 60% of our members as of December 31, 2001. 54 Table of Contents VIII. Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2001 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: Years Ended December 31 Change 2002 2001 $ % ($ in Millions, Except Per Share Data) Premiums $ 11,941.0 $ 9,244.8 $ 2,696.2 29 % Administrative fees 962.2 817.3 144.9 18 Other revenue 87.3 58.2 29.1 50 Total operating revenue 1 12,990.5 10,120.3 2,870.2 28 Net investment income 260.7 238.6 22.1 9 Net realized gains on investments 30.4 60.8 (30.4 ) (50 ) Gain on sale of subsidiary operations 0.7 25.0 (24.3 ) (97 ) Total revenue 13,282.3 10,444.7 2,837.6 27 % Benefit expense 9,839.4 7,814.7 2,024.7 26 Administrative expense 2,506.6 1,986.1 520.5 26 Interest expense 98.5 60.2 38.3 64 Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 30.2 31.5 (1.3 ) (4 ) Demutualization expenses — 27.6 (27.6 ) NM2 Total expenses 12,474.7 9,920.1 2,554.6 26 Income before taxes and minority interest 807.6 524.6 283.0 54 Income taxes 255.2 183.4 71.8 39 Minority interest (credit) 3.3 (1.0 ) 4.3 NM2 Net income $ 549.1 $ 342.2 $ 206.9 60 % Average basic shares outstanding (in millions) 8 119.0 103.3 15.7 15 % Average diluted shares outstanding (in millions) 8 121.8 103.8 18.0 17 Basic net income per share 8 $ 4.61 $ 3.31 $ 1.30 39 Diluted net income per share 8 $ 4.51 $ 3.30 $ 1.21 37 % Benefit expense ratio 3 82.4 % 84.5 % (210 ) bp 4 Administrative expense ratio 5 19.3 % 19.6 % (30 ) bp 4 Income before taxes and minority interest as a percentage of total revenue 6 6.1 % 5.0 % 110 bp 4 Net income as a percentage of total revenue 7 4.1 % 3.3 % 80 bp 4 1 Premium equivalents, which are not revenue, are measures of the amount of claims attributable to non-Medicare, self-funded health business where we provide a complete array of customer service, claims administration, billing and enrollment services, but the customer retains the risk of funding payments for health benefits provided to members. We add premium equivalents to operating revenue to allow for a comparison of business volume among companies with differing levels of revenues from fully-insured and self-funded businesses. We believe operating revenue and premium equivalents is a useful analytical measure because it eliminates fluctuations in operating revenue caused by changes in the mix of fully-insured and self-funded business. Premium equivalents, which are not included in operating revenue above, for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $5,271.0 million (including $730.7 million from our Southeast segment) and for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $3,937.1 million. 8 December 31, 2001 amounts include pro forma earnings per share for the period prior to our initial public offering. See Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 included in Part II, Item 8 of this 10-K. 55 Table of Contents For the remaining footnote explanations, see “Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2002” table. On May 31, 2001, we sold our TRICARE operations, resulting in a gain of $25.0 million. The results of our TRICARE operations were reported in our Other segment during 2001 and included $263.2 million in operating revenue and $4.2 million in operating gain for the five months ended May 31, 2001. Throughout the following discussion of our results of operations, “same-store” excludes our TRICARE operations from 2001 and the operating results of our Southeast segment, which was formed following our Trigon acquisition, from the date of purchase in 2002. Premiums increased $2,696.2 million, or 29%, to $11,941.0 million in 2002. On a same-store basis, premiums increased $1,543.1 million, or 17%, due to premium rate increases and growth in our fully-insured membership. Our premium yields, net of benefit buy-downs for our fully-insured Local Large Group and Small Group businesses, increased approximately 14% on a rolling 12-month basis as of December 31, 2002, both on a same-store basis and after including Southeast premiums. Also contributing to premium growth was higher fully-insured membership in all of our business segments. Administrative fees increased $144.9 million, or 18%, including administrative fees following Trigon’s acquisition date in 2002. On a same-store basis, administrative fees increased $98.2 million, or 13%, primarily due to increased BlueCard activity and increased administrative fees from AdminaStar Federal’s 1-800 Medicare Help Line contract with CMS. During the fourth quarter of 2002, CMS awarded a new contract for this service to a competitor. The transition of this contract was substantially completed by June 30, 2003. On a same-store basis, other revenue, which is comprised principally of co-payments and deductibles associated with Anthem Prescription’s sale of mail-order drugs, increased $24.2 million, or 42%. Mail-order revenues increased primarily due to additional volume. Anthem Prescription launched mail conversion campaigns to inform members of the benefits and convenience of using Anthem Prescription’s mail-order pharmacy option during 2002. In addition, Anthem Prescription increased its penetration of our health benefits membership, with a resulting larger enrollment base and therefore greater demand for mail-order service. Benefit expense increased $2,024.7 million, or 26%, in 2002. On a same-store basis, benefit expense increased $1,132.7 million, or 15%, primarily due to increased cost of care trends and higher average membership. Higher costs of care were driven primarily by higher costs in professional services and outpatient services. See “Cost of Care—Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2001.” Our benefit expense ratio decreased 210 basis points from 84.5% in 2001 to 82.4% in 2002 due partly to the sale of our TRICARE operations in 2001 and the impact of our Trigon acquisition in 2002. On a same-store basis, our benefit expense ratio decreased 160 basis points from 84.2% in 2001 to 82.6% in 2002, primarily due to lower than anticipated medical costs in all of our business segments. Our 2002 benefit expense was also reduced by net favorable developments of prior year reserves reported as of December 31, 2001. Administrative expense increased $520.5 million, or 26%, in 2002. On a same-store basis, administrative expense increased $319.6 million, or 17%, primarily due to higher salary cost and merit increases, other volume sensitive costs such as higher commissions and premium taxes and higher incentive compensation costs associated with above targeted results. On a same-store basis, our administrative expense ratio remained consistent with 2001 at 19.5%. Net investment income increased $22.1 million, or 9%. This increase in investment income primarily resulted from the investment of additional assets in 2002 from our Trigon acquisition, which was partially offset by decreased average yield from investment securities. Also contributing to the increase was the impact of an increased allocation of fixed maturity securities as a percentage of our investment portfolio during the third quarter of 2001. 56 Table of Contents A summary of our net realized gains on investments is as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2002 2001 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Net realized gains from the sale of fixed maturity securities $ 32.9 $ 20.7 $ 12.2 59 % Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities 0.6 69.0 (68.4 ) (99 ) Other-than-temporary impairments (3.1 ) (28.9 ) 25.8 89 Net realized gains on investments $ 30.4 $ 60.8 $ (30.4 ) (50 )% Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities decreased $68.4 million primarily due to our realization of $65.2 million of gains in 2001 resulting from the restructuring of our portfolio. In 2002, we realized a $3.1 million loss on a limited partnership, and in 2001 we recognized $28.9 million of impairment losses on equity securities. Interest expense increased $38.3 million, or 64%, primarily reflecting additional interest expense incurred on the debt issued in conjunction with our Trigon acquisition and the issuance of our 6.00% Equity Security Units on November 2, 2001. Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets decreased $1.3 million. Due to our adoption of FAS 142 on January 1, 2002, amortization decreased approximately $17.5 million. This decrease was partially offset by $16.2 million of new amortization expense, including $15.8 million of amortization expense on intangible assets resulting from our Trigon acquisition. See Notes 2 and 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K for additional information concerning our adoption of FAS 142. Income tax expense increased $71.8 million, or 39%, primarily due to increased income before taxes. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 31.6% in 2002 from 35.0% in 2001. This 340 basis point decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to the reduction of a deferred tax valuation allowance in 2002 due to our continued improvement in taxable earnings, nondeductible demutualization expenses incurred during 2001 and the impact of FAS 142. Net income increased $206.9 million, or 60%, primarily due to our Trigon acquisition, the improvement in our operating results in each health business segment as described below, higher net investment income, lower amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from the adoption of FAS 142 on January 1, 2002 and our reduced effective tax rate. Assuming FAS 142 had been in effect for the year ended December 31, 2001, our net income would have increased $191.8 million, or 54%. Both basic and fully diluted earnings per share increased as a result of increased net income as described above and the impact of our stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program in 2002. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the number of average shares outstanding due to the stock issued in conjunction with our Trigon acquisition on July 31, 2002, and an increase in the effect of dilutive securities. We use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, as described in FAS 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit and administrative expenses. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains on investments, gain on sale of subsidiary operations, interest expense, amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, demutualization expenses, income taxes and minority interest (credit), as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. For additional information, see Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the 57 Table of Contents years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 included in this Form 10-K. The discussions of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 presented below are based on operating gain and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Midwest Our Midwest segment is comprised of health benefit and related services for members in Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. Our Midwest segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2002 2001 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue $ 6,051.4 $ 5,093.0 $ 958.4 19 % Operating gain $ 271.6 $ 161.5 $ 110.1 68 % Operating margin 4.5 % 3.2 % 130 bp Membership (in 000s) 5,234 4,854 380 8 % Operating revenue increased $958.4 million, or 19%, primarily due to premium rate increases in our Local Large Group and Small Group businesses and membership increases in our Local Large Group fully-insured and Individual businesses. Operating gain increased $110.1 million, or 68%, primarily due to improved underwriting results in our Local Large Group fully-insured and Small Group businesses. Our operating gain was also impacted by the recognition of a $15.7 million net favorable prior year reserve development recognized in the third quarter of 2002 and an $11.2 million strengthening of reserves during the third quarter of 2001. Operating gain improvements were partially offset by a $23.0 million unfavorable adjustment recorded during 2002 to reflect the accrual of additional premium taxes in the state of Ohio. Membership increased 380,000, or 8%, primarily due to additional BlueCard activity and enrollment gains in our Local Large Group fully-insured and Individual businesses. Individual sales benefited from the introduction of new, lower premium products. Our Midwest segment experienced a decrease in Local Large Group self-funded membership, which was anticipated and was a result of pricing actions designed to better align revenue with costs of services to this membership class. East Our East segment is comprised of health benefit and related services for members in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine. Our East segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: Years Ended December 31 2002 2001 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue $ 4,151.5 $ 3,667.3 $ 484.2 13 % Operating gain $ 222.9 $ 128.8 $ 94.1 73 % Operating margin 5.4 % 3.5 % 190 bp Membership (in 000s) 2,434 2,260 174 8 % Operating revenue increased $484.2 million, or 13%, primarily due to premium rate increases, particularly in our Local Large Group and Small Group businesses. 58 Table of Contents Operating gain increased $94.1 million, or 73%, primarily due to improved underwriting results, particularly in our Individual and Local Large Group businesses, and an unfavorable reserve strengthening adjustment of $9.4 million recorded during the third quarter of 2001. Membership increased 174,000, or 8%, primarily due to increased BlueCard activity and enrollment gains in our Local Large Group self-funded business. Our growth in Local Large Group self-funded business primarily resulted from changes in our Local Large Group mix of business from fully-insured to self-funded. On February 28, 2002, a subsidiary of Anthem Insurance, Anthem Health Plans of Maine, Inc., completed its purchase of the remaining 50% ownership interest in Maine Partners Health Plan, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of $10.6 million. We had previously consolidated the financial results of this entity in our consolidated financial statements and recorded minority interest for the percentage we did not own. West Our West segment is comprised of health benefit and related services for members in Colorado and Nevada. Our West segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2002 2001 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue $ 920.1 $ 774.4 $ 145.7 19 % Operating gain $ 74.7 $ 20.1 $ 54.6 272 % Operating margin 8.1 % 2.6 % 550 bp Membership (in 000s) 836 769 67 9 % Operating revenue increased by $145.7 million, or 19%, primarily due to higher premium rates particularly in our Local Large Group fully-insured and Small Group businesses, and higher membership in our Individual business. Operating gain increased $54.6 million to $74.7 million in 2002, primarily due to improved underwriting results in our Local Large Group fully-insured and Small Group businesses. Also contributing to the improvement was a $10.9 million net favorable prior year reserve development recorded during the third quarter of 2002. These reserve releases were offset by a $10.1 million reserve increase for case specific reserves incurred during the normal course of business in 2002. Membership increased 67,000, or 9%, primarily due to increased BlueCard activity and higher sales in our Individual business. Southeast Our Southeast segment is comprised of health benefit and related services for members in Virginia, excluding the immediate suburbs of Washington D.C. Our Southeast segment’s summarized results of operations for the five months ended December 31, 2002 are as follows: Five Months EndedDecember 31, 2002 ($ in Millions) Operating revenue $ 1,467.9 Operating gain $ 116.0 Operating margin 7.9 % Membership (in 000s) 2,549 59 Table of Contents Our Southeast segment was established with the acquisition of Trigon on July 31, 2002. Results of operations for this segment have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning August 1, 2002. These five months of operating results may not be sustainable or indicative of future performance, as we were in the early stages of transitioning business practices and policies. We captured approximately $11.0 million of synergies in 2002, primarily related to corporate overhead and information technology cost savings. Specialty Our Specialty segment includes our group life and disability insurance benefits, pharmacy benefit management, dental and vision administration services and behavioral health benefits services. During the third quarter of 2002, we sold our third party occupational health services businesses, the operating results of which were not material to the earnings of this segment or our consolidated results. On June 1, 2002, we acquired certain assets of PRO Behavioral Health, a Denver, Colorado-based behavioral health company in order to broaden our specialty product offerings. Results from this acquisition are included from that date forward and are not material to the operating revenue or operating gain of this segment in the year ended December 31, 2002. Our Specialty segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2002 2001 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue $ 523.5 $ 396.1 $ 127.4 32 % Operating gain $ 50.7 $ 32.9 $ 17.8 54 % Operating margin 9.7 % 8.3 % 140 bp Operating revenue increased $127.4 million, or 32%, primarily due to increased mail-order prescription volume at Anthem Prescription, which launched mail-order campaigns to inform members of the benefits and convenience of using Anthem Prescription’s mail-order pharmacy option for maintenance drugs. In addition, Anthem Prescription increased its penetration of our health benefits members. Anthem Prescription implemented its pharmacy benefit programs in our West segment and in Maine during the first six months of 2001. Excluding the impact of our TRICARE operations, mail-service prescription volume increased 29% and retail prescription volume increased 10%. Operating gain increased $17.8 million, or 54%, primarily due to increased mail-order prescription volume and additional margin resulting from further penetration of generic drug prescriptions at Anthem Prescription. Improved results in the life and dental businesses also contributed to the growth in operating gain, which was modestly offset by start-up and integration expenses associated with our behavioral health, vision and dental operations. 60 Table of Contents Other Our Other segment includes administration of Medicare programs in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, Maine and New Hampshire; elimination of intersegment revenue and expenses; and corporate expenses not allocated to operating segments. In 2001, our Other segment also contained Anthem Alliance, a subsidiary that provided the health care benefits and administration in nine states for active and retired military employees and their dependents under the Department of Defense’s TRICARE program for military families. Our TRICARE operations were sold on May 31, 2001. Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2002 2001 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue from external customers $ 178.2 $ 403.5 $ (225.3 ) (56 )% Elimination of intersegment revenues (302.1 ) (214.0 ) (88.1 ) 41 % Total operating revenue (123.9 ) 189.5 (313.4 ) (165 )% Operating loss (91.4 ) (23.8 ) (67.6 ) 284 % Operating revenue from external customers decreased $225.3 million, or 56%, primarily due to the sale of our TRICARE operations. Excluding our TRICARE operations from 2001, operating revenue from external customers increased $37.9 million, or 27%, primarily due to revenue from our AdminaStar Federal’s 1-800 Medicare Help Line contract with CMS. During the fourth quarter of 2002, CMS awarded a new contract for this service to a competitor. The transition of the contract was substantially completed by June 30, 2003. Operating loss increased $67.6 million primarily due to higher unallocated corporate expenses and the absence of TRICARE operating gain. These unallocated expenses accounted for $91.3 million in 2002 and $33.0 million in 2001. This increase in unallocated corporate expenses was primarily related to higher incentive compensation costs associated with better than expected operating results. Also contributing to this increased operating loss was the reduction in our carrying value of our investment in MedUnite. IX. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this Management’s Discussion and Analysis. We consider some of our most important accounting policies that require estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for unpaid life, accident and health claims, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our significant accounting policies are also summarized in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Liability for Unpaid Life, Accident and Health Claims The most significant accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for unpaid life, accident and health claims. At December 31, 2003, this liability was $1,866.8 million and represented 25% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for pending claims and claims that are incurred but not reported, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Pending claims are those received by us but not yet processed through our systems. Liabilities for both incurred but not reported and reported but not yet paid claims are determined for each of our business segments employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. These Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be adequate under moderately 61 Table of Contents adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not reported claims for each of our business segments by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical data of paid claims is formatted into claim triangles which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. Actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months, the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based upon recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or “trend factors”. Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns and claim submission patterns. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based upon subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In the actuarial process, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated, but rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense. In addition to the pending claims and incurred but not reported claims, the liability for unpaid life, accident and health claims includes reserves for premium deficiencies. Premium deficiencies are recognized when it is probable that expected claims and loss adjustment expenses will exceed future premiums on existing health and other insurance contracts without consideration of investment income. For purposes of premium deficiencies, contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. Management regularly reviews its assumptions regarding our claims liabilities and makes adjustments to benefit expense recorded, when necessary. If it is determined that management’s assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claims liabilities occur each quarter and are sometimes significant as compared to the total benefit expense recorded in that quarter. Prior year development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior year liability is no longer needed or that additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is accurate and will not fluctuate significantly with future development. 62 Table of Contents As described above, the completion factors and trend factors can have a significant impact on the claim liability. The following example provides the estimated impact to our December 31, 2003 unpaid claims liability assuming hypothetical changes in the completion and trend factors: Completion Factor1 Claims Trend Factor2 (Decrease) Increasein CompletionFactor Increase (Decrease)in Unpaid ClaimsLiabilities (Decrease) Increasein Claim TrendFactor (Decrease) Increasein Unpaid ClaimsLiabilities ($ in Millions) ($ in Millions) (3 )% $ 136.0 (3 )% $ (23.0 ) (2 )% 90.0 (2 )% (15.0 ) (1 )% 45.0 (1 )% (8.0 ) 1 % (44.0 ) 1 % 8.0 2 % (87.0 ) 2 % 15.0 3 % (129.0 ) 3 % 23.0 1 Assumes (decrease) increase in the completion factors for the most recent four months 2 Assumes (decrease) increase in the claims trend factors for the most recent two months In addition, assuming a hypothetical 1% total difference between our December 31, 2003 estimated claims liability and the actual claims paid, net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 would increase or decrease by $12.1 million while basic net income per share would increase or decrease by $0.09 per share and diluted net income per share would increase or decrease by $0.08 per share. Note 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K provides historical information regarding the accrual and payment of our unpaid claims liability. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements, the line labeled “incurred related to prior years” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “incurred related to prior years” claims may be offset as we establish the estimate of “incurred related to current year”. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. Thus, only when the release of a prior year reserve is not offset with the same level of conservatism in estimating the current year reserve will the redundancy create a net reduction in current benefit expense. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business. We believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for unpaid claims liability at each reporting date. 63 Table of Contents The reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for unpaid life, accident and health claims for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, as presented in Note 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements is as follows: (In Millions) 2003 2002 2001 Balances at January 1, net of reinsurance $ 1,821.2 $ 1,352.7 $ 1,382.1 Business purchases, divestitures and purchase adjustments (20.6 ) 379.4 (139.1 ) Incurred related to: Current year 12,462.3 9,965.1 7,843.1 Prior years (226.1 ) (150.7 ) (96.4 ) Total incurred 12,236.2 9,814.4 7,746.7 Paid related to: Current year 10,685.4 8,396.4 6,521.5 Prior years 1,495.0 1,328.9 1,115.5 Total paid 12,180.4 9,725.3 7,637.0 Balances at December 31, net of reinsurance 1,856.4 1,821.2 1,352.7 Reinsurance recoverables at December 31 10.4 4.8 7.6 Reserve gross of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid claims atDecember 31 $ 1,866.8 $ 1,826.0 $ 1,360.3 Amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled. Liabilities at any year end are continually reviewed and re-estimated as information regarding actual claims payments, or runout, becomes known. This information is compared to the originally established year end liability. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated. The redundancy of $226.1 million shown in the table above and in Note 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003, represents an estimate based on paid claim activity from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2003. Medical claim liabilities are usually described as having a “short tail”, which means that they are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the majority, or approximately 90%, of the $226.1 million redundancy relates to claims incurred in calendar year 2002, with the remaining 10% related to claims incurred in 2001 and prior. We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current period to total incurred claims recorded in each prior year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. This metric was 2.3% for 2003, 1.9% for 2002 and 1.5% for 2001. Having only five months of incurred claims for our Southeast segment during 2002 impacted the ratio for 2003. Had the Southeast segment been included for the full year 2002, the ratio would have been approximately 2.0%. A review of the current year paid indicates that the amount of claims paid in the current year as a percentage of incurred related to current year has increased. This ratio was 85.7% for 2003, 84.3% for 2002 and 83.1% for 2001. The increase is primarily attributable to our implementation of new systems and improved electronic connectivity with our networks. The result is our ability to adjudicate and pay claims quicker. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This standard requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time 64 Table of Contents the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgement is required in making this analysis. At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the key elements that follow: • the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset; • the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim; • the forecasted future taxable income and therefore likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and • any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences. During 2003, we utilized additional alternative minimum tax, or AMT, credits and net operating losses on our federal tax return for which we had a deferred tax asset with a corresponding valuation allowance. As deferred tax assets related to those deductions are recognized in the tax return, a valuation allowance is no longer required and is reduced. While the valuation allowance decreased $81.9 million, we recorded additional deferred tax liabilities of $81.9 million for uncertainty on several tax items. These items include uncertainty arising from the lack of clear guidance from the Internal Revenue Service on various tax issues relating to our conversion in 1987 from tax exempt to tax paying status. During 2002, based on our assessments of the valuation allowance it was determined that the only items that require a valuation allowance are those that relate to specific deferred tax temporary differences as opposed to those that relate to the anticipation of future taxable income. This determination was due to the levels of taxable income reported on our 2001 tax return, income generated during 2002 and taxable income expected in future periods. As a result of this determination, during 2002, we reduced our valuation allowance. The net decrease in the valuation allowance for 2002 was $112.4 million. During 2002, $18.0 million of the change in the valuation allowance was recorded as a reduction to goodwill. This adjustment resulted from recognition of deferred tax assets previously determined to be unrealizable. Because of uncertainties noted above regarding both the timing and the amount of deductions, we recorded a $57.2 million deferred tax liability. We also recorded a reduction to income tax expense of $37.2 million. This reduction contributed to a reduced effective tax rate of 31.6% for the year ended December 31, 2002. We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with our various filing positions, we record additional tax liability for potential adverse tax outcomes that we judge to be appropriate. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for possible exposures. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted. As of December 31, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service continues its examination of two of our five open tax years. For additional information, see Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2003 was $2,450.1 million and intangible assets were $1,227.0 million. The sum of goodwill and intangible assets represented 27% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2003. 65 Table of Contents On January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and Statement of Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FAS 141 requires business combinations completed after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. It also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under FAS 142, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually. We completed our annual impairment test of existing goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) for the year ended December 31, 2003 during the fourth quarter of 2003. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2002, we completed our transitional impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) during the second quarter of 2002 and our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2002. Based upon these tests we have not incurred any impairment losses related to any goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives). On July 31, 2002, we completed our purchase of 100% of the outstanding stock of Trigon. In accordance with FAS 141, we allocated the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed. This allocation process included the review of relevant information about the assets and liabilities, independent appraisals and other valuations to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation resulted in $2,146.1 million of non-tax deductible goodwill and $1,172.7 million of acquired intangible assets. While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, the annual impairment testing required under FAS 142 requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our goodwill and intangibles. Such assumptions include the discount factor used to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, which is ultimately used to identify potential goodwill impairment. Such estimated fair values might produce significantly different results if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. Because of the amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet, the impairment analysis is significant. If we are unable to support a fair value estimate in future annual goodwill impairment tests or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income. For additional information, see Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. Investments Total investment securities were $6,915.2 million at December 31, 2003 and represented 51% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2003. Our fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as “available-for-sale” securities and are reported at fair value. We have determined that all investments in our portfolio are available to support current operations, and accordingly, have classified such securities as current assets. Investment income is recorded when earned, and realized gains or losses, determined by specific identification of investments sold, are included in income when the securities are sold. An impairment review of securities to determine if declines in fair value are other-than-temporary is subjective and requires a high degree of judgement. We evaluate our investment securities on a quarterly basis, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. If any declines are determined to be other than temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made. The current economic environment and recent 66 Table of Contents volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment. The same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. During the three months ended June 30, 2003, we recorded a $22.3 million charge for other-than-temporary impairment of our equity securities, primarily due to the length of time that the securities’ fair value had been less than cost. An additional $2.1 million impairment loss was recorded for investments in certain other restricted assets and joint ventures. Our equity securities, which are comprised of indexed mutual funds, had gross unrealized gains of $26.2 million at December 31, 2003. Management believes it has adequately reviewed for impairment and that its investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change management’s judgment regarding impairment. This could result in realized losses relating to other-than-temporary declines being charged against future income. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $276.0 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $249.9 million increase in fair value. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $19.4 million. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $19.4 million. A summary of investments with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2003 along with the related fair value, aggregated by the length of time that investments have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, is as follows: Less than TwelveMonths Twelve Months orMore Total (In Millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fixed maturity securities: United States Government securities $ 172.4 $ 1.8 $ 3.6 $ 0.2 $ 176.0 $ 2.0 Obligations of states and political subdivisions — — — — — — Corporate securities 404.1 5.0 — — 404.1 5.0 Mortgage-backed securities 562.9 6.6 — — 562.9 6.6 Total fixed maturity securities 1,139.4 13.4 3.6 0.2 1,143.0 13.6 Equity securities—indexed mutual funds — — — — — — Total $ 1,139.4 $ 13.4 $ 3.6 $ 0.2 $ 1,143.0 $ 13.6 The Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, which impact the fair value of individual securities. All unrealized losses reported above were caused by the effect of a rising interest rate environment on certain securities with stated interest rates currently below market rates. The Company has the ability and intent to hold these securities until their full cost can be recovered. Therefore, the Company does not believe the unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment as of December 31, 2003. Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. Our primary objective is the preservation of the asset base and maximization of portfolio income given an acceptable level of risk. We manage the market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits of investments in individual issuers. If we are unable to effectively manage these risks, it could have an impact on our future earnings and financial position. 67 Table of Contents For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. Retirement Benefits Pension Benefits We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our employees, and account for these plans in accordance with FAS 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by FAS 87, we calculate the value of plan assets (described below). Further, the effects on our computation of pension expense from the performance of the pension plans’ assets and changes in pension liabilities are amortized over future periods. An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our September 30, 2003 measurement date, we lowered our expected rate of return on plan assets to 8.00% (from 8.50% for 2003 expense recognition). We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. The expected long-term rate of return is calculated by the geometric averaging method, which calculates an expected multi-period return. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase. This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years. This produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our measurement date. At our last measurement date (September 30, 2003), we selected a discount rate of 6.25%, which was developed using a benchmark rate of the Moody’s Aa Corporate Bonds index. Changes in the discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension expense, and the net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FAS 87. In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities and equity securities maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. Plan assets are not invested in Anthem stock. As of our measurement date of September 30, 2003, we had approximately 66% of plan assets invested in equity securities, 31% in fixed maturity securities and 3% in other assets. At December 31, 2003, our consolidated prepaid pension asset was $258.3 million, an increase from $146.2 million at December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily due to the funding of our cash balance pension plans in the amount of $115.0 million during 2003. For the year ending December 31, 2004, the Company does not expect any required contributions under ERISA. The Company may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we recognized consolidated pretax pension expense of $21.3 million, $14.3 million and $10.5 million, respectively. 68 Table of Contents Other Postretirement Benefits We provide most employees certain life, medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions including a discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits. We recognized a postretirement benefit liability of $188.4 million at December 31, 2003. At our last measurement date (September 30, 2003), we selected a discount rate of 6.25%, which was developed using a benchmark rate of the Moody’s Aa Corporate Bonds index. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of other benefits at the measurement date are as follows: 2003 2002 Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 11.00 % 10.00 % Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate) 5.50 % 5.00 % Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2009 2007 See “New Accounting Pronouncements” below for discussion of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position 106-1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. For additional information regarding Retirement Benefits, see Note 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. New Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2003, we adopted the interim reporting requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation–Transition and Disclosure (“FAS 148”). FAS 148 requires more prominent disclosure and specifies the form, content and location of these disclosures in both our annual and interim financial statements. Adoption of this statement had no impact on our financial position or results of operations, as we continue to account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for the disclosures required by FAS 148. On November 12, 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, as part of its discussion surrounding EITF Issue No. 03-01, The Meaning of Other-than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments, reached a consensus to require certain year end quantitative and qualitative disclosures about the unrealized losses from debt and equity securities, and management’s conclusion that any impairment is temporary. The required disclosures are required to include quantitative information about (1) the aggregate amount of unrealized losses and (2) the aggregate related fair values of investments with unrealized losses, summarized by the time period during which the investment has been in an unrealized loss position. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments” above and Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for these required disclosures. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 became law in December 2003 and expanded Medicare, primarily adding a prescription drug benefit for Medicare-eligible retirees starting in 2006. The Company anticipates that the benefits it pays in 2006 and beyond will be lower as a result of the new Medicare provisions. However, the retiree medical obligations and costs reported in the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K do not reflect the impact of this legislation. As 69 Table of Contents permitted by Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position 106-1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, the Company has deferred the recognition of the impact of the new Medicare provisions due to open questions about some of the new Medicare provisions and a lack of authoritative accounting guidance about certain matters. The final accounting guidance could require changes to previously reported information. See Note 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding our retiree obligations for life, medical, vision and dental benefits. On December 23, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a revised version of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132, Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits (“FAS 132”). The revised standard did not impact our financial position or results of operations as it did not change the methodologies underlying the measurement of obligations or calculation of pension expense, but makes significant changes to the required disclosures in the financial statements. We adopted the new reporting requirements in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003. See Note 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for the disclosures required by FAS 132, as revised. There were no other new accounting pronouncements issued during 2003 that had a material impact on our financial position, operating results or disclosures. X. Liquidity and Capital Resources Introduction Our cash receipts consist primarily of premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue and proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchase of investment securities, interest expense, payments on long term borrowings, capital expenditures and repurchase of our common stock. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. As such, any future decline in our profitability would likely have some negative impact on our liquidity. We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy. A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities, to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are available for sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Excess capital is paid annually in the form of dividends by subsidiaries to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. We have access to a $1.0 billion commercial paper program supported by $1.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, which allow us to maintain further operating and financial flexibility. Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 During 2003, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,143.4 million, as compared to $991.1 million in 2002, an increase of $152.3 million. The increase resulted from improved net income, including the impact of our Trigon acquisition, offset by a decline in operating cash flow from our operating assets and 70 Table of Contents liabilities. The decline in cash from operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from increases in receivables resulting from growth in our revenue base, payment for resolution of a litigation matter and higher incentive payments during 2003 as compared to 2002. Net cash flow used in investing activities was $1,113.6 million in 2003, compared to cash used of $1,411.9 million in 2002, a decrease in cash used of $298.3 million. The table below outlines the changes in investing cash flow between the two years (in millions): Increase in net purchases of investments $ 492.1 Decrease in net purchases and sales of subsidiaries (782.1 ) Decrease in net purchases and proceeds from sale of property and equipment (8.3 ) Total decrease in cash used in investing activities $ (298.3 ) The purchase of investment securities increased as operating cash was moved into our investment portfolio and cash balances held by our investment managers was reduced. The decrease in subsidiary purchases resulted primarily from minimal activity in 2003 versus 2002, which included our Trigon acquisition. The decrease in net property and equipment purchases was nominal. Net cash flow used in financing activities was $260.2 million in 2003 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $709.3 million in 2002. During 2003, $217.2 million was used to repurchase our common stock. In addition, $100.0 million was used to fund the payment of senior guaranteed notes, which matured on July 15, 2003. These payments were offset by $57.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program. During 2002, proceeds of $938.5 million were received from the issuance of senior notes used to fund a portion of the Trigon acquisition. In addition, $30.9 million was received from the issuance of common stock due to the exercise of stock options and from our employee stock program. Offsetting these amounts was $256.2 million used to repurchase shares of common stock and $4.1 million used for costs related to the issuance of shares for the Trigon acquisition. Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001 During 2002, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $991.1 million, an increase of $336.5 million, or 51%, over 2001. The increase is a reflection of our improved net income. Favorable changes in our operating assets and liabilities complemented this increased net income to generate improved cash flow from operations. Net cash flow used in investing activities was $1,411.9 million in 2002, compared to $498.1 million in 2001, an increase of $913.8 million. The table below outlines where the changes between the two years occurred (in millions): Increase in purchases of subsidiaries, net of cash received $ (785.5 ) Decrease in proceeds from sales of subsidiaries (44.1 ) Increase in net purchases of investments (40.9 ) Increase in net purchases and proceeds from sale of property and equipment (43.3 ) Total increase in cash used in investing activities $ (913.8 ) The increase in subsidiary purchases resulted primarily from the Trigon acquisition in 2002, for which we paid $772.4 million in net cash. Cash acquired on Trigon’s balance sheet was $362.2 million, which partially offset $1,134.6 million used for the purchase price and transaction costs. The net decline in cash received from divestitures between the two years reflects proceeds from the sale of TRICARE in 2001, which did not occur in 2002. The purchase of investment securities increased as operating cash was moved into our investment 71 Table of Contents portfolio. The increased property and equipment purchases include $24.6 million of expenditures made by Trigon following the acquisition date, primarily on the construction of additional facilities. The remainder of the increased property purchases resulted from investments in computer technology and software. Net cash flow provided by financing activities was $709.3 million in 2002 compared to $46.6 million in 2001. On July 31, 2002, Anthem issued $950.0 million of long-term senior unsecured notes ($150.0 million of 4.875% notes due 2005, and $800.0 million of 6.800% notes due 2012). The net proceeds of $938.5 million from the note offering were used to pay a portion of the approximately $1,134.5 million of cash consideration and expenses associated with Anthem’s acquisition of Trigon. In addition, $30.9 million of proceeds resulted from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and through the employee stock purchase program. We used $256.2 million to repurchase our common stock during 2002. The $46.6 million of cash provided by financing activities during 2001 is related to the demutualization and initial public offering, after making payments to eligible statutory members. During our initial public offering, net proceeds of $2,110.2 million were received from issuance of common stock and Equity Security Units. These cash receipts were offset by payments of $2,063.6 million to eligible statutory members in the demutualization. Financial Condition We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments of $7.4 billion at December 31, 2003. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments increased by $736.7 million since December 31, 2002, primarily resulting from improved cash flows from operations partially offset by cash used for share repurchases and debt repayments. Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. During 2003, Anthem received $458.6 million of dividends from its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2003, Anthem held at the parent company approximately $666.4 million of our $7.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments, which are available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, share and debt repurchases and interest payments. Our consolidated debt-to-total-capital ratio (calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt plus shareholders’ equity) was 21.7% as of December 31, 2003 and 24.7% as of December 31, 2002. Our senior debt is rated “BBB+” by Standard & Poor’s, “A-” by Fitch, Inc., “Baa1” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “a-” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. A significant downgrade in our debt ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs. Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity We will have cash requirements of approximately $3.9 billion for the pending transaction with WellPoint, including both the cash portion of the purchase price and estimated transaction costs. During October 2003, we obtained a commitment for a bridge loan of up to $3.0 billion. Additionally, as of December 31, 2003, we have $666.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments and access to $1.0 billion of credit facilities, as discussed below. All indebtedness under the bridge loan must be repaid in full no later than March 31, 2005. At or near the expected closing of the WellPoint transaction in mid-2004, we plan to issue up to $2.0 billion of debt securities in a public offering to provide permanent financing. In addition, we expect to put in place an expanded $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, replacing our current $1.0 billion of credit facilities. Upon issuance of the $2.0 billion of debt securities and the increase of $1.5 billion in our revolving credit facilities, the $3.0 billion commitment for the bridge loan will be terminated. In addition, as part of the debt recapitalization associated with the WellPoint transaction, and using sources of liquidity described above, we may repurchase a portion of our surplus notes, subject to market conditions at that time. 72 Table of Contents Anthem maintains $1.0 billion of revolving lines of credit with its lender group. Under one facility, which expires November 5, 2006, Anthem may borrow up to $400.0 million. On July 1, 2003 a second facility was renewed which now expires June 29, 2004. Under this second facility, Anthem may borrow up to $600.0 million. Any amounts outstanding under this facility at June 29, 2004 (except amounts that bear interest rates determined by a competitive bidding process) convert to a one-year term loan at Anthem’s option. Anthem’s ability to borrow under these credit facilities is subject to compliance with certain covenants. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2003. There were no borrowings under these facilities for the year ended December 31, 2003. On January 27, 2003, the Board of Directors authorized management to establish a $1.0 billion commercial paper program. Proceeds from any issuance of commercial paper may be used for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of debt and common stock of Anthem. Commercial paper notes are short-term senior unsecured notes, with a maturity not to exceed 270 days from date of issuance. When issued, the notes bear interest at current market rates. There were no borrowings under this commercial paper program during the year ended December 31, 2003. On December 18, 2002, Anthem filed a shelf registration with the SEC to register any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings up to an aggregate amount of $1.0 billion. Specific information regarding terms of the offering and the securities being offered will be provided at the time of the offering. Proceeds from any offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt, capitalization of our subsidiaries or the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion. As of December 31, 2003, Anthem had $1.0 billion of the shelf registration capacity remaining. As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we are currently estimating approximately $400.0 million of dividends to be paid to Anthem during 2004. In 2003, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $500.0 million of stock under a program that will expire in February 2005. Under this program, repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. We purchased nearly 3.4 million shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2003, at a cost of $217.2 million. We currently have $282.8 million of authorization remaining under this program. Anthem Insurance repaid $100.0 million of senior guaranteed notes which matured on July 15, 2003. These notes were repaid from operating cash flows of Anthem Insurance. On November 15, 2004, the purchase contracts included within our Equity Security Units, or Units, will require each holder to purchase, for $50.00, a number of newly issued shares of our common stock equal to a settlement rate determined by the fair value of our common stock at that time. We will receive aggregate cash of $230.0 million upon exercise of the purchase contracts, based on the 4,600,000 Units outstanding at December 31, 2003. We will be required to issue between 5,244,000 and 6,394,000 shares of our common stock, depending on the average fair value of our common stock on each of the twenty consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day prior to November 15, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we funded $115.0 million to our cash balance pension plans. Our funding strategy, implemented during 2003, is to fund our pension plan on a quarterly basis, rather than making a single larger annual contribution. Future quarterly funding amounts may be adjusted based on changes in the market value of plan assets and changes to related assumptions. For the year ending December 31, 2004, the Company does not expect any required contributions under ERISA. The Company may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. 73 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commitments In connection with our pending transaction with WellPoint, WellPoint shareholders will receive consideration of twenty-three dollars and eighty cents in cash and one share of Anthem common stock for each WellPoint share outstanding. The total value of the transaction is estimated to be approximately $16.4 billion, based on the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on October 24, 2003. The transaction is expected to close by mid-2004, subject to, among other things, state regulatory and shareholder approval. Our other estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2003 are as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations and Commitments (In Millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Long term debt and capital leases $ 1,662.8 $ — $ 375.8 $ 1.6 $ 1,285.4 Operating leases 305.5 46.8 81.6 55.1 122.0 Venture capital commitments 23.9 — — 16.6 7.3 Purchase obligations 1 92.5 53.5 37.9 1.1 — Other long term liabilities reflected onour balance sheet 1,004.4 — 275.6 201.8 527.0 Total contractual obligations and commitments $ 3,089.1 $ 100.3 $ 770.9 $ 276.2 $ 1,941.7 1 Includes obligations related to IT service agreements and telecommunication contracts In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material non-cancelable commitments. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under Anthem’s credit agreements or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions. For additional information on our future debt maturities and lease commitments, see Notes 5 and 14, respectively, to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. Risk-Based Capital Our regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies largely based on the NAIC’s RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under this Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our risk-based capital as of December 31, 2003, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, was in excess of all mandatory RBC thresholds. In addition to exceeding the RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements of a licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. XI.

As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on Anthem’s financial positions as of December 31, 2003. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are preserving the asset base, maximizing investment income, and achieving an appropriate return commensurate with an acceptable level of risk. Investments Our investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk for equity holdings. The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit downgrade to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that downgrade. We manage this risk through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. Since we are advised of circumstances surrounding credit rating downgrades, we are able to promptly avoid or minimize exposure to losses by selling the subject security. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately A. Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities, due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio consists exclusively of U.S. dollar-denominated assets, invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds and mortgage-related securities, all of which represent an exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. We manage interest rate risk by 75 Table of Contents maintaining a duration commensurate with our insurance liabilities and shareholders’ equity. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value. Our investment policy prohibits use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio. Our portfolio includes corporate securities (approximately 46% of the total fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2003) which are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. This risk is managed through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately A. Our equity portfolio is comprised of index mutual funds that replicate the risk and performance of the S&P 500 and S&P 400 indices and is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systematic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in these index mutual funds, resulting in a diversified equity portfolio. All of our current investments are classified as available-for-sale. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 97% of these were fixed maturity securities. Market risk is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $276.0 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $249.9 million increase in fair value. As of December 31, 2003, no portion of our fixed maturity portfolio was invested in non-US dollar denominated investments. Our equity portfolio, as of December 31, 2003, was approximately 3% of our current investments. Equity investments consists of indexed mutual funds. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $19.4 million. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $19.4 million. No portion of our equity portfolio was invested in non-US dollar denominated investments as of December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, we held no derivative financial or commodity-based instruments. Long Term Debt Our senior unsecured notes are obligations of Anthem, Inc., or Anthem, and have fixed interest rates and the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. The senior unsecured notes consist of two issues, $800.0 million of 6.80% notes due 2012 and $150.0 million of 4.875% notes due 2005. These notes had a combined carrying value of $940.1 million and $939.9 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The estimated fair value of these instruments exceeded the carrying amount by $127.6 million and $80.3 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of these notes would decrease or increase accordingly. Our debentures included in our Equity Security Units, or debentures, are obligations of Anthem and are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to all of Anthem’s existing and future senior indebtedness. At December 31, 2003 there were 4,600,000 Equity Security Units outstanding. Each Equity Security Unit contains a purchase contract under which the holder agrees to purchase, for fifty dollars, shares of Anthem common stock on November 15, 2004, and a 5.95% subordinated debenture. The number of shares to be issued under the purchase contract will be determined based on the average fair value of our common stock on each of the twenty consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day preceding November 15, 2004. If the applicable fair 76 Table of Contents value of our stock is greater or equal to $43.92, the settlement rate will be 1.14 shares of our common stock per purchase contract. If the applicable fair value of our common stock is less than $43.92 but greater than $36.00, the settlement rate will be equal to $50.00 divided by the applicable market value of our common stock per purchase contract. If the applicable fair value of our common stock is less than or equal to $36.00, the settlement rate will be 1.39 shares of our common stock per purchase contract. Our common stock closing price as of December 31, 2003 was $75.00. The interest rate on the debentures is fixed at 5.95% until November 15, 2004, at which point it will be reset to 100.5% of a value determined by re-marketing of the Units. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, the carrying value of the debentures were $224.3 million and $222.2 million. The debentures estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by $181.6 million and $135.1 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Any increase or decrease in market interest rates in the future will accordingly decrease or increase the estimated fair value of the debentures. Our subordinated debt consists of two issues of surplus notes ($300.0 million of 9.125% notes due 2010 and $200.0 million of 9.000% notes due 2027) with fixed interest rates. Surplus notes are unsecured obligations of Anthem Insurance Companies, Inc., or Anthem Insurance, and are subordinate in right of payment to all of Anthem Insurance’s existing and future indebtedness. Any payment of interest or principal on the surplus notes may be made only with the prior approval of the Indiana Department of Insurance. The combined carrying value of the surplus notes was $494.1 million and $493.6 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The estimated fair value of the surplus notes exceeded the carrying value by $157.9 million and $107.0 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our surplus notes would decrease or increase accordingly. Cash Flow Hedges On February 6, 2004, we entered into forward starting pay fixed hedging transactions with a notional amount of $500.0 million. These hedges are being used to eliminate uncertainty related to future interest payments on the expected issuance of debt securities to partially fund the cash portion of the WellPoint transaction, which is expected to close in mid-2004. The hedge transactions had no impact on our financial position or results of operations at inception. However, in future reporting periods, these hedges will be affected by changes in market interest rates. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of the hedges would increase or decrease accordingly. 77 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:53:21.257764

BUSINESS. General We are the largest publicly traded commercial health benefits company in terms of membership in the United States, serving more than 27 million medical members as of December 31, 2004. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health benefit plans, and serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or BCBS, licensee for twelve other states: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. We also serve customers throughout various parts of the United States as HealthLink and UniCare. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states and Puerto Rico through our subsidiaries. On November 30, 2004, Anthem, Inc. (“Anthem”) and WellPoint Health Networks Inc. (“WHN”) completed their merger. WHN merged with and into Anthem Holding Corp., a direct and wholly-owned subsidiary of Anthem, with Anthem Holding Corp. as the surviving entity in the merger. In connection with the merger, Anthem amended its articles of incorporation to change its name to WellPoint, Inc. (“WellPoint”). We offer a broad spectrum of network-based managed care plans to the large and small employer, individual, Medicaid and senior markets. Our managed care plans include preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, point-of-service plans, or POS plans, traditional indemnity plans and other hybrid plans, including consumer directed, hospital only and limited benefit products. In addition, we provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers, including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management and other administrative services. We also provide an array of specialty and other products and services including pharmacy benefit management, group life and disability insurance, dental, vision, behavioral health benefits, workers compensation and long-term care insurance. For our insured products, we charge a premium and assume all or a majority of the health care risk. Under self-funded and partially insured products, we charge a fee for services, and the employer or plan sponsor reimburses us for all or a majority of the health care costs. Approximately 92% of our 2004 operating revenue was derived from premium income, while approximately 8% was derived from administrative services and other revenues. Our customer base primarily includes large groups with 51 or more employees (47.1% of our medical members at December 31, 2004), and individuals under age 65 and small groups of one to 50 employees (18.8% of our medical members as of December 31, 2004). Other major customer categories include National Accounts, BlueCard Host, Senior (over age 65 individuals and Medicare Supplement or Medicare Advantage policies) and State Sponsored Programs (primarily Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Plans). We market our products through an extensive network of independent agents and brokers (primarily for Individual, Small Group and Senior customers) and through our in-house sales force that are compensated on a commission basis for new sales and retention of existing business (primarily for Large Group customers). The aging of the population and other demographic characteristics and advances in medical technology continue to contribute to rising health care costs. Our managed care plans and products are designed to encourage providers and members to participate in quality, cost-effective health benefit plans by using the full range of our innovative medical management services, quality initiatives and financial incentives. Our leading market shares enable us to realize the long-term benefits of investing in preventive and early detection programs. Our ability to provide cost-effective health benefits products and services is enhanced through a disciplined approach to internal cost containment, prudent management of our risk exposure and successful integration of acquired businesses. 3 Our results of operations depend in large part on accurately predicting health care costs and on our ability to manage future health care costs through underwriting criteria, medical management, product design and negotiation of favorable provider contracts. We believe health care is local, and feel that we have the strong local presence required to understand and meet local customer needs. We believe we are well-positioned to deliver what customers want: innovative, choice-based products; distinctive service; simplified administrative transactions; and better access to information for quality care and decision-making. We believe our local presence and national expertise create opportunities for collaborative programs that reward physicians and hospitals for clinical quality and excellence. We feel that our commitment to health improvement and care management provides added value to customers and health care professionals. Like many of our competitors, our vision for the future includes becoming a premier e-business organization by automating interactions with customers, brokers, agents, employees and other stakeholders through web-enabling technology and redesigning internal operations. We are developing our e-business strategy with the goal of becoming widely regarded as an e-business leader in the health benefits industry. The strategy includes not only sales and distribution of health benefits products on the Internet, but also implementation of advanced self-service capabilities benefiting customers, agents, brokers, partners and our associates. We intend to continue to expand through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of the additional economies of scale provided by increased overall membership. In addition, we believe geographic diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for expansion. While the majority of our growth has been the result of strategic mergers and acquisitions, we have also achieved organic growth in our existing markets by providing excellent service, offering competitively priced products and effectively capturing the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks. WellPoint is an accelerated filer (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and is required, pursuant to Item 101 of Regulation S-K, to provide certain information regarding its website and the availability of certain documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Our website is www.wellpoint.com. We make available free of charge on or through our Internet website our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the SEC. Recent Transactions As discussed above, Anthem and WHN completed their merger on November 30, 2004. Prior to the merger, both Anthem and WHN had individually expanded through organic growth and acquisitions. Listed below are the most recent major transactions that were completed by the pre-merger companies. • On September 24, 2003, WHN completed its acquisition of Cobalt Corporation, the parent company of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wisconsin. • On July 31, 2002, Anthem completed its purchase of Trigon Healthcare, Inc (“Trigon”). Trigon was the Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensee in Virginia, excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. • On January 31, 2002, WHN completed its acquisition of RightCHOICE Managed Care, Inc., the parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area). 4 Industry Overview The health benefits industry has experienced significant change in the last decade. The increasing focus on health care costs by employers, the government and consumers has led to the growth of alternatives to traditional indemnity health insurance. HMO, PPO and hybrid plans, such as POS plans, incorporating features of each, are among the various forms of managed care products that have developed over a number of years. Through these types of products, we attempt to contain the cost of health care by negotiating contracts with hospitals, physicians and other providers to deliver health care at favorable rates. These products usually feature medical management and other quality and cost optimization measures such as pre-admission review and approval for non-emergency hospital services, pre-authorization of outpatient surgical procedures, and network credentialing to determine that network doctors and hospitals have the required certifications and expertise. In addition, providers may share medical cost risk or have other incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost-effective manner. HMO, PPO and POS members generally are charged periodic, pre-paid premiums, and pay co-payments or deductibles when they receive services. PPO and POS plans provide benefits for out-of-network usage, typically at higher out-of-pocket costs to members. HMO members generally select one of the network’s primary care physicians, who then assume responsibility for coordinating their health care services. Typically, there is no out-of-network benefit for HMO members except in emergencies. PPOs and other open access plans generally provide coverage when members select non-network providers without coordination through a primary care physician, but at a higher out-of-pocket cost. Hybrid plans, such as POS plans, typically involve the selection of primary care physicians similar to HMOs, but allow members to self refer or to choose non-network providers at higher out-of-pocket costs similar to those of PPOs. Recently, economic factors and greater consumer awareness have resulted in the increasing popularity of products that offer larger, more extensive networks, more member choice related to coverage and the ability to self refer within those networks. There is also a growing preference for greater flexibility for customers to assume larger deductibles and co-payments in exchange for lower premiums. We believe we are well positioned in each of our regions to respond to these market preferences. Our PPO products, which contain most or all of the features noted above, have experienced significant growth over the past few years. The BCBSA has also undergone significant change in recent years. Historically, most states had at least one Blue Cross (hospital coverage) and a separate Blue Shield (physician coverage) company. Prior to the mid 1980s there were more than 125 separate Blue Cross or Blue Shield companies. Many of these organizations have merged, reducing the number of independent licensees to 40 as of December 31, 2004. Each of the BCBS companies works cooperatively in a number of ways that create significant market advantages, especially when competing for very large multi-state employer groups. As a result of this cooperation, each BCBS company is able to take advantage of other BCBS licensees’ substantial provider networks and discounts when any member from one state works or travels outside of the state in which the policy is written. This program is referred to as BlueCard®, and is a source of revenue for providing member services in our states for individuals who are customers of other BCBS plans. Competition The managed care industry is highly competitive, both nationally and in our regional markets. Competition continues to be intense due to more aggressive marketing, a proliferation of new products and increased quality awareness and price sensitivity among customers. Significant consolidation within the industry has also added to competition. In addition, with the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, banks and other financial institutions have the ability to affiliate with insurance companies, which may lead to new competitors in the insurance and health benefits fields. 5 Industry participants compete for customers mainly on the following factors: • price; • quality of service; • access to provider networks; • flexibility of benefit designs; • reputation (including NCQA accreditation status); • brand recognition; and • financial stability. Over the last few years, a health plan’s ability to interact with employers, members and other third parties (including health care professionals) via the Internet has become a more important competitive factor. During the last several years, we have made significant technology investments to enhance our electronic interaction with third parties. We believe our exclusive right to market products under the BCBS brand in many of our markets provides us with an advantage over our competition. In addition, our provider networks in our regions enable us to achieve cost-efficiencies and service levels that allow us to offer a broad range of health benefits to our customers on a more cost-effective basis than many of our competitors. We strive to distinguish our products through provider access, excellent service, product value and brand recognition. To build our provider networks, we also compete with other health benefits plans for contracts with hospitals, physicians and other providers. We believe that physicians and other providers primarily consider member volume, reimbursement rates, timeliness of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities along with the reduction of non-value added administrative tasks when deciding whether to contract with a health benefits plan. At the sales and distribution level, we compete for qualified agents and brokers to distribute our products. Strong competition exists among insurance companies and health benefits plans for agents and brokers with demonstrated ability to secure new business and maintain existing accounts. The basis of competition for the services of such agents and brokers are: • commission structure; • support services; • reputation and prior relationships; and • quality of the products. We believe that we have good relationships with our agents and brokers, and that our products, support services and commission structure compare favorably to our competitors in all of our regions. Operating Segments Following the merger with WHN on November 30, 2004, our organizational structure changed. As a result of this change, we established three reportable segments: Health Care, Specialty and Other. Health Care Our Health Care segment is an aggregation of various operating segments, principally differentiated by geographic areas within which we offer similar health benefit products and services. These geographic areas include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. In addition, UniCare and HealthLink provide services in various other areas of the United States. 6 Specialty Our Specialty segment is comprised of businesses providing pharmacy benefit management, group life and disability insurance benefits, dental, workers’ compensation and long-term care insurance. We also provide benefits for vision and behavioral health services. Other Our Other segment is comprised of our Medicare processing business, including AdminaStar Federal and United Government Services; Arcus Enterprises; intersegment revenue and expense eliminations; and corporate expenses not allocated to our Health Care or Specialty segments. For additional information regarding the operating results of our segments, see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 included in this Form 10-K. Products and Services Health Care A general description of our health benefit products and services is provided below: Preferred Provider Organization. PPO products offer the member an option to select any health care provider, with benefits reimbursed by us at a higher level when care is received from a participating network provider. Coverage is subject to co-payments or deductibles and coinsurance, with member cost sharing usually limited by out-of-pocket maximums. Traditional Indemnity. Indemnity products offer the member an option to select any health care provider for covered services. Coverage is subject to deductibles and coinsurance, with member cost sharing usually limited by out-of-pocket maximums. Health Maintenance Organization. HMO products include comprehensive managed care benefits, generally through a participating network of physicians, hospitals and other providers. A member in one of our HMOs must typically select a primary care physician, or PCP, from our network. PCPs generally are family practitioners, internists or pediatricians who provide necessary preventive and primary medical care, and are generally responsible for coordinating other necessary health care services. Preventive care services are emphasized in these plans. We offer HMO plans with varying levels of co-payments, which result in different levels of premium rates. Point-of-Service. POS products blend the characteristics of HMO and indemnity plans. Members can have comprehensive HMO-style benefits through participating network providers with minimum out-of-pocket expense (co-payments) and also can go directly, without a referral, to any provider they choose, subject to, among other things, certain deductibles and coinsurance. Member cost sharing is limited by out-of-pocket maximums. Management Services. In addition to fully insured products, we provide administrative services to large group employers that maintain self-funded health plans. These administrative services include underwriting, actuarial services, medical management, claims processing and administrative services for self-funded employers. Self-funded health plans are also able to use our provider networks and to realize savings through our negotiated provider arrangements, while allowing employers the ability to design certain health benefit plans in accordance with their own requirements and objectives. We also write stop loss insurance for self-funded plans. 7 Senior Plans. We offer numerous Medicare supplemental plans, which typically pay the difference between health care costs incurred by a beneficiary and amounts paid by Medicare. We also offer a managed care alternative to the Medicare program in certain geographic areas. We also offer Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare approved drug discount cards in certain geographic regions. Our Medicare Advantage plans provide Medicare beneficiaries with a managed care alternative to traditional Medicare. Our Medicare approved drug discount cards affords Medicare beneficiaries, without prescription drug coverage, access to our drug discounts. BlueCard Plan. BlueCard host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer sponsored health plan serviced by a non-WellPoint controlled BCBS licensee, who is the “home” plan. We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard host members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Medicaid Plans and Other State-Sponsored Programs. In California, a subsidiary holds contracts with the state to provide managed care programs to MediCal, California’s Medicaid program in a large part of the state. We have also obtained Medicaid contracts to serve members in several other states (and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) in which we conduct business. Specialty Pharmacy Products. We offer pharmacy services and pharmacy benefit management services to our members. Our pharmacy services incorporate features such as drug formularies (where we develop lists of preferred, cost effective drugs), a pharmacy network and maintenance of a prescription drug database and mail order capabilities. Pharmacy benefit management services provided by us include management of drug utilization through outpatient prescription drug formularies, retrospective review and drug education for physicians, pharmacists and members. Two of our subsidiaries are also licensed pharmacies and make prescription dispensing services available through mail order for pharmacy benefit management clients. Life Insurance. We offer an array of competitive group life insurance benefit products to both large and small group customers in conjunction with our health plans. The life products include term life, accidental death and dismemberment. Disability. We offer short-term and long-term disability programs, usually in conjunction with our health plans. Behavioral Health. We offer specialized behavioral health plans and benefit management. These plans cover mental health and substance abuse treatment services on both an inpatient and an outpatient basis. We have implemented employee assistance and behavioral managed care programs for a wide variety of businesses throughout the United States. These programs are offered through our subsidiaries and through third party behavioral health networks. Dental. Our dental plans include networks in certain states in which we operate. Many of the dental benefits are provided to customers enrolled in our health plans and are offered on both an insured and self-funded basis. Vision Services. These services are primarily for our customers enrolled in our health plans. Long-Term Care Insurance. We offer long-term care insurance products to our California members through a subsidiary. The long-term care products include tax-qualified and non-tax qualified versions of a skilled nursing home care plan and comprehensive policies covering skilled, intermediate and custodial long-term care and home health services. Workers Compensation Plan. We offer workers compensation products to employees principally in the states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Iowa. 8 Other Medicare Fiscal Intermediary Operations. Through our AdminaStar Federal and United Government Services subsidiaries, we serve as fiscal intermediaries for the Medicare program, which generally provides coverage for persons who are 65 or older and for persons who are disabled or with end-stage renal disease. Part A of the Medicare program provides coverage for services provided by hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and other health care facilities. Part B of the Medicare program provides coverage for services provided by physicians, physical and occupational therapists and other professional providers. United Government Services serves as the largest Part A fiscal intermediary in the United States. As a fiscal intermediary, we receive reimbursement for certain costs and expenditures. Customer Segmentation Our products are generally developed and marketed with an emphasis on the differing needs of various customer groups. In particular, our product development and marketing efforts take into account the differing characteristics between the various customer groups served by us, including individuals and small employers, large employers, seniors and Medicaid recipients, as well as the unique needs of educational and public entities, federal employee health and benefit programs, national employers and state-run programs servicing low-income, high-risk and under-served markets. Individual business units are responsible for product design, pricing, enrolling, underwriting and servicing customers in specific customer groups. We believe that one of the keys to our success has been the focus on distinct customer groups defined generally by employer size and geographic region, which better enables us to develop benefit plans and services that meet the unique needs of the distinct markets. In each geographic region, we balance the need to customize products with the efficiencies of product standardization. Overall, we seek to establish pricing and product designs to achieve an appropriate level of profitability for each of our customer categories. As of December 31, 2004, our customer types include the following categories: • Large groups include employers with 51 to 4,999 employees eligible to participate as a member in one of our health plans as well as public entities that serve educational and public sector clients. These groups are generally sold through brokers or consultants working with industry specialists from our in-house sales force. Large group cases may be experience rated or sold on a self-insured basis. The customer’s buying decision is typically based upon the size and breadth of our networks, customer service, the quality of our medical management services, the administrative cost included in our quoted price, our financial stability, and our ability to effectively service large complex accounts. Large group also includes members in the Federal Employee Program. As a BCBSA licensee, we participate in a nationwide contract with the Federal government whereby we cover Federal employees and their dependents in our multi-state service area. Under a complex formula, we are reimbursed for our costs plus a fee. We also participate in the overall financial risk for medical claims on a pooled basis with the other participating BCBS companies. Large groups accounted for 47.1% of our members at December 31, 2004. • Individual (under 65) and small groups are defined as members who purchase health insurance services as individuals or through employers with one to 50 eligible employees. While individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers or our in-house sales force, small groups are sold almost exclusively through independent agents and brokers. Small group cases are sold on a fully-insured basis. Underwriting and pricing is typically done on a community rated basis. (See “Regulation—Small Group Reform” below.) Conversely, individual business is usually medically underwritten at the point of initial issuance. Individual and small group customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network, and the efficiency of administration. Account turnover is generally higher with individual and small groups as compared to large groups. In several of our markets, there is much less competition for individual business than group contracts. Individuals and small groups accounted for 18.8% of our members at December 31, 2004. 9 • National Accounts are defined as multi-state employer groups headquartered in a WellPoint service area with 5,000 or more eligible employees, including 5% or more located in a service area outside of the headquarters state. National Accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. We have a significant advantage when competing for very large National Accounts due to our ability to access the national provider networks of BCBS companies and take advantage of their provider discounts in their local markets. National Accounts represented 11.6% of our members at December 31, 2004. • BlueCard host customers are defined as enrollees of other BCBS plans, or the “home” plans, who receive health care services in our BCBS licensed markets. BlueCard host membership accounted for 12.5% of our members at December 31, 2004. • Senior customers are defined as members age 65 and over with Medicare Supplement or Medicare Advantage policies. Medicare Supplement policies are sold to Medicare recipients as supplements to the benefits they receive from the Medicare program. Rates are filed with and in some cases approved by state insurance departments. The Medicare Advantage program is the managed care alternative to the federally funded Medicare program. Most of the premium is paid directly by the Federal government on behalf of the participant who may also be charged a small premium. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner. Senior business accounted for 3.8% of our members at December 31, 2004. • State sponsored program membership are defined as eligible members with state sponsored managed care alternatives for the Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance programs that we manage. In 2000, WHN entered into a joint venture with Medical Card Systems, Inc., a Puerto Rico-based group health and life insurer, to pursue contracts under the Health Reform Program in Puerto Rico. As of December 31, 2004, the company’s 50% share of this joint venture served approximately 252,000 members. Total state sponsored program business accounted for 6.2% of our members at December 31, 2004. In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two principal funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain some or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some employers choose to purchase stop-loss coverage to limit their retained risk. These employers are reported with our self-funded business. 10 The following tables set forth our health benefits membership by customer type and funding arrangement, both on a reported basis and a comparable basis assuming the merger of Anthem and WHN had occurred as of December 31, 2003: Reported Basis December 31 2004 2003 (In Thousands) Customer Type Large Group 13,073 4,708 Individual and Small Group (ISG) 5,199 1,954 National Accounts 3,212 1,640 BlueCard 3,463 2,816 Total National 6,675 4,456 Senior 1,059 599 State Sponsored 1,722 210 Total 27,728 11,927 Funding Arrangement Self-funded 13,039 6,412 Fully-insured 14,689 5,515 Total 27,728 11,927 Comparable Basis 1 December 31 2004 2003 (In Thousands) Customer Type Large Group 13,073 12,740 Individual and Small Group (ISG) 5,199 4,867 National Accounts 3,212 2,668 BlueCard 3,463 2,931 Total National 6,675 5,599 Senior 1,059 1,063 State Sponsored 1,722 1,781 Total 27,728 26,050 Funding Arrangement Self-funded 13,039 11,750 Fully-insured 14,689 14,300 Total 27,728 26,050 1 Comparable basis was calculated by adding historical statistics for the former WHN to historical statistics for the former Anthem and adjusting the combined totals to assure a consistent approach for calculating membership and to eliminate overlapping BlueCard host membership. For additional information regarding the change in membership between years, see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Form 10-K. 11 Networks and Provider Relations Our relationships with physicians, hospitals and professionals that provide health care services to our members are guided by regional and national standards for network development, reimbursement and contract methodologies. It is generally our philosophy not to delegate full financial responsibility to our physician providers in the form of capitation-based reimbursement. In certain markets we believe capitation can be a useful method to lower costs and reduce underwriting risk and we have some capitation contracts. We attempt to provide market-based hospital reimbursement along industry standards. We also seek to ensure physicians in our network are paid in a timely manner at appropriate rates. We use multi-year contracting strategies, including case or fixed rates, to limit our exposure to medical cost inflation and increase cost predictability. In all regions, we seek to maintain broad provider networks to ensure member choice while implementing programs designed to improve the quality of care received by our members. Depending on the consolidation and integration of physician groups and hospitals, reimbursement strategies vary across markets. Fee for service is our predominant reimbursement methodology for physicians. We generally use a resource-based relative value system (“RBRVS”) fee schedule to determine fee for service reimbursement. However, we also use proprietary fee schedules in certain markets. The RBRVS structure was developed and is maintained by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, and is used by the Medicare program and other major payers. The RBRVS and proprietary systems are independent of submitted fees and therefore is not as vulnerable to inflation. In addition, we are implementing physician incentive contracting which recognizes clinical quality and performance as a basis for reimbursement. Like our physician contracts, our hospital contracts provide for a variety of reimbursement arrangements depending on the network. Our hospital contracts recognize unique hospital attributes (e.g., academic medical centers or community hospitals) and the volume of care performed for our members. Many hospitals are reimbursed on a fixed amount per day for covered services (per diem) or a case rate basis similar to Medicare (Diagnosis Related Groups). Other hospitals are reimbursed on a discount from approved charge basis for covered services. Hospital outpatient services are reimbursed based on fixed case rates, fee schedules or percent of charges. To improve predictability of expected cost, we frequently use a multi-year contracting approach which provides stability in our competitive position versus other health benefit plans in the market, and have been transitioning to case rate payment methodologies. Many of our renewing hospital contracts have reimbursement linked to improved clinical performance, patient safety and medical error reduction. Medical Management Programs Our medical management programs include a broad array of activities that facilitate improvements in the quality of care provided to our members and promote cost effective medical care. These medical management activities and programs are administered and directed by physicians and trained nurses employed by us. One of the goals of our medical management strategies is to assure that the care delivered to our members is supported by appropriate medical and scientific evidence. Precertification. A traditional medical management program involves assessment of the appropriateness of certain hospitalizations and other medical services. For example, precertification is used to determine whether a set of hospital and medical services is being appropriately applied to the member’s clinical condition, in accordance with criteria for medical necessity as that term is defined in the member’s benefits contract. Concurrent review. Another traditional medical management strategy we use is concurrent review, which is based on nationally recognized criteria developed for the industry. With concurrent review, the requirements and intensity of services during a patient’s hospital stay are reviewed, often by an onsite skilled nurse 12 professional in collaboration with the hospital’s medical and nursing staff, in order to coordinate care and determine the most effective transition of care from the hospital setting. Disease management. We are using more sophisticated care models built around disease management and advanced care management. These programs focus on those members who have chronic and/or complex illness and require the greatest amount of medical services. We provide important information to our physician providers and members to help them optimally manage the care of their specific conditions. For example, certain therapies and interventions for patients with diabetes help prevent some of the serious, long-term medical consequences of diabetes and reduce the risks of kidney, eye and heart disease. Our information systems can provide feedback to our physicians to enable them to improve the quality of care. For other prevalent medical conditions such as heart disease and asthma, our ability to correlate pharmacy data and medical management data allows us to provide important information to our members, physicians and other providers which enables them to more effectively manage these conditions. Advanced care management. A significant amount of health care expenditures are for services consumed by a small percent of our members who suffer from complex or chronic illnesses. We have developed a series of programs aimed at helping our network physicians better manage and improve the health of these members. Often, these programs provide benefits for home care services and other support to reduce the need for repeated, expensive hospitalizations. Formulary management. We have developed formularies, which are selections of drugs based on clinical quality and effectiveness. A pharmacy and therapeutics committee uses scientific and clinical evidence to assure that our members have access to the appropriate therapies. Medical policy. A medical policy group comprised of physician leaders from all of our geographic regions, working in close cooperation with academic medical centers, practicing community physicians, and medical specialty organizations such as the American College of Radiology and national organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and the American Cancer Society determines our national policy for the application of new technologies. Quality programs. We are actively engaged with our hospital networks to enable them to improve medical and surgical care and achieve better outcomes for our members. We endorse, encourage and incent hospitals to support national initiatives to improve clinical care, patient outcomes and reduce medication errors and hospital infections. We have been recognized as a national leader in developing hospital quality programs. External review procedures. In light of public concerns about health plans denying coverage of medical services, we work with outside experts through a process of external review to provide our members scientifically and clinically, evidenced-based medical care. When we receive member concerns, we have formal appeals procedures that ultimately allow coverage disputes related to medical necessity decisions under the benefits contract to be settled by independent expert physicians. Service management. In HMO and POS networks, primary care physicians serve as the overall coordinators of members’ health care needs by providing an array of preventive health services and overseeing referrals to specialists for appropriate medical care. In PPO networks, patients have access to network physicians without a primary care physician serving as the coordinator of care. Health Care Quality Initiatives Increasingly, the health care industry is able to define quality health care based on preventive health measurements, outcomes of care and optimal care management for chronic disease. A key to our success has been our ability to work with our network physicians and hospitals to improve the quality and outcomes of the health care services provided to our members. Our ability to promote quality medical care has been recognized by the National Committee on Quality Assurance, or NCQA, the largest and most respected national accreditation program for managed care health plans. 13 A range of quality health care measures, including the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set, or HEDIS, has been incorporated into the oversight certification by NCQA. HEDIS measures range from preventive services, such as screening mammography and pediatric immunization, to elements of care, including decreasing the complications of diabetes and improving treatment for patients with heart disease. For the HMO and POS plans, NCQA’s highest accreditation is granted only to those plans that demonstrate levels of service and clinical quality that meet or exceed NCQA’s rigorous requirements for consumer protection and quality improvement. Plans earning this accreditation level must also achieve HEDIS results that are in the highest range of national or regional performance. For the PPO plans, NCQA’s highest accreditation is granted to those plans that have excellent programs for quality improvement and consumer protection and that meet or exceed NCQA’s standards. In addition, we have initiated a broad array of quality programs, including those built around smoking cessation and transplant management, and increasingly effective hospital and physician quality initiatives centered on women’s health care, diabetes and patient safety. Pricing and Underwriting of Our Products We price our products based on our assessment of underwriting risk, administrative expenses and competitive factors. We continually review our product designs, underwriting and pricing guidelines on a national and regional basis so that our products remain competitive and consistent with our marketing strategies and profitability goals. We have focused our efforts to maintain consistent, competitive and strict underwriting standards. Our individual and group underwriting targets have been based on our proprietary accumulated actuarial data. Subject to applicable legal constraints, we have traditionally employed case specific underwriting procedures for small group products and traditional group underwriting procedures with respect to large group products. Also, we employ credit underwriting procedures with respect to our self-funded products. In most circumstances, our pricing and underwriting decisions follow a prospective rating process. A fixed premium rate is determined at the beginning of the policy period. Unanticipated increases in medical costs may not be able to be recovered in that current policy year. However, prior experience, in the aggregate, is considered in determining premium rates for future periods. For larger groups (over 300 persons) with PPO, POS or traditional benefit designs, we may employ retrospective rating reviews. In retrospective rating, a premium rate is determined at the beginning of the policy period. Once the policy period has ended, the actual experience is reviewed. If the experience is positive (i.e., actual claim costs and other expenses are less than those expected), then a refund may be credited to the policy. If the experience is negative, then the resulting deficit may either be recovered through contractual provisions or the deficit may be considered in setting future premium levels for the group. We have contracts with CMS to provide HMO Medicare Advantage coverage to Medicare beneficiaries who choose health care coverage through one of our HMO programs in certain geographic regions. Under these annual contracts, CMS pays us a set rate based on membership that is adjusted for demographic factors. These rates are subject to annual unilateral revision by CMS. In addition to premiums received from CMS, most of the Medicare products offered by us require a supplemental premium to be paid by the member. See “Regulation—Small Group Reform” below for a discussion of certain regulatory restrictions on our underwriting and pricing. Investments At December 31, 2004, we held investment securities with an estimated fair value of $13.6 billion. Our investment portfolio is subject to credit risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk. We manage these risks by establishing credit quality limitations as well as dollar limits of individual issuers. Approximately 91% of our 14 current investments were debt securities, of which approximately 44% included corporate securities. The average credit rating of our corporate fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2004 was approximately AA. We evaluate our investment securities on a continuous basis, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We believe we have adequately reviewed our investments for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. For additional information, see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Section of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Investments, and Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 included in this Form 10-K. Liability for Medical Claims Payable We establish and report liabilities or reserves on our balance sheet for medical claims payable by estimating the ultimate cost of incurred claims that have not yet been reported to us by members or providers and reported claims that have not yet been paid. The amounts recorded represent our estimates and the process requires a high degree of judgment. Reserves are established according to Actuarial Standards of Practice and generally accepted actuarial principles and are based on a number of factors. Due to the variability inherent in these assumptions, reserve estimates are sensitive to changes in medical claims payment patterns and changes in medical cost trends. Adjustments to claims liabilities occur each quarter and are sometimes significant as compared to net income recorded in that quarter. As of December 31, 2004, the amount in these liability accounts was $4.2 billion. For additional information, see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 10 to our consolidated audited financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Debt We had approximately $4.3 billion of long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately $2.6 billion from year end 2003, primarily a result of funding the WHN merger. Our debt-to-total capital ratio was 18.5% at December 31, 2004, as compared to 21.7% as of December 31, 2003. Our senior debt is rated “BBB+” by Standard & Poor’s, “A-” by Fitch, Inc., “Baa1” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “a-” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. BCBSA License We have filed for registration of and maintain several service marks, trademarks and trade names at the federal level and in various states in which we operate. We have the exclusive right the use the BCBS names and marks for our health benefits products in California (Blue Cross only), Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. Each license requires an annual fee to be paid to the BCBSA. The fee is based upon enrollment and premium. BCBSA is a national trade association of Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees, the primary function of which is to promote and preserve the integrity of the BCBS names and marks, as well as provide certain coordination among the member companies. Each BCBSA licensee is an independent legal organization and is not responsible for obligations of other BCBSA member organizations. We have no right to market products and services using the BCBS names and marks outside of our core states. We believe that the BCBS names and marks are valuable identifiers of our products and services in the marketplace. The license agreements, which have a perpetual term, contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the BCBS names and marks. Upon termination of the license agreements, we would cease to have the right to use the BCBS names and marks in one or more of the states that we are authorized to use the marks and the BCBSA could thereafter issue a license to use the BCBS names and marks in 15 these states to another entity. Events that could cause the termination of a license agreement with the BCBSA include failure to comply with minimum capital requirements, a change of control or violation of the BCBSA ownership limits on our capital stock, impending financial insolvency, the appointment of a trustee or receiver or the commencement of any action against a licensee seeking its dissolution. The license agreements with the BCBSA contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the BCBS names and marks, including: • minimum capital and liquidity requirements; • enrollment and customer service performance requirements; • participation in programs that provide portability of membership between plans; • disclosure to the BCBSA relating to enrollment and financial conditions; • disclosures as to the structure of the BCBS system in contracts with third parties and in public statements; • plan governance requirements; • a requirement that at least 80% (or, in the case of Blue Cross of California, substantially all) of a licensee’s annual combined net revenue attributable to health benefit plans within its service area must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the BCBS names and marks; • a requirement that neither a plan nor any of its licensed affiliates may permit an entity other than a plan or a licensed affiliate to obtain control of the plan or the licensed affiliate or to acquire a substantial portion of its assets related to licensable services; • a requirement that we guarantee the contractual and financial obligations of our licensed affiliates; and • a requirement that we indemnify the BCBSA against any claims asserted against us resulting from the contractual and financial obligations of any subsidiary that serves as a fiscal intermediary providing administrative services for Medicare Parts A and B. We believe that we and our licensed affiliates are currently in compliance with these standards. The standards under the license agreements may be modified in certain instances by the BCBSA. Regulation General Our operations are subject to comprehensive and detailed state and federal regulation throughout the United States in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Supervisory agencies, including state health, insurance and corporation departments, have broad authority to: • grant, suspend and revoke licenses to transact business; • regulate many aspects of our products and services; • monitor our solvency and reserve adequacy; and • scrutinize our investment activities on the basis of quality, diversification and other quantitative criteria. To carry out these tasks, these regulators periodically examine our operations and accounts. 16 Regulation of Insurance Company and HMO Business Activity The federal government, as well as the governments of the states in which we conduct our operations, have adopted laws and regulations that govern our business activities in various ways. These laws and regulations, which vary significantly by state, may restrict how we conduct our businesses and may result in additional burdens and costs to us. Areas of governmental regulation include but are not limited to: • licensure; • premium rates; • benefits; • service areas; • market conduct; • utilization review activities; • prompt payment of claims; • universal health care regulation based on the availability to individuals and small groups of a government sponsored health plan administered by a private contractor and funded by increased premium taxes; • assessments for state run immunization programs; • requirements that pharmacy benefit managers pass manufacturers’ rebates to customers; • member rights and responsibilities; • sales and marketing activities; • quality assurance procedures; • plan design and disclosures; • collection, access or use of protected health information; • eligibility requirements; • provider rates of payment; • surcharges on provider payments; • provider contract forms; • provider access standards; • premium taxes and assessments for the uninsured and / or underinsured; • underwriting, marketing and rating restrictions for small group products; • member and provider complaints and appeals; • underwriting and pricing; • financial arrangements; • financial condition (including reserves); and • corporate governance. These laws and regulations are subject to amendments and changing interpretations in each jurisdiction. States generally require health insurers and HMOs to obtain a certificate of authority prior to commencing operations. If we were to establish a health insurance company or an HMO in any state where we do not 17 presently operate, we generally would have to obtain such a certificate. The time necessary to obtain such a certificate varies from state to state. Each health insurer and HMO must file periodic financial and operating reports with the states in which it does business. In addition, health insurers and HMOs are subject to state examination and periodic license renewal. There has been a recent trend of increased health care regulation at the federal and state levels. Proposed actions and legislation, regulation and initiatives relating to this trend include, among other things, the following: • eliminating or reducing the scope of ERISA pre-emption of state medical and bad faith claims under state law, thereby exposing health benefits companies to expanded liability for punitive and other extra-contractual damages; • requiring an insurer to pay claims during grace periods irrespective of whether a premium is ultimately paid; • extending malpractice and other liability for medical and other decisions from providers to health plans; • imposing liability for negligent denials or delays in coverage; • requiring • coverage of experimental procedures and drugs, • direct access to specialists for patients with chronic conditions, • direct access to specialists (including OB/GYNs) and chiropractors, • direct payment of certain providers (whether or not such providers are participants, e.g., ambulance providers), • expanded consumer disclosures and notices and expanded coverage for emergency services, • liberalized definitions of medical necessity, • liberalized internal and external grievance and appeal procedures (including expedited decision making), • point of service benefits for HMO plans, and • payment of claims within specified time frames or payment of interest on claims that are not paid within those time frames; • prohibiting • so-called “gag” and similar clauses in physician agreements, • incentives based on utilization, and • limitations of arrangements designed to manage medical costs such as capitalized arrangements with providers or provider financial incentives; • regulating and restricting the use of utilization management and review; • restricting our ability to recover overpayments from health care providers; • restricting health plans’ use of different fee schedules for different types of health care providers; • regulating and monitoring the composition of provider networks, such as “any willing provider” and pharmacy laws (which generally provide that providers and pharmacies cannot be denied participation in a managed care plan where the providers and pharmacies are willing to abide by the terms and the conditions of that plan); • imposing payment levels for out-of-network care and restricting the application of lifetime benefit limitations and other limits to mental health benefits with parity; 18 • exempting physicians from the antitrust laws that prohibit price fixing, group boycotts and other horizontal restraints on competition; • restricting the use of health plan claims information; • restricting the ability to refuse to honor assignment of benefits made so that non-network providers can be paid directly; • regulating procedures that protect the confidentiality of health and financial information; • implementation of a state-run single payer system; • imposing third-party review of denials of benefits (including denials based on a lack of medical necessity); • allowing entry of Multiple Employer Welfare Associations and Association Health Plans into group markets without regulation comparable to regulation of insurers; • limiting an insurer’s withdrawal from and reentry to market segments; and • restricting or eliminating the use of formularies for prescription drugs. The health benefits business also may be adversely impacted by court and regulatory decisions that expand the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations. It is uncertain whether we can recoup, through higher premiums or other measures, the increased costs of mandated benefits or other increased costs caused by potential legislation or regulation. In connection with the WHN merger, certain of our subsidiaries in California and Georgia executed undertakings with the California Department of Managed Health Care, the California Department of Insurance and the Georgia Department of Insurance which contained various commitments, including the commitment to provide $61.5 million of support for health benefit programs in those states. Additional undertakings include the requirement to maintain certain capital levels at those subsidiaries. Small Group Reform All of the principal states in which we do business have enacted statutes that limit the flexibility of us and other health insurers relative to their small group underwriting and rating practices. Commonly referred to as “small group reform” statutes, these laws are generally consistent with model laws originally introduced by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC. The NAIC’s Small Group Health Insurance Availability Model Act is a model law that limits the differentials in rates carriers can charge between new business and health insurance renewal business, and with respect to small groups with similar demographic characteristics (commonly referred to as a “rating law”). It also requires that insurers disclose to customers the basis on which the insurer establishes new business and renewal rates, restricts the applicability of pre-existing condition exclusions and prohibits an insurer from terminating coverage of an employer group because of the adverse claims experience of that group. The model law provides for a voluntary reinsurance mechanism to spread the risk of high risk employees among all small group carriers participating in the reinsurance mechanism. Our representatives actively participated in the committees of the NAIC, which drafted and proposed this model law. NAIC model laws are not applicable to the industry until adopted by individual states, and there is significant variation in the degree to which states adopt and/or alter NAIC model laws. Some, if not all, of these rating and underwriting limitations are present in small group reform statutes currently adopted in all of the principal states in which we do business. Underwriting Limitations. In the past, insurance companies were free to select and reject risks based on a number of factors, including the medical condition of the person seeking to become insured. Small group health insurers were free to accept some employees and reject other employees for coverage within one employer group. An insurance company was also free to exclude from coverage medical conditions existing within a group which 19 the insurance company believed represented an unacceptable risk level. Also, for the most part, insurance companies were free to cancel coverage of a group due to the medical conditions which were present in that group. Additionally, a new employee seeking medical coverage under an existing group plan could be either accepted or rejected for coverage, or could have coverage excluded or delayed for existing medical conditions. The small group health insurance reform laws limit or abolish a number of these commonly utilized practices to address a societal need to extend availability of insurance coverage more broadly to those who were previously not eligible for coverage. Rating Limitations. Prior to the adoption of state rate reform laws, there was very limited regulation of the rating practices used in the small group health insurance market. There was virtually no regulation of the amount by which one group’s rate could vary from that of a demographically similar group with different claims experience, and there was no statutorily placed limit on the extent and frequency of rate increases that could be applied to any one employer group. All of the principal states in which we do business have enacted rating laws. These laws are designed to reduce the variation in rates charged to insured groups who have favorable and unfavorable claims experience. They also limit the extent and frequency of rate increases. A common rate reform regulation is a pure community rating requirement, pursuant to which all persons in a geographic region would receive the same rate for the same coverage as any other person, without consideration of demographic factors such as age, gender, geographic location, medical risk or occupation. Most existing rating laws also impose a limit on the extent and frequency of a group’s rate increases. At least one state has enacted small group rate regulation that requires the carrier to choose between detailed rate review similar to the review of individual rates or acceptance of minimum loss ratio requirements. Small Group Statutory Reinsurance Mechanisms At this time, our Connecticut and New Hampshire plans are subject to involuntary assessments from small group reinsurance mechanisms within these states. Our plan in New Hampshire is subject to two risk sharing mechanisms. One is an assessment to fund a newly created high risk pool in the individual market. Our New Hampshire plan is also subject to a soon to lapse assessment mechanism to contribute an amount sufficient to cover the expenses and losses of writers of individual products. These mechanisms are designed to provide risk-spreading mechanisms for insurers doing business in jurisdictions that mandate that health insurance be issued on a guarantee issue basis. Guarantee issue requirements increase underwriting risk for insurers by forcing them to accept higher-risk business than they would normally accept. This reinsurance mechanism allows the insurer to cede this high-risk business to the reinsurance facility, thus sharing the underwriting experience with all insurers in the state. Connecticut and New Hampshire statutes subject insurance companies doing business in those jurisdictions to assessments to fund losses from the reinsurance mechanisms. Indiana, Ohio and Nevada statutes provide voluntary reinsurance mechanisms in which the assessment is against only those carriers electing to participate in the reinsurance mechanism. We have elected not to participate in these voluntary reinsurance mechanisms in Indiana and Ohio; however, we do participate in Nevada. Kentucky, Colorado, Maine and Virginia do not have a small group reinsurance mechanism. We also offer Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare approved drug discount cards in certain geographic regions. Our Medicare Advantage plans provide Medicare beneficiaries with a managed care alternative to traditional Medicare. Our Medicare approved drug discount cards affords Medicare beneficiaries, without prescription drug coverage, access to our drug discounts. Medicare Changes In 1997, the federal government passed legislation related to Medicare that changed the method for determining premiums that the government pays to HMOs for Medicare members. In general, the new method has reduced the premiums payable to us compared to the old method, although the level and extent of the 20 reductions varies by geographic market and depends on other factors. The legislation also requires us to pay a “user fee.” The changes began to be phased in on January 1, 1998 and continued over five years. The federal government also announced in 1999 that it planned to begin to phase in risk adjustments to its premium payments over a five-year period commencing January 1, 2000. While we cannot predict exactly what effect these Medicare reforms will have on our results of operations, we anticipate that the net impact of the risk adjustments will be to reduce the premiums payable to us. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 became law in December 2003 and expanded Medicare, primarily adding a prescription drug benefit for Medicare-eligible retirees starting in 2006. HIPAA and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA and its regulations, like other small group health insurance laws, impose obligations for issuers of health insurance coverage and health benefit plan sponsors. This law requires guaranteed health care coverage for small employers having 2 to 50 employees and for individuals who meet certain eligibility requirements. It also requires guaranteed renewability of health care coverage for most employers and individuals. The law limits exclusions based on preexisting conditions for individuals covered under group policies to the extent the individuals had prior creditable coverage, and the gap between the prior coverage and the new coverage cannot exceed certain time frames. In addition to the portability component of HIPAA, HIPAA authorized the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, known as HHS, to issue standards for administrative simplification, as well as privacy and security of medical records and other individually identifiable patient data. HIPAA requirements apply to health care providers that transmit health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA Standard Transaction, as well as to health plans (including insurers and HMOs) and health care clearinghouses (collectively referred to as “Covered Entities”). Privacy and Security Regulations adopted to implement HIPAA also require that Covered Entities obligate their business associates to follow HIPAA standards. Although HIPAA was intended ultimately to reduce administrative expenses and burdens faced within the health care industry, we believe the law has initially brought about significant and, in some cases, costly changes. HHS has released three rules to date mandating the use of new standards with respect to certain health care transactions, including health information. The first rule requires the use of uniform standards for common electronic health care transactions, including health care claims information, plan eligibility, referral certification and authorization, claims status, plan enrollment and disenrollment, payment and remittance advice, plan premium payments and coordination of benefits, and it establishes standards for the use of electronic signatures. The new transaction standards became effective in October 2000. Originally, almost all Covered Entities were required to comply with these standards by October 16, 2002. However, legislation was enacted in December 2001 giving Covered Entities the option of extending their compliance date to October 16, 2003, provided that a filing was made with HHS prior to October 16, 2002. We took advantage of the extension and met our compliance obligations by October 16, 2003. Another rule established a standard for a unique employer identifier to be used in covered electronic transactions. This rule became effective in July 2002. Most Covered Entities were required to comply with this rule by July 30, 2004 and we met our compliance obligation on or before that date. A third rule establishes a national provider identifier to be used in covered electronic transactions. This rule becomes effective in May 2005. Most Covered Entities are required to comply with this rule by May 23, 2007. Additional standard transactions, such as claim attachment standards, are currently under development by HHS. HHS also has developed new standards relating to the privacy of individually identifiable health information or protected health information. In general, these regulations restrict the use and disclosure of medical records and other individually identifiable health information held or disclosed by Covered Entities in any form, whether communicated electronically, on paper or orally, subject only to limited exceptions. In addition, the regulations 21 provide patients with some significant new rights to understand and control how their health information is used, and imposed a number of administrative requirements on Covered Entities. These regulations do not preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may apply to us. Most Covered Entities were required to comply with Privacy Regulations by April 14, 2003 (small health plans were given an additional year to comply). We complied timely with the privacy standards. HHS also issued Security Regulations containing standards that established administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information that a covered entity creates, receives, maintains or transmits, protects against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, and protects against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of such information that are not permitted or required under the Privacy Regulation. Most Covered Entities must comply with the Security Regulations by April 20, 2005, and we expect to be in compliance on or before that date. Other federal legislation includes the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which generally placed restrictions on the disclosure of non-public information to non-affiliated third parties, and required financial institutions including insurers, to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal information is used, including an opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures. The federal law required state departments of insurance, and certain federal agencies, to adopt implementing regulations, and as such, there has been a great deal of activity at the state and federal level. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also gives banks and other financial institutions the ability to affiliate with insurance companies, which may lead to new competitors in the insurance and health benefits fields. Investment and Retirement Products and Services We are subject to regulation on investment and retirement products and services by various government agencies where we conduct business, including the insurance departments of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Puerto Rico, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Among other matters, these agencies may regulate premium rates, trade practices, agent licensing, policy forms, underwriting and claims practices, the maximum interest rates that can be charged on life insurance policy loans, and the minimum rates that must be provided for accumulation of surrender value. ERISA The provision of services to certain employee welfare benefit plans is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, a complex set of laws and regulations subject to interpretation and enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor, or DOL. ERISA regulates certain aspects of the relationships between us, the employers who maintain employee welfare benefit plans subject to ERISA and participants in such plans. Some of our administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under ERISA. In addition, some states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims administration services for benefit plans. We provide a variety of products and services to employee welfare benefit plans that are covered by ERISA. ERISA prevents ERISA welfare benefit plans from being subject to certain state laws. However, ERISA does not prevent the application of state laws that regulate the business of insurance. The question of whether a state law regulates the business of insurance remains open to interpretation by the courts. In 2002, the United States Supreme Court held that insured health plans provided to employers under ERISA must still comply with state insurance laws which give patients the right to independent external review of medical coverage decisions. Recently, the United States Supreme Court unanimously held that ERISA preempted state law claims against insurers that conflicted with ERISA civil enforcement remedies where insurers use medical judgment to decide a contractual benefit under a welfare benefit plan. This decision settles some open issues regarding ERISA preemption of state laws; however, it is too soon to tell what impact, if any, there will be on our business. The United States Supreme Court has also held that a state’s any willing provider law applies to insured ERISA plans. 22 In 2001, the DOL promulgated regulations under ERISA setting out standards for claim payment and member appeals along with associated notice and disclosure requirements. These rules became effective for employers with plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2002 for disability plans and July 1, 2002 for health plans. HMO and Insurance Holding Company Laws We are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled. These acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or HMO and its affiliates. These holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and HMOs within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states’ insurance departments certain reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. In addition, various notice and reporting requirements generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and HMOs and their affiliates within an insurance holding company system, depending on the size and nature of the transactions. Some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or, in certain circumstances, prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies, HMOs, their parent holding companies and affiliates. Additionally, the holding company acts for the states of domicile of our regulated subsidiaries restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company. “Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person. Guaranty Fund Assessments Under insolvency or guaranty association laws in most states, insurance companies can be assessed for amounts paid by guaranty funds for policyholder losses incurred when an insurance company becomes insolvent. Most state insolvency or guaranty association laws currently provide for assessments based upon the amount of premiums received on insurance underwritten within such state (with a minimum amount payable even if no premium is received). Substantially all of our premiums are currently derived from insurance underwritten in the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. Under many of these guaranty association laws, assessments against insurance companies that issue policies of accident or sickness insurance are made retrospectively and are based (up to prescribed percentage of premium limits) upon the ratio of (i) the insurance company’s premiums received in the applicable state over the previous three calendar years on accident and sickness insurance to (ii) the aggregate amount of premiums received by all assessed member insurance companies over such three calendar years on accident and sickness insurance. The guaranty fund assessments made under these acts are administered by the state’s guaranty association, which has its own board of directors selected by member insurers with the approval of the state insurance department. In general, an assessment may be abated or deferred by the guaranty association if, in the opinion of the board of the guaranty association, payment would endanger the ability of the member to fulfill its contractual obligations. The other member insurers, however, may be assessed for the amount of such abatement or deferral. All or a portion of such assessment paid by a member insurance company may be offset against its premium tax liability to the state in question over a multiple year period (generally five to 10 years) following the year in which the assessment was paid. The amount and timing of any future assessments, however, cannot be reasonably estimated and are beyond our control. 23 While the amount of any assessments applicable to life and health guaranty funds cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that future guaranty association assessments for insurer insolvencies will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources. Risk-Based Capital Requirements The states of domicile of our regulated subsidiaries have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies based on the RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to assess the capital adequacy of life and health insurers, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The RBC Model Act sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under these laws, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the insurance department or insurance commissioner of its state of domicile for each calendar year. The RBC Model Act provides for four different levels of regulatory attention depending on the ratio of a company’s total adjusted capital (defined as the total of its statutory capital, surplus and asset valuation reserve) to its risk-based capital. The “Company Action Level” is triggered if a company’s total adjusted capital is less than 200 percent but greater than or equal to 150 percent of its risk-based capital. At the “Company Action Level”, a company must submit a comprehensive plan to the regulatory authority which discusses proposed corrective actions to improve its capital position. A company whose total adjusted capital is between 250 percent and 200 percent of its risk-based capital is subject to a trend test. The trend test calculates the greater of any decrease in the margin (i.e., the amount in dollars by which a company’s adjusted capital exceeds its risk-based capital) between the current year and the prior year and between the current year and the average of the past three years, and assumes that the decrease could occur again in the coming year. If a similar decrease in margin in the coming year would result in a risk-based capital ratio of less than 190 percent, then “Company Action Level” regulatory action would be triggered. The “Regulatory Action Level” is triggered if a company’s total adjusted capital is less than 150 percent but greater than or equal to 100 percent of its risk-based capital. At the “Regulatory Action Level”, the regulatory authority will perform a special examination of the company and issue an order specifying corrective actions that must be followed. The “Authorized Control Level” is triggered if a company’s total adjusted capital is less than 100 percent but greater than or equal to 70 percent of its risk-based capital, at which level the regulatory authority may take any action it deems necessary, including placing the company under regulatory control. The “Mandatory Control Level” is triggered if a company’s total adjusted capital is less than 70 percent of its risk-based capital, at which level the regulatory authority is mandated to place the company under its control. The law requires increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company’s RBC declines. The level of regulatory oversight ranges from requiring the insurance company to inform and obtain approval from the domiciling insurance commissioner of a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its RBC, to mandatory regulatory intervention requiring an insurance company to be placed under regulatory control in a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding. As of December 31, 2004, the RBC levels of our insurance subsidiaries exceeded all RBC thresholds. NAIC IRIS Ratios The NAIC requires review of financial relationships or “tests” called the Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, that were designed for early identification of companies that may require special attention by insurance regulatory authorities. Insurance companies submit statutory financial data on an annual basis to the NAIC, which in turn analyzes the data using ratios covering eleven categories of data with defined “usual ranges” for each category. An insurance company may fall out of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific transactions or events that are, in and of themselves, immaterial. Generally, an insurance company will become subject to regulatory scrutiny if its IRIS results fall outside of the usual ranges on four or more of 24 the ratios. If a company is outside the ranges on four or more of the ratios, a written explanation is prepared and sent to regulators. None of our insurance subsidiaries is currently subject to regulatory scrutiny based on IRIS ratios. Employees At December 31, 2004, we had approximately 38,000 persons employed on a full-time basis. As of December 31, 2004, a small portion of employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements: approximately 143 employees in the Sacramento, California area with the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 29; approximately 169 employees in the greater Detroit, Michigan area with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, Local No. 614; and approximately 190 employees in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 9. Our employees are an important asset, and we seek to develop them to their full potential. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. Our principal executive offices are located at 120 Monument Circle, Indianapolis, Indiana. In addition to this property, following the merger with WellPoint Health Networks Inc., we have offices located at 1 WellPoint Way, Thousand Oaks, California that house certain corporate and specialty services. These properties are being leased. In addition, in order to conduct our operations, which have expanded nationally due to our mergers and acquisitions, we lease or own offices in various other locations, including the greater Los Angeles, California area; Denver, Colorado; North Haven, Connecticut; Atlanta and Columbus, Georgia; Manchester, New Hampshire; the greater Chicago, Illinois area; Indianapolis, Indiana; Louisville, Kentucky; South Portland, Maine; Charlestown and Andover, Massachusetts; Dearborn, Michigan; St. Louis, Missouri; Mason/Cincinnati, Ohio; Worthington/Columbus, Ohio; Houston and Plano, Texas; Richmond, Virginia and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We believe that our properties are adequate and suitable for our business as presently conducted. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Litigation In May 2000, a case titled California Medical Association vs. Blue Cross of California, et. al., was filed in U.S. district court in San Francisco against Blue Cross of California (“BCC”), one of WHN’s subsidiaries. The lawsuit alleges that BCC violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”) (the “CMA Litigation”). In August 2000, WHN was added as a party to Shane v. Humana, et al., a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of health care providers nationwide alleging RICO violations (the “Shane Litigation”). Effective November 30, 2004, WHN merged with Anthem Holding Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In October 2000, the federal Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“MDL”) issued an order consolidating the CMA Litigation, the Shane lawsuit and various other pending managed care class-action lawsuits against other companies before District Court Judge Federico Moreno in the Southern District of Florida for purposes of pretrial proceedings (hereinafter collectively “MDL Cases”). A mediator has been appointed by Judge Moreno and the parties are currently conducting court-ordered mediation. On December 9, 2004, Judge Moreno issued a new scheduling order extending the expert discovery deadline to February 7, 2005 and setting trial for September 6, 2005. On February 11, 2005, the District Court issued an order bifurcating the trial, holding that liability would be determined first, and damages would be tried after liability, if necessary. On September 26, 2002, the Company was added as a defendant to the Shane Litigation. 25 On May 8, 2003, in a case titled Dr. Allen Knecht, et al., v. Cigna, et al., several chiropractors filed a purported class action in federal district court in Portland, Oregon, naming the Company and WHN, as well as several commercial insurers. This suit alleges that the defendants violated RICO and challenges many of the same practices in regards to chiropractors as other suits in the MDL Cases. This case has been transferred to the MDL docket and is now assigned to Judge Moreno in Miami. This case has been stayed as a tag-along case to the MDL Cases. On May 22, 2003, in a case titled Kenneth Thomas, M.D., et al., v. Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, et al., several medical providers filed suit in federal district court in Miami, Florida against the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans across the country, including the Company. The suit alleges that the BCBS Association and the BCBS Plans violated RICO and challenges many of the same practices as other suits in the MDL Cases. This case has been assigned to Judge Moreno in Miami. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification and the defendants have filed motions to dismiss and motions to compel arbitration. All motions are currently pending before Judge Moreno. On October 17, 2003, in a case titled Jeffrey Solomon, D.C., et al., v. Cigna, et al., several chiropractors and a podiatrist, along with chiropractic and podiatric associations, filed suit in federal district court in Miami, Florida, against ten managed care corporations, including the Company. The suit alleges that the companies violated RICO and challenges many of the same practices as other suits in the MDL Cases. This case has been transferred to the MDL docket and is now assigned to Judge Moreno in Miami. This case has been stayed as a tag-along case to the MDL Cases. On November 4, 2003, in a case titled Jeffrey Solomon, D.C., et al., v. Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, et al., several chiropractors, podiatrists, a psychologist and a physical therapist, along with their professional corporations and trade associations, filed suit in federal district court in Miami, Florida against the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans across the country, including the Company. The suit alleges that the BCBS Association and the BCBS Plans violated RICO and challenges many of the same practices as other suits in the MDL Cases. This case has been transferred to the MDL docket and is now assigned to Judge Moreno in Miami. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification and the defendants have filed motions to dismiss and motions to compel arbitration. All motions are currently pending before Judge Moreno. On February 23, 2004, in a case titled Richard Freiberg, et al., v. United Healthcare, Inc., et al., an acupuncturist and an association promoting acupuncture filed suit in federal court in Miami, Florida against ten managed care corporations, including the Company. The complaint purports to be a class action filed on behalf of all non-physician health care providers, and alleges that the companies involved violated RICO, and challenges many of the same practices as other suits in the MDL Cases. This case has been transferred to the MDL docket and assigned to Judge Moreno. This case has been stayed as a tag-along case to the MDL Cases. On March 11, 1998, Anthem Insurance Companies, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and its Ohio subsidiary, Community Insurance Company (“CIC”) were named as defendants in a lawsuit, Robert Lee Dardinger, Executor of the Estate of Esther Louise Dardinger v. Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, et al., filed in Newark, Ohio. The plaintiff sought compensatory damages and unspecified punitive damages in connection with claims alleging wrongful death, bad faith and negligence arising out of CIC’s denial of certain claims for medical treatment for Ms. Dardinger. In December 2001, CIC paid $2.5 in compensatory damages for bad faith and $1,350 (actual dollars) for breach of contract, plus accrued interest. In March 2003, Anthem Insurance and CIC paid punitive damages of $30.0 plus interest. Following the March 2003 payment and Satisfaction of Judgment, the Company released pretax reserves of $24.5 to income, which resulted in an after tax benefit of $0.11 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2003. On June 27, 2002, in a case titled Academy of Medicine of Cincinnati and Luis Pagani, M.D. v. Aetna Health, Inc., Humana Health Plan of Ohio, Inc., Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and United Health Care of Ohio, Inc., No. A02004947 filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Hamilton County, Ohio and a case titled Academy of Medicine of Cincinnati and A. Lee Greiner, M.D., Victor Schmelzer, M.D., and Karl S. Ulicny, Jr., 26 M.D. v. Aetna Health, Inc., Humana, Inc., Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and United Health Care, Inc., No. 02-CI-903 filed in the Boone County, Kentucky Circuit Court, the Academy and certain physicians allege that the defendants acted in combination and collusion with one another to reduce the reimbursement rates paid to physicians in the area and as a direct result of the defendants’ alleged anti-competitive actions, health care in the area has suffered, namely that: there are fewer hospitals; physicians are rapidly leaving the area; medical practices are unable to hire new physicians; and, from the perspective of the public, the availability of health care has been significantly reduced. Each suit seeks class certification, compensatory damages, attorneys’ fees, and injunctive relief to prevent the alleged anti-competitive behavior against the class in the future. The Company is awaiting a decision from the Ohio Supreme Court in connection with procedural motions filed by the defendants. Defendants are seeking a discretionary review with the Kentucky Supreme Court on procedural motions, and filed their petition on February 10, 2005. These suits are in the preliminary stages. On March 26, 2003, in a case titled Irwin v. AdvancePCS, et al. filed in the California Superior Court in Alameda County, California against Advance PCS, WHN and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants violated California Business and Professions Code Section 17200 by engaging in unfair, fraudulent and unlawful business practices including, among other things, that pharmacy benefit management companies (such as the Company’s subsidiary that does business under the tradename WellPoint Pharmacy Management) engage in unfair practices such as negotiating discounts in prices of drugs from pharmacies and negotiating rebates from drug manufacturers and retaining such discounts and rebates for their own benefit. On July 9, 2004, the court ordered that the case be resolved in arbitration. The Company intends to vigorously defend all these proceedings; however, their ultimate outcomes cannot presently be determined. Prior to the Company’s acquisition of the group benefit operations (“GBO”), John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company (“John Hancock”) entered into a number of reinsurance arrangements with respect to personal accident insurance and the occupational accident component of workers’ compensation insurance, a portion of which was originated through a pool managed by Unicover Managers, Inc. Under these arrangements, John Hancock assumed risks as a reinsurer and transferred certain of such risks to other companies. These arrangements have become the subject of disputes, including a number of legal proceedings to which John Hancock is a party. The Company is currently in arbitration with John Hancock regarding these arrangements. The Company believes that it has a number of defenses to avoid any ultimate liability with respect to these matters and believes that such liabilities were not transferred to the Company as part of the GBO acquisition. However, if the Company were to become subject to such liabilities, the Company could suffer losses that might have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. On October 28, 2003 a case titled Abrams v. WellPoint Health Networks Inc., et al., was filed in the Superior Court of Ventura County, California against WHN and its board of directors alleging that WHN’s directors breached their fiduciary duties to stockholders by approving an Agreement and Plan of Merger with the Company while in possession of non-public information regarding WHN’s financial results for the third quarter of 2003. The lawsuit sought to enjoin WHN from consummating the merger with the Company, unless WHN adopted and implemented a process for obtaining the highest possible price for stockholders, and to rescind any terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger that have already been implemented. On May 7, 2004, WHN and the plaintiff signed a memorandum of understanding regarding a potential settlement of the action, in which WHN agreed to provide certain additional disclosures on several matters in the joint proxy statement/prospectus sent to WHN’s stockholders beyond those contained in the preliminary proxy statement/prospectus. The settlement would also provide for the payment by WHN of $2.25 million to the plaintiff’s counsel for fees and costs (subject to court approval). No part of the settlement costs will be paid by the WHN directors individually. The settlement would not involve any admissions of breaches of fiduciary duty or other wrongdoing by WHN or any of its directors. The settlement and payment of the plaintiff’s counsel fees would be conditioned upon, among other things, completion of the merger. The settlement agreement was presented to the Superior Court judge assigned to the matter, on January 11, 2005. The judge preliminarily approved the settlement, and scheduled a hearing to consider final approval to take place on July 7, 2005. 27 Other Contingencies The Company serves as a fiscal intermediary for Medicare Parts A and B. The fiscal intermediaries for these programs receive reimbursement for certain costs and expenditures, which is subject to adjustment upon audit by the Federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, formerly the Health Care Financing Administration. The laws and regulations governing fiscal intermediaries for the Medicare program are complex, subject to interpretation and can expose an intermediary to penalties for non-compliance. Fiscal intermediaries may be subject to criminal fines, civil penalties or other sanctions as a result of such audits or reviews. While the Company believes it is currently in compliance in all material respects with the regulations governing fiscal intermediaries, there are ongoing reviews by the federal government of the Company’s activities under certain of its Medicare fiscal intermediary contracts. From time to time, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, many of which involve claims for coverage encountered in the ordinary course of business. The Company, like HMOs and health insurers generally, excludes certain health care services from coverage under its HMO, PPO and other plans. The Company is, in its ordinary course of business, subject to the claims of its enrollees arising out of decisions to restrict treatment or reimbursement for certain services. The loss of even one such claim, if it results in a significant punitive damage award, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, the risk of potential liability under punitive damage theories may increase significantly the difficulty of obtaining reasonable settlements of coverage claims. In addition to the lawsuits described above, the Company is also involved in other pending and threatened litigation of the character incidental to the business transacted, arising out of its insurance and investment operations, and is from time to time involved as a party in various governmental investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings. These investigations, audits and reviews include routine and special investigations by state insurance departments, state attorneys general and the U.S. Attorney General. Such investigations could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions. The Company believes that any liability that may result from any one of these actions is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 28 ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS. The Company did not submit any matters to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2004. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. Market Prices The Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “WLP”. On March 1, 2005, the closing price on the NYSE was $121.88. As of March 1, 2005, there were 166,845 shareholders of record of the Common Stock. The following table presents high and low sales prices for the Common Stock on the NYSE for the periods indicated. High Low 2004 First Quarter $ 92.13 $ 72.50 Second Quarter 95.60 83.85 Third Quarter 93.90 77.76 Fourth Quarter 117.70 72.20 2003 First Quarter $ 67.13 $ 53.00 Second Quarter 82.90 63.80 Third Quarter 82.00 66.01 Fourth Quarter 77.96 64.75 Dividends No cash dividends have been paid on our common stock. The declaration and payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and must comply with applicable law. Future dividend payments will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, potential acquisitions, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. In addition, we are a holding company whose primary assets are 100% of the capital stock of Anthem Insurance Companies, Inc., Anthem Southeast, Inc., and Anthem Holding Corp. Our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, if authorized by our board of directors, is primarily dependent upon the receipt of dividends from these companies and their receipt of dividends from our other regulated insurance subsidiaries.

With the adoption of FAS 142, we ceased amortization of goodwill. The intangible assets established for Blue Cross and Blue Shield trademarks are deemed to have indefinite lives, and beginning January 1, 2002, are no longer amortized. Net income and earnings per share on a comparable basis as if FAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000, are as follows: 2001 2000 Net income adjusted for FAS 142 $ 357.3 $ 238.5 Basic earnings per share adjusted for FAS 142 3.46 2.32 Diluted earnings per share adjusted for FAS 142 3.44 2.31 5 There were no shares or dilutive securities outstanding prior to November 2, 2001 (date of Anthem Insurance Companies, Inc.’s demutualization and initial public offering). Accordingly, amounts prior to 2002 represent pro forma earnings per share. For comparative pro forma earnings per share presentation, the weighted-average shares outstanding and the effect of dilutive securities for the period from November 2, 2001 to December 31, 2001 was used to calculate pro forma earnings per share for all periods prior to 2002. 6 The benefit expense ratio represents benefit expense as a percentage of premium revenue. The selling, general and administrative expense ratio represents selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of operating revenue. 7 Represents policyholders’ surplus prior to the demutualization on November 2, 2001.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates IX. Liquidity and Capital Resources X. Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 I. Overview We are the nation’s largest publicly traded health benefits company in terms of membership, providing health benefit services to more than 27.7 million members as of December 31, 2004, and we operate as an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA. We are the Blue Cross licensee in California and a Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensee in 12 other states: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Virginia (excluding the immediate suburbs of Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. We also serve customers throughout various parts of the country as HealthLink and UniCare. Our Health Care segment includes strategic business units delineated primarily by geographic areas within which we offer similar products and services, including commercial accounts, senior and Medicaid. We offer a diversified mix of managed care products, including preferred provider organizations or PPOs, health maintenance organizations or HMOs, traditional indemnity benefits and point of service or POS plans. We also offer a variety of hybrid benefit plans, including consumer directed, hospital only and limited benefit products. Additionally, we provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers, including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management and other administrative services. Our Specialty segment is comprised of businesses providing pharmacy benefit management, group life and disability insurance benefits, dental, workers’ compensation and long-term care insurance. We also provide vision and behavioral health benefits services. Our Other segment is comprised of our Medicare processing business, including AdminaStar Federal and United Government Services; Arcus Enterprises; intersegment revenue and expense eliminations; and corporate expenses not allocated to our Health Care or Specialty segments. Our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. The premiums come from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. Our administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, where the fee is based on either processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized. Additionally, we earn operating revenues from our Medicare processing business and from other health-related businesses including disease management programs. Other revenue is principally generated from member co-payments and deductibles associated with the mail-order sale of drugs by our pharmacy benefit management companies. Our benefit expense includes costs of care for health services consumed by our members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical 32 procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the subsequent reporting periods. Our selling expense consists of external broker commission expenses, and generally varies with premium volume. Our general and administrative expense consists of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Other costs are variable or discretionary in nature. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium, but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels, and thus salary and benefit expense. Discretionary costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity. Our cost of drugs consists of the amounts we pay to pharmaceutical companies for the drugs we sell via mail order through our pharmacy benefit management companies, or PBM. This amount excludes the cost of drugs related to affiliated health customers recorded in benefit expense. Our cost of drugs can be influenced by the volume of prescriptions at our PBM, as well as cost changes, driven by prices set by pharmaceutical companies and mix of drugs sold. Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management programs. Several economic factors related to health care costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage and direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating health care costs as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material impact on our results of operations. This management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, included in this Form 10-K. II. Significant Transactions On November 30, 2004, Anthem, Inc. and WellPoint Health Networks Inc., or WHN, completed their merger. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the stockholders of WHN (other than subsidiaries of WHN) received consideration of twenty-three dollars and eighty cents ($23.80) in cash and one share of Anthem, Inc. common stock for each WHN share outstanding. In addition, WHN stock options and other awards were converted to WellPoint, Inc. awards in accordance with the merger agreement. The purchase price including cash, fair value of stock and stock awards and estimated transaction costs was approximately $16.0 billion. Anthem, Inc., the surviving corporate parent, was renamed WellPoint, Inc. concurrent with the merger. III. Membership—December 31, 2004 Compared to December 31, 2003 Our medical membership includes six different customer types: Large Group, Individual and Small Group, National Accounts, BlueCard Host, Senior and State Sponsored. • Large Group consists of those employer customers with 51 to 4,999 employees eligible to participate as a member in one of our health plans. Large Group also includes members in the Federal Employee 33 Program, or FEP, which provides health insurance coverage to United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. • Individual and Small Group, or ISG, consists of individual customers under age 65 as well as those employer customers with one to 50 eligible employees. • National Accounts customers are multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in a WellPoint service area with 5,000 or more eligible employees, with at least 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarters state. • BlueCard host members represent enrollees of non-owned Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans who receive health care services in our Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensed markets. • Senior members are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a managed care alternative for the Medicare program, or who have purchased Medicare supplement benefit coverage. • State Sponsored membership represents eligible members with state sponsored managed care alternatives in Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance programs. BlueCard membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer sponsored health plan issued by a non-WellPoint controlled Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee (i.e., the “home” plan). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard claims received per member per month. In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain some or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some employers choose to purchase stop-loss coverage to limit their retained risk. These employers are reported with our self-funded business. The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and geographical region as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. Also included below are key metrics from our Specialty segment, including prescription volume for our PBM and membership by product. The membership data presented is unaudited and in certain instances includes estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period, rounded to the nearest thousand.

Historical results have been reclassified to conform to current presentation. 2 “Comparable” statistics were calculated by adding historical statistics for the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc. to historical statistics for the former Anthem, Inc., and adjusting the combined totals to assure a consistent approach for calculating membership and volume statistics and to eliminate overlapping BlueCard host membership. 3 Includes our UniCare and HealthLink membership. 4 Includes 74,742 members of Unity Health Plans Insurance Company which was sold effective January 1, 2005. 5 Represents prescription volume for mail order and retail prescriptions for the full years ended 2004 and 2003, respectively. Prescription volume for 2004 and 2003 is shown on a “comparable” basis. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, total comparable medical membership increased approximately 1,678,000, or 6%, primarily in our National Accounts, BlueCard, and ISG businesses. Our National Accounts comparable membership increased 544,000, or 20%, primarily due to recognition of the value of Blue Cross and Blue Shield networks and the discounts we can secure, the breadth of our product offerings, and our distinctive customer service. BlueCard comparable membership increased 532,000, or 18%, representing increased sales by other Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees to accounts with members who reside in or travel to our licensed areas. ISG comparable membership increased 332,000, or 7%, primarily due to the introduction of new, more affordable product designs and an overall increase in consumer awareness of our wide variety of quality products and services as well as efforts to market products to the uninsured. Self-funded comparable medical membership increased 1,289,000, or 11%, primarily due to increases in our National Accounts and BlueCard businesses. Fully-insured comparable membership increased by 389,000 members, or 3%, primarily in our ISG business. Prescription volume at our PBM increased 36,911,000 prescriptions, or 12%, on a comparable basis in 2004 primarily due to the integration of our Virginia health membership to our internal PBM, as well as increased mail-order utilization and growth within our other existing health lines of business. 35 Behavioral Health comparable membership increased 1,369,000, or 13%, in 2004 primarily due to HealthLink network growth, the integration of our Maine health customers which were previously serviced by an external vendor, and growth within our other existing health lines of business. Dental comparable membership decreased 243,000, or 5%, in 2004 primarily due to the loss of two specific large accounts. Vision comparable membership increased 342,000, or 79%, due to the integration of internal health members, as well as increased sales. IV. Cost of Care The following discussion summarizes our aggregate cost of care trends for the full year 2004 for our Large Group and ISG fully-insured businesses only. Cost of care information as discussed below is presented as if pre-merger Anthem, Inc. and WHN were combined for all of 2004 and 2003. Accordingly, cost of care reported previously for pre-merger Anthem, Inc. is not comparable to what is presented below. Our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing the year over year change in average per member per month claim costs for which we are responsible, which excludes member co-payments and deductibles. Our aggregate cost of care trend was just under 10% for 2004. Costs for outpatient services and pharmacy continued to be the primary drivers of overall cost trends. Outpatient services cost trend increases were primarily driven by higher per visit costs as more procedures are being performed during each visit to an outpatient provider, particularly emergency room visits, as well as the impact of price increases included within certain provider contracts. Pharmacy benefit cost trend increases were primarily driven by price increases on existing brand drugs and, to a lesser extent, the introduction of new, higher cost drugs. Price increases on existing brand drugs have been seen particularly in those therapeutic classes of drugs designed to reduce cholesterol and anti-depressants, our two largest categories of drugs based on overall expenses. In response to cost trends, we continue to pursue contracting and plan design changes, promote and implement performance-based contracts that reward clinical outcomes and quality, and expand our disease management and advanced care management programs. In addition, we continually evaluate our drug formulary to ensure the most effective pharmaceutical therapies are available for our members. Late in the third quarter of 2004, the arthritis drug VIOXX® was removed from the market due to concerns about the risk of heart attacks in persons taking this drug for longer than 18 months. We have provided our network physicians with information regarding alternatives to VIOXX and our PBM has implemented a process to ensure appropriate usage of the COX 2 Inhibitor therapeutic class of drugs. Despite the reported shortage of flu vaccine early in the 2004 – 2005 flu season, we have not seen an increase in hospital admissions, physician office visits and use of anti-viral drugs that would indicate a severe flu season in the fourth quarter of 2004. We are beginning to see an increase in these indications in early 2005. 36 V. Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: Year Ended1 December 31 Change 2004 2003 $ % ($ in Millions, Except Per Share Data) Premiums $ 18,771.6 $ 15,167.7 $ 3,603.9 24 % Administrative fees 1,436.9 1,160.2 276.7 24 Other revenue 252.4 159.2 93.2 59 Total operating revenue 20,460.9 16,487.1 3,973.8 24 Net investment income 311.7 278.1 33.6 12 Net realized gains on investments 42.5 16.2 26.3 NM2 Total revenue 20,815.1 16,781.4 4,033.7 24 Benefit expense 15,387.8 12,254.5 3,133.3 26 Selling, general and administrative expense: Selling expense 537.2 411.2 126.0 31 General and administrative expense 2,940.5 2,686.3 254.2 9 Total selling, general and administrative expense 3,477.7 3,097.5 380.2 12 Cost of drugs 95.0 38.7 56.3 NM2 Interest expense 142.3 131.2 11.1 8 Amortization of other intangible assets 61.4 47.6 13.8 29 Merger-related undertakings 61.5 — 61.5 NM2 Loss on repurchase of debt 146.1 — 146.1 NM2 Total expense 19,371.8 15,569.5 3,802.3 24 Income before income taxes 1,443.3 1,211.9 231.4 19 Income taxes 483.2 437.6 45.6 10 Net income $ 960.1 $ 774.3 $ 185.8 24 % Average diluted shares outstanding (in millions) 157.3 142.0 15.3 11 % Diluted net income per share $ 6.10 $ 5.45 $ 0.65 12 % Benefit expense ratio3 82.0 % 80.8 % 120 bp4 Selling, general and administrative expense ratio5 17.0 % 18.8 % (180) bp4 Income before income taxes as a percentage of total revenue 6.9 % 7.2 % (30) bp4 Net income as a percentage of total revenue 4.6 % 4.6 % — bp4 Certain of the following definitions are also applicable to all other results of operations tables in this discussion: 1 Financial results for 2004 include operations of WHN for the one month period ended December 31, 2004 only. Financial results for 2003 represent the results of the former Anthem, Inc. only and have been reclassified to conform to current presentation. 2 NM = Not meaningful. 3 Benefit expense ratio = Benefit expense ÷ Premiums. 4 bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%. 5 Selling, general and administrative expense ratio = Total selling, general and administrative expense ÷ Total operating revenue. 37 Premiums increased $3,603.9 million, or 24%, to $18,771.6 million in 2004, due to the impact of the merger with WHN, and premium rate increases in our Large Group and ISG businesses. Also contributing to premium growth was higher fully-insured membership, primarily in our ISG business. Partially offsetting the growth were shifts by certain customers to self-funding arrangements, resulting in lower revenues. Included in 2003 were premium refunds of $40.4 million issued to policyholders from our Health Care segment, as claims costs in certain lines of business were much lower than expected. Our premium yields, net of buy-downs, for our fully-insured Large Group and ISG businesses were just less than 10% on a rolling 12-month basis as of December 31, 2004, including the business of pre-merger WHN for all periods. Administrative fees increased $276.7 million, or 24%, to $1,436.9 million in 2004, primarily due to increased revenues from self-funded membership, primarily in National businesses, and also due to the impact of the merger with WHN. These increases were partially offset by decreased administrative fees from AdminaStar Federal’s 1-800 Medicare Help Line contract with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, which was substantially completed by June 30, 2003. Other revenue is comprised principally of co-payments and deductibles associated with the sale of mail-order drugs by our PBM, which provides its services to members of our Health Care segment and third party clients. Other revenue increased $93.2 million, or 59%, to $252.4 million in 2004, primarily due to additional mail-order prescription volume and increased prices of prescription drugs sold by our PBM, and also due to the impact of the merger with WHN. Increased mail-order prescription volume resulted from both membership increases and additional utilization of our PBM’s mail-order pharmacy option. Effective January 1, 2004, our PBM began to provide pharmacy benefit management services to Virginia customers of our Health Care segment. Net investment income increased $33.6 million, or 12%, to $311.7 million in 2004 primarily due to the merger with WHN. Our investment income also increased in 2004 due to the growth in invested assets from reinvestment of cash generated from operations, partially offset by a decrease in yields from new investments. Yields were lower in 2004 due in part to the impact of a portion of our fixed maturity portfolio being invested in shorter duration investments in anticipation of the WHN merger and the use of cash upon completion of the WHN merger on November 30, 2004. Yields were also lower in part due to an increased allocation of tax exempt securities in 2004, which is expected to enhance after tax income. A summary of our net realized gains on investments for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 is as follows: Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 $ Change ($ in Millions) Net realized gains from the sale of fixed maturity securities $ 40.6 $ 41.7 $ (1.1 ) Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities 3.3 0.5 2.8 Other-than-temporary impairments (0.8 ) (24.4 ) 23.6 Other losses (0.6 ) (1.6 ) 1.0 Net realized gains on investments $ 42.5 $ 16.2 $ 26.3 Other-than-temporary impairments recognized in 2003 were substantially related to our equity security investments, primarily due to the length of time that the securities’ fair value had been less than cost. Benefit expense increased $3,133.3 million, or 26%, to $15,387.8 million in 2004. Benefit expense increased due to the impact of the merger with WHN, and also due to increased cost of care, which was driven primarily by higher costs in outpatient services and drug costs. Included in the 2003 results was a $31.7 million 38 net favorable prior year reserve development recorded during the second quarter of 2003 and a $24.5 million favorable adjustment for resolution of a litigation matter in our Health Care segment in the first quarter of 2003. Our benefit expense ratio increased 120 basis points from 80.8% in 2003 to 82.0% in 2004, increasing from lower than anticipated cost of care trends in 2003 and returning to more sustainable levels. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $380.2 million, or 12%, to $3,477.7 million in 2004, primarily due to the impact of the merger with WHN, and also due to increases in volume-sensitive costs such as higher commissions, premium taxes and other expenses associated with growth in our business and higher salary and benefits costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation in 2004, and $20.0 million of contributions to our charitable foundation made by our Health Care segment in 2003 which did not recur in 2004. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 180 basis points to 17.0% in 2004, primarily due to our growth in operating revenue and the leveraging of costs over these higher revenues. Cost of drugs increased $56.3 million, or 145%, to $95.0 million in 2004, primarily due to higher mail-order prescription volume at our PBM. Interest expense increased $11.1 million, or 8%, to $142.3 million in 2004, primarily due to additional interest expense on the $2.8 billion of debt initially incurred in conjunction with the WHN merger. Debt of $2.8 billion initially incurred in conjunction with the WHN merger was reduced to approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2004. Interest expense for this merger-related debt was incurred in December 2004. Amortization of other intangible assets increased $13.8 million, or 29%, to $61.4 million in 2004, primarily due to additional amortization expense on identifiable intangible assets resulting from the WHN merger. Merger-related undertakings were expenses recorded in 2004 related to certain obligations under our agreements with the California Department of Insurance, the California Department of Managed Health Care and the Georgia Department of Insurance. These agreements were related to the merger with WHN. The loss on repurchase of debt incurred in 2004 related to our tender offer for our high coupon surplus notes. Due to the high coupon on this debt and time remaining until stated maturity, the debt was repurchased at a significant premium over book value, which was the driver of the loss. Income tax expense increased $45.6 million, or 10%, to $483.2 million in 2004. Included in 2004 was $44.8 million in tax benefits associated with a change in Indiana laws governing the state’s high-risk health insurance pool recorded during the first quarter of 2004. We use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, as described in FAS 131, Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. In connection with the WHN merger and related organizational changes, we evaluated FAS 131 criteria and determined our reportable segments to be Health Care, Specialty and Other. This represents a change from pre-merger Anthem, which disclosed each geographic health region as a reportable segment. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, selling, general and administrative expense and cost of drugs. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, merger related undertakings, loss on repurchase of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. For additional information, see Note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. The discussions of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 39 Health Care Our Health Care segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue $ 19,754.5 $ 16,000.1 $ 3,754.4 23% Operating gain $ 1,505.3 $ 1,174.6 $ 330.7 28% Operating margin 7.6% 7.3% 30 bp Operating revenue increased $3,754.4 million, or 23%, to $19,754.5 million in 2004, due to the impact of the merger with WHN, as the results of the acquired health business is included effective November 30, 2004. Operating revenue also increased due to premium rate increases in our Large Group, ISG, and Senior businesses. Also contributing to this growth were membership increases in our ISG and National Accounts businesses. Operating gain increased $330.7 million, or 28%, to $1,505.3 million, due to our merger with WHN, improved underwriting results in our Large Group business, and growth in our National Accounts businesses. Included in the 2003 results was a $31.7 million net favorable prior year reserve development recorded during the second quarter of 2003 and a $24.5 million favorable adjustment for resolution of a litigation matter in the first quarter of 2003. Also included in 2003 were premium refunds of $40.4 million issued to policyholders as claims costs in certain lines of business were much lower than expected. Additionally, our Health Care segment made contributions of $20.0 million to our charitable foundation in 2003 that did not occur in 2004. Specialty Our Specialty segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue $ 1,235.2 $ 732.0 $ 503.2 69% Operating gain $ 100.9 $ 69.1 $ 31.8 46% Operating margin 8.2% 9.4% (120) bp Operating revenue increased $503.2 million, or 69%, to $1,235.2 million in 2004, due to the impact of the merger with WHN, as the results of the acquired specialty business is included effective November 30, 2004. Operating revenue also increased due to increased mail-order prescription volume, including more specialty pharmacy prescriptions and increased wholesale drug costs which are passed through to customers of our PBM. Specialty pharmacy prescriptions include higher cost transactions for biopharmaceutical and injectable medications, which are complex in design and administration, and are costly to ship and store. The increased mail-order prescription volume resulted from both membership increases and additional utilization of our PBM’s mail-order pharmacy option. Effective January 1, 2004, our PBM began providing pharmacy benefit management services to our Virginia health members. Operating gain increased $31.8 million, or 46%, to $100.9 million in 2004, due to the impact of the merger with WHN, and increased mail-order prescription volume at our PBM. This improvement was partially offset by operating results in our other specialty businesses. 40 Other Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue from external customers $ 212.8 $ 197.8 $ 15.0 8% Elimination of intersegment revenues (741.6 ) (442.8 ) (298.8 ) 67% Total operating revenue (528.8 ) (245.0 ) (283.8 ) NM Operating loss $ (105.8 ) $ (147.3 ) $ 41.5 (28)% Operating revenue from external customers increased $15.0 million, or 8%, to $212.8 million in 2004, due to the impact of the merger with WHN, as well as an increase in revenues from our Medicare customer service software development contract with CMS. These were partially offset by the loss of our 1-800 Medicare Help Line contract with CMS, which was substantially completed by June 30, 2003. Elimination of intersegment revenues increased $298.8 million, or 67%, reflecting additional sales by our pharmacy benefit management company to our Health Care segment. Operating loss decreased $41.5 million, or 28%, to $(105.8) million in 2004, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses. VI. Membership—December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and geographical region as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. Also included below are key metrics from our Specialty segment, including prescription volume for our PBM and membership by product. The membership data presented is unaudited and in certain instances includes estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period, rounded to the nearest thousand.

Historical results have been reclassified to conform to current presentation. 2 Represents prescription volume for mail order and retail prescriptions. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, total medical membership increased approximately 874,000, or 8%, primarily in our BlueCard, National Accounts and ISG businesses. BlueCard membership increased 397,000, or 16%, primarily due to increased sales by other Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees to accounts with members who reside in or travel to our licensed areas. National Accounts membership increased 277,000, or 20%, due to increased sales in our existing markets due to recognition of the value of Blue Cross and Blue Shield networks and the related discounts we can secure, and our competitive advantage resulting from the breadth of our product offerings and distinctive customer service. Also contributing to our medical membership increase were ISG enrollment gains of 217,000, or 12%, primarily due to the introduction of new, more affordable product designs and an overall increase in consumer awareness of our wide variety of quality products and services. Self-funded medical membership increased 795,000, or 14%, primarily due to increases in BlueCard and National Accounts businesses. Fully-insured membership increased by 79,000 members, or 1%, primarily in our ISG businesses, as explained above. In addition, we experienced a change in our mix of business by funding arrangement as certain Large Group and National Accounts customers shifted from fully-insured to self-funded during the year ended December 31, 2003. Due to economic conditions, certain large accounts assumed the health care risk associated with insuring their employees. This shift in funding arrangements did not have a material impact on our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2003. Dental membership increased 1,041,000, or 70%, in 2003 primarily due to the integration of Connecticut health members, and growth from new sales. Vision membership increased 417,000 due to the new product launch, which took place in the fourth quarter of 2002. 42 VII. Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2002 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: Year Ended1 December 31 Change 2003 2002 $ % ($ in Millions, Except Per Share Data) Premiums $ 15,167.7 $ 11,937.9 $ 3,229.8 27 % Administrative fees 1,160.2 946.8 213.4 23 Other revenue 159.2 115.7 43.5 38 Total operating revenue 16,487.1 13,000.4 3,486.7 27 Net investment income 278.1 260.7 17.4 7 Net realized gains on investments 16.2 31.1 (14.9 ) (48 ) Total revenue 16,781.4 13,292.2 3,489.2 26 Benefit expense 12,254.5 9,821.9 2,432.6 25 Selling, general and administrative expense: Selling expense 411.2 308.0 103.2 34 General and administrative expense 2,686.3 2,207.1 479.2 22 Total selling, general and administrative expense 3,097.5 2,515.1 582.4 23 Cost of drugs 38.7 24.0 14.7 61 Interest expense 131.2 98.5 32.7 33 Amortization of other intangible assets 47.6 30.2 17.4 58 Total expense 15,569.5 12,489.7 3,079.8 25 Income before income taxes 1,211.9 802.5 409.4 51 Income taxes 437.6 253.4 184.2 73 Net income $ 774.3 $ 549.1 $ 225.2 41 % Average diluted shares outstanding (in millions) 142.0 121.8 20.2 17 % Diluted net income per share $ 5.45 $ 4.51 $ 0.94 21 % Benefit expense ratio2 80.8 % 82.3 % (150) bp 3 Selling, general and administrative expense ratio4 18.8 % 19.3 % (50) bp 3 Income before income taxes as a percentage of total revenue 7.2 % 6.0 % 120 bp 3 Net income as a percentage of total revenue 4.6 % 4.1 % 50 bp 3 Certain of the following definitions are also applicable to all other results of operations tables in this discussion: 1 Financial results for 2003 and 2002 represent the results of the former Anthem, Inc. only and have been reclassified to conform to current presentation. 2 Benefit expense ratio = Benefit expense ÷ Premiums. 3 bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%. 4 Selling, general and administrative expense ratio = Total selling, general and administrative expense ÷ Total operating revenue. Throughout the following discussion of our results of operations, the operating results related to the Trigon acquisition are included for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the five months ended December 31, 2002. Both periods exclude any operating results related to the WHN acquisition. Premiums increased $3,229.8 million, or 27%, to $15,167.7 million in 2003, primarily due to the impact of the Trigon acquisition, and also due to premium rate increases in our Large Group and ISG businesses. Also 43 contributing to premium growth was higher fully-insured membership, primarily in our ISG business, which was partially offset by changes in the mix of our fully-insured products with members selecting less rich benefit designs, resulting in lower priced products. Also offsetting the growth were shifts by certain Large Group and National Account customers to self-funding arrangements, resulting in a shift from premiums to administrative fees and lower total revenues. The claims costs in certain Health Care segment lines of business were much lower than anticipated in 2003. Therefore, we issued premiums refunds to certain policyholders in the aggregate amount of $40.4 million, offsetting our premium growth. Our premium yields, net of buy-downs, for our fully-insured Large Group and Small Group businesses were approximately 10% on a rolling 12-month basis as of December 31, 2003. Administrative fees increased $213.4 million, or 23%, to $1,160.2 million in 2003 due to the impact of the Trigon acquisition, and also due to increased BlueCard activity and increased revenues from self-funded membership, some of which resulted from the shift of customers from fully-insured arrangements. These increases were partially offset by decreased administrative fees from AdminaStar Federal’s 1-800 Medicare Help Line contract with CMS. During the fourth quarter of 2002, CMS awarded a new contract for this service to a competitor. The transition of this contract was substantially completed by June 30, 2003. Administrative fee increases were also partially offset by the termination of a Health Care segment third party administrator arrangement in 2002. Other revenue is comprised principally of co-payments and deductibles associated with the sale of mail-order drugs by our PBM, which provides its services principally to members of our Health Care segment. Other revenue increased $43.5 million, or 38%, to $159.2 million in 2003, primarily due to additional mail-order prescription volume and increased prices of prescription drugs sold by our PBM. Increased mail-order prescription volume resulted from both membership increases and additional utilization of our PBM’s mail-order pharmacy. Benefit expense increased $2,432.6 million, or 25%, to $12,254.5 million in 2003. Included in these 2003 results was a $31.7 million net favorable prior year reserve development recorded during the second quarter of 2003, and a $24.5 million favorable adjustment for resolution of a litigation matter in the first quarter of 2003 in our Health Care segment. Included in the 2002 results was a $26.6 million net favorable prior year reserve development. Benefit expense increased primarily due to increased cost of care, which was driven primarily by higher costs in professional services and outpatient services. Our benefit expense ratio decreased 150 basis points from 82.3% in 2002 to 80.8% in 2003 due in part to the impact of our Trigon acquisition in 2002, and also due to lower than anticipated medical costs, the favorable resolution of litigation, disciplined pricing and mix of business shifts from fully-insured to self-funded arrangements by groups that have had historically higher loss ratios. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $582.4 million, or 23%, to $3,097.5 million in 2003 due to the impact of the Trigon acquisition, and also due to increases in volume-sensitive costs such as higher commissions, premium taxes and other expenses associated with growth in our business. Additionally, expenses increased due to higher salary and benefits costs resulting from normal merit and benefit increases. Included in the 2003 results were $20.0 million of contributions to our charitable foundation made by our Health Care segment. Included in the 2002 results was an unfavorable $23.0 million adjustment recorded to reflect the accrual of additional premium taxes in the state of Ohio and a $10.1 million reduction in the carrying value of our investment in MedUnite. Before the impact of our Trigon acquisition, our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 70 basis points to 18.8% in 2003, primarily due to our growth in operating revenue and the leveraging of costs over these higher revenues. Cost of drugs increased $14.7 million, or 61%, to $38.7 million in 2003, primarily due to higher prescription volume at our PBM. Net investment income increased $17.4 million, or 7%, to $278.1 million in 2003. This increase in investment income primarily resulted from the investment of additional assets in 2003 from our Trigon 44 acquisition and reinvestment of cash generated from operations, which were partially offset by a decrease in yields from new investments. A summary of our net realized gains on investments for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 is as follows: Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 $ Change ($ in Millions) Net realized gains from the sale of fixed-maturity securities $ 41.7 $ 32.9 $ 8.8 Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities 0.5 0.6 (0.1 ) Other-than-temporary impairments (24.4 ) (3.1 ) 21.3 ) Other gains (losses) (1.6 ) 0.7 (2.3 ) Net realized gains on investments $ 16.2 $ 31.1 $ (14.9 ) Other-than-temporary impairments recognized in 2003 were substantially related to our equity investments, primarily due to the length of time that the securities’ fair value had been less than cost. In 2002, we recorded a $3.1 million other-than-temporary impairment on a limited partnership. Interest expense increased $32.7 million, or 33%, to $131.2 million in 2003, primarily resulting from additional interest expense incurred on the debt issued in conjunction with our Trigon acquisition. Interest expense on this debt was included for twelve months in 2003 and five months in 2002. Amortization of other intangible assets increased $17.4 million, or 58%, to $47.6 million in 2003, primarily due to additional amortization expense on identifiable intangible assets resulting from our Trigon acquisition. This amortization expense was included for twelve months in 2003 and five months in 2002. Income tax expense increased $184.2 million, or 73%, to $437.6 million in 2003, primarily due to increased income before taxes. In addition, our effective income tax rate increased to 36.1% in 2003 from 31.6% in 2002. This 450 basis point increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the release of a deferred tax valuation allowance in 2002. Health Care Our Health Care segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue $ 16,000.1 $ 12,587.2 $ 3,412.9 27 % Operating gain $ 1,174.6 $ 684.0 $ 490.6 72 % Operating margin 7.3 % 5.4 % 190 bp In the table above, the year ended December 31, 2003 includes twelve months of operating results related to the Trigon acquisition, and the year ended December 31, 2002 includes five months of operating results related to the Trigon acquisition. Operating revenue increased $3,412.9 million, or 27%, to $16,000.1 million in 2003 due to the impact of the Trigon acquisition, and also due to premium rate increases in our Large Group and ISG businesses. Also contributing to operating revenue growth was higher fully-insured membership, primarily in our ISG business. Operating revenue increases were partially offset by changes in the mix of our products with members selecting 45 less rich benefit designs, resulting in lower priced products. Also offsetting the growth were shifts by certain National Accounts and Large Group customers to self-funded arrangements, resulting in lower revenues. Operating gain increased $490.6 million, or 72%, to $1,174.6 million in 2003. Included in these 2003 results was a $31.7 million net favorable prior year reserve development recorded during the second quarter of 2003, a $24.5 million favorable adjustment for resolution of a litigation matter in the first quarter of 2003, and premium refunds of $40.4 million issued to policyholders, as claims costs in certain lines of business were much lower than expected. Also included in the 2003 results were $20.0 million of contributions to our charitable foundation. Included in the 2002 results was an unfavorable $23.0 million adjustment recorded to reflect the accrual of additional premium taxes in the state of Ohio and a $26.6 million net favorable prior year reserve development. Specialty Our Specialty segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue $ 732.0 $ 523.5 $ 208.5 40 % Operating gain $ 69.1 $ 50.7 $ 18.4 36 % Operating margin 9.4 % 9.7 % (30) bp Operating revenue increased $208.5 million, or 40%, to $732.0 million in 2003, primarily due to increased mail-order prescription volume and increased wholesale drug costs which are passed through to our customers at our PBM, as well as the results of our behavioral health company, which evolved from our acquisition of PRO Behavioral Health on June 1, 2002. The increased mail-order prescription volume resulted from membership increases and additional utilization of our PBM’s mail-order pharmacy option. Operating revenue from our behavioral health business is increasing as we begin to provide these services to more of our existing health membership. Operating gain increased $18.4 million, or 36%, to $69.1 million in 2003, primarily due to increased mail-order prescription volume. Improved behavioral health results due to additional revenues from existing health members who were converted to our internal behavioral health company during 2003 also contributed to Specialty’s increased operating gains. These improvements in operating gain were partially offset by start-up and integration expenses associated with our dental and vision operations. Other Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 $ Change % Change ($ in Millions) Operating revenue from external customers $ 197.8 $ 189.3 $ 8.5 4 % Elimination of intersegment revenues (442.8 ) (299.6 ) (143.2 ) 48 % Total operating revenue (245.0 ) (110.3 ) (134.7 ) NM Operating loss $ (147.3 ) $ (95.3 ) $ (52.0 ) 55 % Operating revenue from external customers increased $8.5 million, or 4%, to $197.8 million in 2003, primarily due to cost reimbursement activity being reflected in our Medicare administration operations. This 46 increase was partially offset by the loss of AdminaStar Federal’s 1-800 Medicare Help Line contract with CMS. During the fourth quarter of 2002, CMS awarded a new contract for this service to a competitor. The transition of the contract was substantially completed by June 30, 2003. Elimination of intersegment revenues increased $143.2 million, or 48%, reflecting additional sales by our pharmacy benefit management company to our Health Care segment. Operating loss increased $52.0 million, or 55%, to $(147.3) million in 2003, primarily due to additional technology expenses, incentive compensation not allocated to the operating segments associated with better than expected performance and legal fees and expenses paid in 2003. VIII. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this Management’s Discussion and Analysis. We consider some of our most important accounting policies that require estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medial claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 included in this Form 10-K. Medical Claims Payable The most judgmental accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2004, this liability was $4,202.0 million and represented 21% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for pending claims and claims that are incurred but not reported, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Pending claims are those received by us but not yet processed through our systems. Liabilities for both incurred but not reported and reported but not yet paid claims are determined employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not reported claims by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical data of paid claims is formatted into claim triangles which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. Actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months, the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or “trend factors”. Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns and claim submission patterns. A comparison of prior period 47 liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In the actuarial process, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated, but rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense. In addition to the pending claims and incurred but not reported claims, the liability for medical claims payable includes reserves for premium deficiencies, if appropriate. Premium deficiencies are recognized when it is probable that expected claims and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums on existing medical insurance contracts without consideration of investment income. Determination of premium deficiencies for longer duration life and disability contracts includes consideration of investment income. For purposes of premium deficiencies, contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. Management regularly reviews its assumptions regarding our claims liabilities and makes adjustments to benefit expense when necessary. If it is determined that management’s assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claims liabilities occur each quarter and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that quarter. Prior year development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior year liability is no longer needed or that additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is accurate and will not fluctuate significantly with future development. As described above, the completion factors and trend factors can have a significant impact on the claim liability. The following example provides the estimated impact to our December 31, 2004 unpaid claims liability assuming hypothetical changes in the completion and trend factors: Completion Factor 1 Claims Trend Factor2 (Decrease) Increase in Completion Factor Increase (Decrease) in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease) Increase in Claim Trend Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities ($ in Millions) ($ in Millions) (3)% $606.0 (3)% $(154.0) (2)% 395.0 (2)% (103.0) (1)% 193.0 (1)% (51.0) 1 % (185.0) 1 % 51.0 2 % (363.0) 2 % 103.0 3 % (533.0) 3 % 154.0 1 Assumes (decrease) increase in the completion factors for the most recent four months 2 Assumes (decrease) increase in the claims trend factors for the most recent two months In addition, assuming a hypothetical 1% total difference between our December 31, 2004 estimated claims liability and the actual claims paid, net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 would increase or decrease by $27.3 million while basic net income per share would increase or decrease by $0.18 per share and diluted net income per share would increase or decrease by $0.17 per share. As summarized below, Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 included in this Form 10-K provides historical information regarding the accrual and payment of our medical claims liability. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 48 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements, the line labeled “incurred related to prior years” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “incurred related to prior years” claims may be offset as we establish the estimate of “incurred related to current year”. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. Thus, only when the release of a prior year reserve is not offset with the same level of conservatism in estimating the current year reserve will the redundancy create a net reduction in current benefit expense. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business. We believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for unpaid claims liability at each reporting date. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (In Millions) Balances at January 1, net of reinsurance $ 1,833.0 $ 1,797.2 $ 1,318.6 Business combinations and purchase adjustments 2,394.4 (20.6 ) 379.4 Incurred related to: Current year 15,452.6 12,374.2 9,887.9 Prior years (redundancy) (172.4 ) (226.2 ) (147.0 ) Total incurred 15,280.2 12,148.0 9,740.9 Paid related to: Current year 12,556.3 10,598.3 8,316.6 Prior years 2,781.2 1,493.3 1,325.1 Total paid 15,337.5 12,091.6 9,641.7 Balances at December 31, net of reinsurance 4,170.1 1,833.0 1,797.2 Reinsurance recoverables at December 31 31.9 8.7 2.8 Balances at December 31, gross of reinsurance recoverables $ 4,202.0 $ 1,841.7 $ 1,800.0 Current year paid as a percent of current year incurred 81.3% 85.6% 84.1% Prior year incurred redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year incurred claims 1.4% 2.3% 1.9% Amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled. Liabilities at any year end are continually reviewed and re-estimated as information regarding actual claims payments, or runout, becomes known. This information is compared to the originally established year end liability. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated. The redundancy of $172.4 million shown in the table above and in Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, represents an estimate based on paid claim activity from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2004. Medical claim liabilities are usually described as having a “short tail”, which means that they are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the majority, or approximately 81%, of the $172.4 million redundancy relates to claims incurred in calendar year 2003, with the remaining 19% related to claims incurred in 2002 and prior. We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current period to total incurred claims recorded in each prior year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. This metric was 1.4% for 2004, 2.3% for 2003 and 1.9% for 2002. The 2.3% ratio for 2003 was impacted by having only five months of incurred claims in 2002 related to the former Trigon Healthcare, Inc. If the former Trigon Healthcare, Inc. had been included for the full year 2002, the ratio would have been approximately 2.0% for 2003. For the 49 year ended December 31, 2004, the metric was 1.4%. This ratio is calculated using the redundancy of $172.4 million, shown above, which represents an estimate based on paid claim activity from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2004. The ratio of current year paid as a percent of current year incurred was 81.3% for 2004, 85.6% for 2003, and 84.1% for 2002. The 2004 ratio was impacted by having only one month of incurred and paid claims during 2004 for the former WHN. If the former WHN had not been included during 2004, the adjusted ratio would have been approximately 87.3% for 2004. The adjusted 2004 ratio compared to the 2003 ratio indicates that we are paying claims faster. The increase is primarily attributable to improved processes and electronic connectivity with our provider networks. The result of these changes is an enhanced ability to adjudicate and pay claims more quickly. To illustrate this point, using the adjusted 2004 ratio, 87.3% of current year incurred claims were paid in the same period as incurred, as compared to 85.6% for the same period in 2003. Hence, the payment patterns in 2004 resulted in acceleration of approximately $236.0 million, as compared to 2003 payment patterns. The following table shows the variance between total incurred as reported in the above table for each of 2003 and 2002 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “Incurred related to current year” for the year shown and “Incurred related to prior years” for the immediately following year): 2003 2002 (In Millions) Total incurred as reported $ 12,148.0 $ 9,740.9 Retrospective basis 12,201.8 9,661.7 Variance $ (53.8 ) $ 79.2 Variance to total incurred (0.4 )% 0.8 % Management expects that substantially all of the development of the 2004 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2005. This table shows that the Company’s estimates of this liability have approximated the actual development. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This standard requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance. At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following: • the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset; • the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim; • the forecasted future taxable income and therefore likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and • any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the valuation allowance decreased by $33.8 million, $81.9 million and $112.4 million, respectively. The 2004 and 2003 reductions resulted from utilizing alternative minimum tax, or AMT, 50 credits and net operating losses on our federal income tax return for which we had a deferred tax asset with a corresponding valuation allowance. As deferred tax assets related to those deductions are available for use in the tax return, a valuation was no longer required and was reduced. The decrease in the valuation allowance in 2004 was partially offset by an additional $5.6 million related to Indiana state taxes, as discussed below. During 2002 it was determined that the only items requiring a valuation allowance were those that relate to the anticipation of future taxable income. This determination was due to the levels of taxable income reported in our 2001 tax return, income generated during 2002 and taxable income expected in future periods. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, we recorded additional tax liabilities of $44.1 million, $81.9 million and $57.2 million, respectively. These amounts offset the reduction in valuation allowances discussed above. These additional liabilities were recorded for uncertainty on several tax issues, including uncertainty arising from the lack of clear guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, on various tax issues relating to our conversion from tax exempt to tax paying status. During 2002, the remainder of the decrease in the valuation allowance was offset by a reduction of goodwill of $18.0 million and also a reduction in tax expense of $37.2 million, which contributed to a reduced effective tax rate of 31.6% for the year ended December 31, 2002. As a result of legislation enacted in Indiana on March 16, 2004, we recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities, with a corresponding net tax benefit in our income statement of $44.8 million, or $0.29 per basic share and $0.28 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2004. The legislation eliminated the creation of tax credits resulting from the payment of future assessments to the Indiana Comprehensive Health Insurance Association, or ICHIA. ICHIA is Indiana’s high-risk health insurance pool. Our historical ICHIA assessment payments far exceeded our Indiana income tax liability. Thus, the recognition of a state deferred tax asset was not warranted, as a future Indiana tax liability was unlikely. Under the new legislation, ICHIA tax credits are limited to any unused ICHIA assessment paid prior to December 31, 2004. FAS 109 requires that deferred assets or liabilities be established in the period a change in law is enacted. These deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits relating to our Indiana income tax filings. Following guidance in FAS 109, a valuation allowance of $5.6 million was established for the portion of the deferred tax asset, which we believe will likely not be utilized. There is no carryforward limitation on the tax credits and the net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2018. We believe we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to offset these carryforwards; therefore, no additional valuation allowance was recorded. We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional tax liability for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for exposures. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted. In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and state authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. The IRS completed its examination of our 1999 and 2000 federal tax returns in the fourth quarter of 2004. We negotiated the settlement of a number of proposed audit adjustments to which we agree that resulted in an additional $3.7 million of income tax for the 1999 and 2000 years, which was paid in the fourth quarter of 2004. We plan to pursue an administrative appeal before the IRS relating to examination findings with which we do not agree. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intend to defend our positions vigorously through the IRS appeals process. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact to earnings from these matters. The IRS began an examination of our 2001 and 2002 tax returns in November 2004. 51 For additional information, see Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 included in this Form 10-K. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2004 was $10,017.9 million and other intangible assets were $8,211.6 million. The sum of goodwill and intangible assets represents 46% of our total consolidated assets and 94% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2004. We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and Statement of Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FAS 141 specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under FAS 142, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. We completed our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) for each of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 and based upon these tests we have not incurred any impairment losses related to any goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives). On November 30, 2004, we completed our merger with WHN and purchased 100% of the outstanding common stock of WHN. In accordance with FAS 141, we allocated the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed. This allocation process included the review of relevant information about the assets and liabilities, independent appraisals and other valuations to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary allocation resulted in $7,579.6 million of non-tax deductible goodwill and $7,046.0 million of identifiable intangible assets. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and additional refinements may occur, including the completion of final third-party valuations of certain intangible assets. On July 31, 2002, we completed our purchase of 100% of the outstanding stock of Trigon Healthcare, Inc. In accordance with FAS 141, we allocated the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed. This allocation process included the review of relevant information about the assets and liabilities, independent appraisals and other valuations to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation resulted in $2,146.1 million of non-tax deductible goodwill and $1,172.7 million of identifiable intangible assets. While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, the annual impairment testing required under FAS 142 requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our goodwill and intangibles. Such assumptions include the discount factor used to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, which is ultimately used to identify potential goodwill impairment. Such estimated fair values might produce significantly different results if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. Because of the amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet, the impairment analysis is significant. If we are unable to support a fair value estimate in future annual goodwill impairment tests or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income. For additional information, see Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 included in this Form 10-K. Investments Investment securities were $13,586.9 million at December 31, 2004 and represented 34% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2004. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, our fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as “available-for-sale” securities and are reported at fair value. We have determined that all investments in our portfolio, with the exception of certain securities held for contractual or regulatory purposes, are available to support current operations, and accordingly, have classified such securities as current assets. Investment income is recorded when earned, and realized gains or losses, determined by specific identification of investments sold, are included in income when the securities are sold. In addition to current available-for-sale investment securities, we held long-term investments of $748.1 million, or 2% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2004. These long-term investments consist primarily of restricted assets, certain equity securities and other investments, including investments on deposit with regulatory agencies. Due to their restricted nature, these investments are classified as long-term without regard to contractual maturity dates. An impairment review of securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We evaluate our investment securities on a quarterly basis, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. If any declines are determined to be other than temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made. The current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment. The same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. We recorded charges for other-than-temporary impairment of securities of $0.8 million, $24.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded a $22.3 million charge for other-than-temporary impairment of our equity securities, primarily due to the length of time that the securities’ fair value had been less than cost. Management believes it has adequately reviewed for impairment and that its investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change management’s judgment regarding impairment. This could result in realized losses relating to other-than-temporary declines being charged against future income. A summary of current available-for-sale investments with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2004 along with the related fair value, aggregated by the length of time that investments have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, is as follows: Less than Twelve Months Twelve Months or More Total Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses (In Millions) Fixed maturity securities: United States Government securities $ 809.2 $ 2.4 $ — $ — $ 809.2 $ 2.4 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 902.2 10.6 56.3 1.1 958.5 11.7 Corporate securities 1,363.1 8.4 26.5 0.7 1,389.6 9.1 Mortgage-backed securities 750.2 3.6 53.4 1.0 803.6 4.6 Total fixed maturity securities 3,824.7 25.0 136.2 2.8 3,960.9 27.8 Equity securities 82.5 3.3 — — 82.5 3.3 Total $ 3,907.2 $ 28.3 $ 136.2 $ 2.8 $ 4,043.4 $ 31.1 53 The Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, which impact the fair value of individual securities. Unrealized losses reported above were primarily caused by the effect of a rising interest rate environment on certain securities with stated interest rates currently below market rates. The Company currently has the ability and intent to hold these securities until their full cost can be recovered. Therefore, the Company does not believe the unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment as of December 31, 2004. The Company participates in securities lending programs whereby marketable securities in its investment portfolio are transferred to independent brokers or dealers based on, among other things, their creditworthiness in exchange for collateral initially equal to at least 102% of the value of the securities on loan and is thereafter maintained at a minimum of 100% of the market value of the securities loaned. The market value of the securities on loan to each borrower is monitored daily and the borrower is required to deliver additional collateral if the market value of the collateral falls below 100% of the market value of the securities on loan. Under the guidance provided in FAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, the Company recognizes the collateral as an asset under “securities lending collateral” on its balance sheet and the Company records a corresponding liability for the obligation to return the collateral to the borrower under “securities lending payable”. Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage the market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits of investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future earnings and financial position. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $476.7 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $466.7 million increase in fair value. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $117.3 million. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $117.3 million. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 included in this Form 10-K. Retirement Benefits Pension Benefits We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our employees, including plans sponsored by WHN prior to the merger. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FAS 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by FAS 87, we calculate the value of plan assets (described below). Further, the effects on our computation of pension expense from the performance of the pension plans’ assets and changes in pension liabilities are amortized over future periods. We use a September 30 measurement date for determining benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets. Plans sponsored by pre-merger WHN, which have historically used a December 31 measurement date, will begin using a September 30 measurement date in 2005. The effective rates discussed below are based on a weighted average of all the plans and include the effect of using two measurement dates. An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our last measurement date, we selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 8.00% (consistent with 8.00% for 2004 expense recognition). We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development 54 of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. The expected long-term rate of return is calculated by the geometric averaging method, which calculates an expected multi-period return, reflecting volatility drag on compound returns. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase. This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years. This produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our measurement dates. The weighted average discount rate for all plans is 5.83%, which was developed using a benchmark rate of the Moody’s Aa Corporate Bonds index. Changes in the discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension expense, and the net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FAS 87. In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities and equity securities across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in the Company’s expense and cash flow. Over time, the Company has increased the duration and allocation of fixed maturity securities to more closely match the sensitivity of plan assets with the plan obligations. As of our measurement dates, we had approximately 58% of plan assets invested in equity securities, 40% in fixed maturity securities and 2% in other assets. Approximately $10.0 million, or less than 1%, of plan assets were invested in WellPoint common stock as of December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, our consolidated net prepaid pension asset was $198.7 million, a decrease from $258.3 million at December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to lower funding amounts and the addition of underfunded accrued pension benefit liabilities acquired from WHN during 2004 as compared to 2003. We funded our cash balance pension plans in the amount of $10.0 million during 2004 and $115.0 million during 2003. For the year ending December 31, 2005, the Company does not expect any required contributions under ERISA. The Company may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we recognized consolidated pretax pension expense of $40.8 million, $21.3 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Other Postretirement Benefits We provide most employees certain life, medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions including a discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits. We recognized a postretirement benefit liability of $381.0 million at December 31, 2004. 55 At our last measurement dates, the weighted average discount rate was 5.87%, developed using a benchmark rate of the Moody’s Aa Corporate Bonds index. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of other benefits is 9.00% for 2005 with a gradual decline to 5.15% by the year 2009. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The health care cost trend assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2004 by $36.0 million and would increase service and interest costs by $3.0 million. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by $30.0 million as of December 31, 2004 and would decrease service and interest costs by $2.5 million. See “New Accounting Pronouncements” below for discussion of Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. For additional information regarding retirement benefits, see Note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 included in this Form 10-K. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (“FAS 123R”). FAS 123R eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic method of accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (“APB 25”), and requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. FAS 123R will be effective for us on July 1, 2005. The impact of adoption on our financial position or results of operations has not yet been determined. See Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for our current disclosures of pro forma stock compensation expense. In November 2003, the FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”), as part of its discussion surrounding EITF Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of Other-than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments (“EITF 03-1”), reached a consensus to require certain year end quantitative and qualitative disclosures about the unrealized losses from debt and equity securities, and management’s conclusion that any impairment is temporary. The required disclosures are required to include quantitative information about (1) the aggregate amount of unrealized losses and (2) the aggregate related fair values of investments with unrealized losses, summarized by the time period during which the investment has been in an unrealized loss position. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments” above and Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for these required disclosures. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 03-1-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments (“FSP 03-1-1”), which delayed the effective date for the recognition and measurement guidance of EITF 03-1, as contained in paragraphs 10-20, until certain implementation issues are addressed. The disclosure requirements of the consensus, as described in the preceding paragraph, remain in effect. FSP 03-1-1 requires entities to continue applying relevant “other-than-temporary” guidance to determine if an impairment exists. As described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments” above, we believe we have adequately reviewed for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 became law in December 2003 and expanded Medicare, primarily adding a prescription drug benefit for Medicare-eligible retirees starting 56 in 2006. We anticipate that the benefits we pay in 2006 and beyond will be lower as a result of the new Medicare provisions. FASB Staff Position 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (“FSP 106-2”), was issued in May 2004. FSP 106-2, which supersedes FSP 106-1, provides accounting guidance for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits where the company has concluded that prescription drug benefits to “some or all participants for some or all future years are actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D” and will receive the subsidy available under the Act. The FSP also provides disclosure requirements about the effects of the subsidy for companies that offer prescription drug benefits but have not yet determined whether they are actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. We have determined that our prescription drug benefits are actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. As such, we accounted for the impact of FSP 106-2 as required in the quarter ended September 30, 2004, using the prospective method. The impact of adopting FSP 106-2, while accretive to earnings, was not material to our consolidated financial statements. There were no other new accounting pronouncements issued during 2004 that had a material impact on our financial position, operating results or disclosures. IX. Liquidity and Capital Resources Introduction Our cash receipts consist primarily of premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchase of investment securities, interest expense, payments on long- term borrowings, capital expenditures and repurchase of our common stock. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. As such, any future decline in our profitability would likely have some negative impact on our liquidity. We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy. A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities, to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are available for sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Excess capital is paid annually in the form of dividends by subsidiaries to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. We have access to a $2.0 billion commercial paper program supported by $2.5 billion of revolving credit facilities, which allow us to maintain further operating and financial flexibility. Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 During 2004, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,303.2 million, as compared to $1,159.0 million in 2003, an increase of $144.2 million. The increase resulted from improved net income, including the impact of our merger with WHN, partially offset by a decline in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Our decline in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities included the impact of long-term compensation payments of approximately $113.0 million made during 2004 that had been accrued in prior years. 57 Net cash provided by operating activities for 2004 included one month of WHN cash flow activity following the merger. WHN reported net cash provided by operating activities of $972.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. Net cash used in investing activities was $2,373.9 million in 2004, compared to cash used of $1,129.2 million in 2003, an increase in cash used of $1,244.7 million. The table below outlines the changes in investing cash flow between the two years (in millions): Increase in net purchases of subsidiaries $ 2,233.3 Decrease in net purchases of investments (999.3 ) Increase in net purchases of property and equipment 26.4 Proceeds from settlement of cash flow hedges (15.7 ) Total increase in cash used in investing activities $ 1,244.7 The purchase of investment securities in 2004 decreased from 2003 as operating cash was retained for the WHN merger. The increase in 2004 subsidiary purchases resulted primarily from the use of cash for the WHN merger, as compared to minimal activity in 2003. The increase in net property and equipment purchases included one month of cash outflows for the pre-merger WHN companies. Net cash provided by financing activities was $2,063.4 million in 2004 compared to cash used in financing activities of $260.2 million in 2003. Financing activity related to the merger with WHN, as described below, contributed to the increase in cash provided by financing activities. Effective with the WHN merger, the board of directors authorized an increase in our commercial paper program from $1,000.0 million to $2,000.0 million. In December 2004, we initially borrowed $1,500.0 million under this commercial paper program, which was used to repay a portion of our senior credit facilities which were used at the date of the WHN merger to complete the transaction. As of December 31, 2004, $793.2 million of commercial paper remained outstanding. On December 9, 2004, we issued $300.0 million of 3.750% Notes due 2007, $300.0 million of 4.250% Notes due 2009, $500.0 million of 5.000% Notes due 2014 and $500.0 million of 5.950% Notes due 2034. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $1,583.7 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses. Proceeds from these notes were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our bridge loan and five year credit facility, which were used at the date of the WHN merger to complete the transaction. In addition, a portion of the proceeds were used to fund the tender offer to purchase subsidiary surplus notes. The remainder of the proceeds was used to repay amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program described above. During 2004, we received $159.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program. These proceeds were offset by $82.2 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock. During 2003, $217.2 million was used to repurchase our common stock. In addition, $100.0 million was used to fund the payment of senior guaranteed notes, which matured on July 15, 2003. These payments were offset by $57.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program. Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 During 2003, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,159.0 million, as compared to $994.1 million in 2002, an increase of $164.9 million. The increase resulted from improved net income, including the 58 impact of our July 31, 2002 acquisition of Trigon Healthcare, Inc. (“Trigon”), offset by a decline in operating cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities. The decline in cash from operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from increases in receivables resulting from growth in our revenue base, payment for resolution of a litigation matter and higher incentive payments during 2003 as compared to 2002. Net cash flow used in investing activities was $1,129.2 million in 2003, compared to cash used of $1,414.9 million in 2002, a decrease in cash used of $285.7 million. The table below outlines the changes in investing cash flow between the two years (in millions): Decrease in net purchases of subsidiaries $ (782.1 ) Increase in net purchases of investments 504.7 Decrease in net purchases of property and equipment (8.3 ) Total decrease in cash used in investing activities $ (285.7 ) The purchase of investment securities increased as operating cash was invested and cash balances held by our investment managers was reduced. The decrease in subsidiary purchases resulted primarily from minimal activity in 2003 versus 2002, which included our Trigon acquisition. The decrease in net property and equipment purchases was nominal. Net cash flow used in financing activities was $260.2 million in 2003 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $709.3 million in 2002. During 2003, $217.2 million was used to repurchase our common stock. In addition, $100.0 million was used to fund the payment of senior guaranteed notes, which matured on July 15, 2003. These payments were offset by $57.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program. During 2002, proceeds of $938.5 million were received from the issuance of senior notes used to fund a portion of the Trigon acquisition. In addition, $31.1 million was received from the issuance of common stock due to the exercise of stock options and from our employee stock program. Offsetting these amounts was $256.2 million used to repurchase shares of common stock and $4.1 million used for costs related to the issuance of shares for the Trigon acquisition. Financial Condition We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, of $15.8 billion at December 31, 2004. Since December 31, 2003, total cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, increased by $8.3 billion, primarily resulting from our merger with WHN. Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Also, in connection with the WHN merger, the Company and certain of our subsidiaries in California and Georgia executed undertakings with the California Department of Managed Health Care, the California Department of Insurance and the Georgia Department of Insurance which contained various commitments, including the commitment to provide $61.5 million of support for health benefit programs in those states. Additional undertakings include the requirement to maintain certain capital levels at those subsidiaries. During 2004, we received $1,097.7 million of dividends from our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2004, we held at the parent company approximately $207.3 million of our consolidated $15.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments, which is available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, share and debt repurchases and interest payments. Our consolidated debt-to-total capital ratio (calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt plus shareholders’ equity) was 18.5% as of December 31, 2004 and 21.7% as of December 31, 2003. 59 Our senior debt is rated “BBB+” by Standard & Poor’s, “A-” by Fitch, Inc., “Baa1” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “a-” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. A significant downgrade in our debt ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs. Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity On November 19, 2004, we entered into new senior revolving credit facilities with certain of our lenders. The new facilities include a $1,000.0 million facility which expires on November 29, 2005 and a $1,500.0 million facility which will mature on November 30, 2009. These facilities replaced our $600.0 million revolving credit facility which was set to mature on June 28, 2005 and the $400.0 million revolving facility, which would have matured on November 5, 2006. Our ability to borrow under these new facilities is subject to compliance with certain covenants. As of December 31, 2004, there were no amounts outstanding under these facilities and we were in compliance with all covenants. These revolving credit facilities support our commercial paper program described in the next paragraph. Any borrowings under the commercial paper program will reduce the availability under the revolving credit facilities. Effective upon the merger with WHN, the board of directors authorized an increase in our commercial paper program from $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion. Proceeds from any issuance of commercial paper may be used for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of our debt and common stock. Commercial paper notes are short-term senior unsecured notes, with a maturity not to exceed 270 days from date of issuance. When issued, the notes bear interest at current market rates. There were $793.2 million of borrowings outstanding under this commercial paper program as of December 31, 2004. On December 18, 2002, we filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings up to an aggregate amount of $1.0 billion. Specific information regarding terms of the offering and the securities being offered will be provided at the time of the offering. Proceeds from any offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt, capitalization of our subsidiaries or the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion. During August 2004, $200.0 million of 3.500% Notes due 2007 were issued under the shelf registration. As of December 31, 2004, Anthem had $800.0 million of the shelf registration capacity remaining. As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we are currently estimating approximately $1.2 billion of dividends to be paid to the parent company during 2005. During December 2004, we completed a tender offer to purchase subsidiary surplus notes from the holders, and purchased $258.0 million of 9.125% notes due 2010 and $174.9 million of 9.000% notes due 2027. Future interest payments on these portions of the notes will be paid by the subsidiary to the parent company, and are expected to be approximately $39.2 million annually. In 2003, the board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to $500.0 million of stock under a program that would have expired in February 2005. Under this program, repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. We purchased 1.0 million shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2004, at a cost of $82.3 million. We purchased nearly 3.4 million shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2003, at a cost of $217.2 million. On October 25, 2004, the board of directors authorized an increase of $500.0 million to the program and extended the expiration date until February 2006. As of December 31, 2004, we had $700.5 million of authorization remaining under this program. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we funded a $10.0 million tax deductible discretionary contribution to our cash balance pension plan. Our current funding strategy is to fund an amount at least equal to 60 the minimum required funding as determined under ERISA with consideration of factors such as the minimum pension liability requirement and maximum tax deductible amounts. We may elect to make discretionary contributions, including on a quarterly basis, up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2004 are as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations and Commitments (In Millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Long term debt and capital leases $ 4,276.7 $ — $ 961.2 $ 1,091.9 $ 2,223.6 Capital leases 32.1 13.7 14.5 3.9 — Operating leases 871.7 135.1 193.0 141.8 401.8 Venture capital commitments 26.6 10.5 12.6 2.9 0.6 Purchase obligations1 129.0 75.9 47.2 5.9 — Other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet 4,432.1 — 786.2 816.3 2,829.6 Total contractual obligations and commitments $ 9,768.2 $ 235.2 $ 2,014.7 $ 2,062.7 $ 5,455.6 1Includes obligations related to IT service agreements and telecommunication contracts In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material non-cancelable commitments. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our credit agreements or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions. For additional information on our debt and lease commitments, see Notes 6 and 16, respectively, to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 included in this Form 10-K. Risk-Based Capital Our regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies largely based on the NAIC’s RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under this Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our risk-based capital as of December 31, 2004, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, was in excess of all mandatory RBC thresholds. In addition to exceeding the RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of the Company’s California subsidiaries.

As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on WellPoint’s financial positions as of December 31, 2004. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return. Investments Our investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk. The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit downgrade to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that downgrade. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately AA. Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities, due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and 62 municipal bonds, all of which represent an exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value. Our portfolio includes corporate securities (approximately 44% of the total fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2004) which are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. This risk is managed through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately AA. Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systematic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio. All of our current investments are classified as available-for-sale. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 91% of our current investments were fixed maturity securities. Market risk is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $476.7 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $466.7 million increase in fair value. While we classify our current fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly. Our equity securities portfolio, as of December 31, 2004, was approximately 9% of our current investments. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $117.3 million. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $117.3 million. Debt Our total debt at December 31, 2004 was $4.4 billion, and included $793.2 million of commercial paper. The carrying value of the commercial paper approximates fair value as the underlying instruments have variable interest rates at market value. The remainder of the debt is subject to interest rate risk as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2004, we had $150.0 million par value of notes at 4.875% due 2005, which are reported with other current liabilities, as they will mature in August 2005. The carrying and estimated fair value of these notes was $149.8 million and $152.0 million respectively, at December 31, 2004. We have $2,600.0 million of senior unsecured notes that have fixed interest rates. These notes, at par value, included $200.0 million of notes at 3.50% due 2007, $300.0 million at 3.75% due 2007, $300.0 million at 4.25% due 2009, $800.0 million of 6.80% notes due 2012, $500.0 million at 5.00% due 2014 and $500.0 million at 5.95% due 2034. These notes had combined carrying and estimated fair value of $2,565.9 million and $2,707.6 million at December 31, 2004. Our subordinated debt includes surplus notes issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries. Par value of amounts outstanding at December 31, 2004 included $42.0 million of 9.125% surplus notes due 2010 and $25.1 million of 9.000% surplus notes due 2027. Any payment of interest or principal on the surplus notes may be 63 made only with the prior approval of the Indiana Department of Insurance. The combined carrying value of the surplus notes was $66.4 million and $494.1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The estimated fair value of the surplus notes exceeded the carrying value by $22.4 million and $157.9 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2004, we completed a tender offer to purchase a portion of these surplus notes, and purchased a net par value amount of $432.9 million. We recognized a loss of $146.1 million, which has been reported as loss on repurchase of debt securities in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2004. In addition to the surplus notes, our subordinated debt also includes $800.0 million, par value, of notes, including $450.0 million of 6.375% notes due 2006 and $350.0 million of 6.375% notes due 2012 that were obligations of WHN prior to the merger. This indebtedness was assumed in the WHN merger by Anthem Holding Corp., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of WellPoint. In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, this debt was recorded at estimated fair value as of November 30, 2004, the date of our merger. The carrying and estimated fair value at December 31, 2004 was $848.5 million and $854.5 million, respectively. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. Hedges We use derivative financial instruments, specifically interest rate swap agreements, to hedge exposure in interest rate risk on our borrowings. Our derivative use is limited to hedging purposes and we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. On December 13, 2004, we entered into a $300.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 3.75% rate for a LIBOR-based floating rate. This swap agreement expires on December 14, 2007. Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of this swap agreement. As of December 31, 2004, we recorded a liability of $0.8 million, the estimated fair value of the swap at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swap’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $8.4 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $8.6 million increase in fair value. 64",2023-12-30 18:53:22.452764

Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 I. Executive Summary We are the largest health benefits company in terms of membership in the United States, serving approximately 34 million medical members as of December 31, 2005. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee in California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensee for: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (as BCBS in 10 New York City metropolitan counties, and as Blue Cross or BCBS in selected upstate counties only), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the immediate suburbs of Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. We also serve customers throughout various parts of the country as UniCare. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states through our subsidiaries and in Puerto Rico through an affiliate. No other health benefits company has leading local market presence in so many geographic areas. This market position offers advantages in attracting physicians and hospitals to our networks at attractive rates and in helping to keep our products affordable. While we hold the leading position in these markets, all have additional room for expansion. Operating revenue reached an all-time high of $44.5 billion in 2005, a 118% increase over 2004. Operating revenue increases were driven by the merger with WellPoint Health Networks Inc., which represented approximately 111% of this increase, supplemented by organic revenue growth, particularly in the individual and small group business, known as ISG, Large Group and National Account businesses. We have successfully executed our strategy to deliver on our long-term goal of achieving at least 15% growth in fully diluted earnings per share, or EPS, which was exceeded in 2005 as our EPS increased by 29%. We have accomplished this by focusing on profitable enrollment growth with innovative product offerings, pricing with discipline, implementing initiatives to optimize the cost of care, continuing to leverage administrative costs over a larger membership base, further penetrating our specialty businesses and by using our cash flow effectively. We intend to continue expanding through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of the additional economies of scale provided by increased overall membership as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. While we have achieved strong growth as a result of strategic mergers and acquisitions, we have also achieved organic growth in our existing markets by providing excellent service, offering competitively priced products and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks. 36 Table of Contents II. Overview We manage our operations through three reportable segments: Health Care, Specialty and Other. Our Health Care segment includes strategic business units delineated primarily by geographic areas within which we offer similar products and services, including commercial accounts, individual, senior and government programs such as the Federal Employee Program, or FEP, and Medicaid. We offer a diversified mix of managed care products, including preferred provider organizations or PPOs, health maintenance organizations or HMOs, traditional indemnity benefits, consumer-driven health plans or CDHPs and point of service or POS plans. We also offer a variety of hybrid benefit plans, including consumer directed, hospital only and limited benefit products. Additionally, we provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers, including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management and other administrative services. Our Specialty segment is comprised of businesses providing pharmacy benefit management, group life and disability insurance benefits, behavioral health benefits, dental, vision, workers’ compensation and long-term care insurance. Our Other segment is comprised of our Medicare processing business, including AdminaStar Federal and United Government Services; Arcus Enterprises, which works to develop innovative means to promote quality care, well being and education; intersegment revenue and expense eliminations; and corporate expenses not allocated to our Health Care or Specialty segments. Effective December 31, 2005, Empire Medical Services, the Medicare processing company of the former WellChoice, was also included in our Other segment. Our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue comes from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. Administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, or where the fee is based on either processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized. Additionally, we earn administrative fee revenues from our Medicare processing business and from other health-related businesses including disease management programs. Other revenue is principally generated from member co-payments and deductibles associated with the mail-order sale of drugs by our pharmacy benefit management companies. Our benefit expense includes costs of care for health services consumed by our members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. Our selling expense consists of external broker commission expenses, and generally varies with premium volume. Our general and administrative expense consists of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Other costs are variable or discretionary in nature. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium, but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels, and thus salary and benefit expense. Discretionary costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity. Our cost of drugs consists of the amounts we pay to pharmaceutical companies for the drugs we sell via mail order through our pharmacy benefit management companies, or PBM. This amount excludes the cost of drugs 37 Table of Contents related to customers of affiliated health plans, which are recorded in benefit expense. Our cost of drugs can be influenced by the volume of prescriptions at our PBM, as well as cost changes, driven by prices set by pharmaceutical companies and mix of drugs sold. Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management programs. Several economic factors related to health care costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage and direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating health care costs as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material impact on our results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K. III. Significant Transactions Merger with WellChoice, Inc. On December 28, 2005 (December 31, 2005 for accounting purposes), WellPoint and WellChoice, Inc., or WellChoice, completed their previously announced merger. The acquisition of WellChoice strengthened our leadership in providing health benefits to National Accounts and provided us with a strategic presence in New York City, the headquarters of more Fortune 500 companies than any other U.S. city. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the stockholders of WellChoice (other than subsidiaries of WellPoint) received consideration of $38.25 in cash and 0.5191 of a share of WellPoint common stock for each share of WellChoice common stock outstanding. In addition, WellChoice stock options and other awards were converted to WellPoint awards in accordance with the merger agreement. The purchase price including cash, fair value of stock and stock awards and estimated transaction costs was approximately $6.5 billion. Multi-District Litigation Settlement Agreement On July 11, 2005, we announced that an agreement was reached with representatives of more than 700,000 physicians nationwide involved in two multi-district class-action lawsuits against us and other health benefits companies. As part of the agreement, we have agreed to pay $135.0 million to physicians and to contribute $5.0 million to a not-for-profit foundation whose mission is to promote higher quality health care and to enhance the delivery of care to the disadvantaged and underserved. In addition, up to $58.0 million will be paid in legal fees. As a result of the agreement, we incurred a pre-tax expense of $103.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, or $0.10 EPS, which represents the final settlement amount of the agreement that was not previously accrued. Acquisition of Lumenos, Inc. On June 9, 2005, we announced the completion of our acquisition of Lumenos, Inc., or Lumenos, for approximately $185.0 million in cash paid to the stockholders of Lumenos. The acquisition of Lumenos provided us with market leading consumer-driven health programs as well as the service experience with such programs and the customer tools that drive consumerism in health care today. Lumenos is recognized as a pioneer and market leader in consumer-driven health programs. Lumenos served approximately 177,000 members as of the date of acquisition. Two-For-One Stock Split On April 25, 2005, WellPoint’s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of shares of common stock, which was effected in the form of a 100 percent common stock dividend. All shareholders of record on May 13, 38 Table of Contents 2005 received one additional share of WellPoint common stock for each share of common stock held on that date. The additional shares of common stock were distributed to shareholders of record in the form of a stock dividend on May 31, 2005. All historical weighted average share and per share amounts and all references to stock compensation data and market prices of our common stock for all periods presented in this MD&A have been adjusted to reflect this two-for-one stock split. Merger with WellPoint Health Networks Inc. On November 30, 2004, Anthem, Inc. and WellPoint Health Networks Inc., or WHN, completed their merger. The merger with WHN helped us to create the nation’s leading health benefits company and the largest holder of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licenses in the country. Additionally, our merger with WHN increased our presence in several new strategic markets, most notably California. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the stockholders of WHN (other than subsidiaries of WHN) received consideration of $23.80 in cash and one share of Anthem, Inc. common stock for each WHN share outstanding. In addition, WHN stock options and other awards were converted to WellPoint, Inc. awards in accordance with the merger agreement. The purchase price including cash, fair value of stock and stock awards and estimated transaction costs was approximately $15.8 billion. Anthem, Inc., the surviving corporate parent, was renamed WellPoint, Inc. concurrent with the merger. IV. Membership—December 31, 2005 Compared to December 31, 2004 Our medical membership includes six different customer types: Large Group, Individual and Small Group, National Accounts, BlueCard Host, Senior and State Sponsored. • Large Group consists of those employer customers with 51 to 4,999 employees eligible to participate as a member in one of our health plans. In addition, Large Group includes customers with 5,000 or more eligible employees with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside the headquarter’s state. Large Group also includes members in the FEP, which provides health insurance coverage to United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. • Individual and Small Group, or ISG, consists of individual customers under age 65 as well as those employer customers with one to 50 eligible employees. • National Accounts customers are multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in a WellPoint service area with 5,000 or more eligible employees, with at least 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter’s state. Service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. • BlueCard host members represent enrollees of non-owned Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans who receive health care services in our Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensed markets. BlueCard membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer sponsored health plan issued by a non-WellPoint controlled Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee (i.e., the “home” plan). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard claims received per member per month. • Senior members are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a managed care alternative for the Medicare program, or who have purchased Medicare Supplement benefit coverage. • State Sponsored membership represents eligible members with state sponsored managed care alternatives in Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance programs. 39 Table of Contents In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain some or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some employers choose to purchase stop-loss coverage to limit their retained risk. These employers are reported with our self-funded business. The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and geographical region as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. Also included below are key metrics from our Specialty segment, including prescription volume for our PBM and membership by product. The membership data presented is unaudited and in certain instances includes estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

Medical membership is shown net of overlapping BlueCard host membership. 3 WellPoint without WellChoice membership was calculated by subtracting membership resulting from the WellChoice acquisition from WellPoint, Inc.’s reported membership at December 31, 2005. 4 Represents annual PBM prescription volume for mail order and retail prescriptions for the full years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. 5 Changes from prior period information are not meaningful due to different counting methodologies used by the former Anthem, Inc. and the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, total medical membership increased approximately 6,128,000, or 22%, primarily due to our acquisition of WellChoice and organic growth in all customer types. Excluding the impact of the WellChoice acquisition: BlueCard membership increased 545,000, or 16%, representing membership growth in other Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees with members who reside in or travel to our licensed areas; National Accounts membership increased 329,000, or 10%, primarily due to new sales, as well as, in-group increases in membership and members acquired from the acquisition of Lumenos; Large Group membership increased 204,000, or 2% primarily due to our acquisition of Lumenos as well as new sales throughout the year; State Sponsored membership increased 148,000, or 9% due to new sales, primarily in the West region; and ISG membership increased 97,000, or 2%, primarily due to the introduction of new, more affordable product designs and an overall increase in consumer awareness of our wide variety of quality products and services as well as efforts to market products to the uninsured. Self-funded medical membership increased 3,195,000 or 25%, primarily due to our merger with WellChoice and increases in our BlueCard, National Accounts and Large Group businesses. Fully-insured membership increased by 2,933,000 or 20%, due to our merger with WellChoice. However, on a comparable basis, fully-insured membership decreased by 56,000 primarily due to a Large Group fully-insured account in the East region, which represented approximately 140,000 medical members, converting to self-funded during the third quarter of 2005. This was partially offset by growth in our ISG and State Sponsored businesses, as well as new sales and positive in-group change in Large Group. Our specialty metrics are derived from membership and activity from our specialty products. These products are often ancillary to our health business, and can therefore be impacted by growth in our medical membership. The membership of these products can also be impacted by our efforts to increase the use of Specialty products by our medical members. Prescription volume at our PBM increased 8,080,000 prescriptions, or 2%, in 2005 primarily due to growth in both our mail order and retail operations. Behavioral Health membership increased 3,916,000, or 33%, in 2005. This growth was primarily due to the transition of 1,900,000 members from an external vendor to our in-house operation, as well as growth within our existing health lines of business, our increased offerings of specialty products to our medical members and a change in counting methodologies contributed to increased Behavioral Health’s membership growth. V. Cost of Care The following discussion summarizes our aggregate cost of care trends for the full year 2005 for our Large Group and ISG fully-insured businesses only. In order to provide a more meaningful comparison to the current period due to the merger with WHN, cost of care information as discussed below is presented as if pre-merger Anthem, Inc. and WHN were combined for all of 2004 and 2003. Accordingly, cost of care reported previously for pre-merger Anthem, Inc. is not comparable to the information presented below. Our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing the year-over-year change in average per member per month claim costs for which we are responsible, which excludes member co-payments and deductibles. While our cost of care trend varies by geographic location, our aggregate cost of care was less than 8.5% for the full year 2005. 41 Table of Contents Costs for outpatient and inpatient services are the primary drivers of overall cost trends, with outpatient trends moderating from 2004 levels. Cost trend increases for outpatient services were primarily driven by higher per visit costs as more procedures are being performed during each visit to outpatient providers, particularly emergency room visits, as well as the impact of price increases included within certain provider contracts. However, we are seeing the positive impact of our radiology management programs on our outpatient trends. These programs were implemented over most of our East and Central regions in late 2004 and early 2005 and are designed to ensure appropriate use of radiology services by our members. We are currently expanding these programs to our other regions. Inpatient trends have been driven primarily by unit cost, a reflection of negotiated contract increases with hospitals. Utilization (admissions per 1,000 members) remains flat, while average length of hospital stay and hospital days per 1,000 members have both decreased slightly. Pharmacy benefit cost trend, which previously had been a primary driver of overall trend increases, continues to decline as a result of an increase in generic usage rates, benefit plan design changes, improved pharmaceutical contracting resulting from the merger with WHN, the non-renewal of pharmacy only business from a large state customer with historically high utilization and cost trends effective July 1, 2005 and the impact of lower utilization for the COX 2 Inhibitor therapeutic class of drugs. Late in the third quarter of 2004, the arthritis drug VIOXX® was removed from the market due to concerns about the risk of heart attacks in persons taking this drug for longer than 18 months. We have provided our network physicians with information regarding alternatives to VIOXX and our PBM companies have implemented a process to ensure appropriate usage of the COX 2 Inhibitor therapeutic class of drugs. In response to cost trends, we continue to pursue contracting and plan design changes, promote and implement performance-based contracts that reward clinical outcomes and quality, and expand our radiology management, disease management and advanced care management programs. In addition, we are expanding our specialty pharmacy programs and continuously evaluate our drug formulary to ensure the most effective pharmaceutical therapies are available for our members. 42 Table of Contents VI. Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004 We discuss our operations using “comparable basis” information, which is presented in order to provide a more meaningful prior-year comparison to the current year, due to the merger with WHN. Comparable basis information is not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of WellPoint, Inc. had the merger been completed as of January 1, 2004. Comparable basis information for the year ended December 31, 2004 was calculated by adding the reclassified historical statements of income for the former WHN for the 11 months ended November 30, 2004 to the reported results of WellPoint, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2004, which includes one month of the former WHN. Comparable basis information contains no intercompany eliminations or pro forma adjustments resulting from the November 30, 2004 merger.

Premiums increased $22,445.1 million, or 120%, to $41,216.7 million in 2005. On a comparable basis, premium increased $2,649.9 million, or 7%, primarily due to premium rate increases in our Large Group, ISG and Senior businesses and membership gains in our ISG, State Sponsored and Senior membership types. Partially offsetting the impact of premium rate increases was the conversion of some Large Group customers from fully-insured contracts to self-funded arrangements and the non-renewal of certain fully-insured accounts. Administrative fees increased $1,293.0 million, or 90%, to $2,729.9 million in 2005. On a comparable basis, administrative fees increased $237.2 million, or 10%, primarily due to increased self-funded membership in our National and Large Group businesses. These membership gains are driven by the popularity of the BlueCard program, as well as successful efforts to attract large self-funded accounts and the continuing trend towards self-funded arrangements over fully-insured contracts among our Large Group customers. Other revenue is comprised principally of co-payments and deductibles associated with the sale of mail-order drugs by our PBM companies, which provides services to members of our Health Care segment and third party clients. Other revenue increased $314.1 million, or 124%, to $566.5 million in 2005. On a comparable basis, other revenue increased $43.3 million, or 8%, primarily due to additional mail-order prescription revenue and increased prices of prescription drugs sold by our PBM companies. Increased mail-order prescription volume resulted from both membership increases and additional utilization of our PBM’s mail-order pharmacy option. Net investment income increased $321.4 million, or 103%, to $633.1 million in 2005 primarily resulting from invested assets acquired with the WHN merger (net of cash used in the merger) and from growth in invested assets from reinvestment of cash generated from operations. A summary of our net realized (losses) gains on investments for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 is as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2005 20041 $ Change (In millions) Net realized (losses) gains from the sale of fixed maturity securities $ (25.3 ) $ 40.6 $ (65.9 ) Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities 22.0 3.3 18.7 Other-than-temporary impairments (14.8 ) (0.8 ) (14.0 ) Other realized gains (losses) 7.9 (0.6 ) 8.5 Net realized (losses) gains $ (10.2 ) $ 42.5 $ (52.7 ) 1 Includes operations of the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc. for the one month period ended December 31, 2004 and the former Anthem, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2004. In 2005, net realized gains and losses from the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities was primarily due to restructuring of our portfolio as a result of integration activities related to our merger with WHN. Net gains or losses on investments are influenced by market conditions when an investment is sold, and will vary from year to year. 45 Table of Contents During 2004, we reallocated securities in our fixed maturity portfolio, primarily to optimize future after-tax income by investing in a higher mix of tax-exempt fixed maturity securities. The sale of fixed maturity securities associated with this reallocation resulted in the majority of the net realized gains reported during the year ended December 31, 2004. Other-than-temporary impairments in 2005 were approximately equal between equity securities and fixed maturity securities, while in 2004, other-than-temporary impairments were substantially related to equity securities. Other-than-temporary impairments in both 2005 and 2004 are primarily due to the length of time that such securities’ fair value had been less than cost. Benefit expense increased $17,832.1 million, or 116%, to $33,219.9 million in 2005. On a comparable basis, benefit expense increased $1,938.7 million, or 6%, primarily due to increased cost of care, which was driven primarily by higher costs in outpatient and inpatient services. In addition, our benefit expense included $35.0 million in 2005 related to the multi-district litigation settlement agreement discussed in “Significant Transactions” above. On a comparable basis, our benefit expense ratio decreased 50 basis points from 81.1% in 2004 to 80.6% in 2005. The decrease in our benefit expense ratio is driven by moderating cost of care trends coupled with disciplined underwriting practices. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $3,795.0 million, or 109%, to $7,272.7 million in 2005. On a comparable basis, selling, general and administrative expense increased $435.4 million, or 6%, primarily due to increases in volume-sensitive costs such as higher commissions, premium taxes and other expenses associated with growth in our business; increased incentive compensation, including merger-related stay bonuses; and costs associated with the transition of information technology infrastructure services to IBM. In addition, we incurred expenses related to the multi-district litigation settlement agreement discussed in “Significant Transactions” above; and start-up costs related to Medicare Part D. On a comparable basis, our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 10 basis points to 16.3% in 2005, primarily due to growth in operating revenue and the leveraging of costs over a larger membership base, partially offset by the factors noted above. Cost of drugs increased $193.0 million, or 203%, to $288.0 million in 2005. On a comparable basis cost of drugs increased $18.2 million, or 7%, primarily due to higher retail and mail-order prescription volume at our PBM companies. Interest expense increased $83.9 million, or 59%, to $226.2 million in 2005, primarily due to additional interest expense on the debt incurred in conjunction with the WHN merger, partially offset by reduced interest expense from the repurchase of debt securities in December of 2004. Amortization of other intangible assets increased $177.5 million, or 289%, to $238.9 million in 2005, primarily due to a full year of additional amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets with finite lives resulting from the WHN merger. Income tax expense increased $943.3 million, or 195%, to $1,426.5 million in 2005. Included in 2005 was $28.4 million in tax benefits associated with a refund claim, recognizing the deductibility of capital losses on the sale of certain subsidiaries that occurred in prior years. Included in 2004 was $44.8 million in tax benefits associated with a change in Indiana laws governing the state’s high-risk health insurance pool. Our net income as a percentage of total revenue increased 90 basis points, from 4.6% in 2004 to 5.5% in 2005. The increase in this metric reflects a combination of all factors discussed above. Reportable Segments We manage our operations through three reportable segments: Health Care, Specialty and Other. We use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, as described in FAS 131, Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Operating gain is calculated as total 46 Table of Contents operating revenue less benefit expense, selling, general and administrative expense and cost of drugs. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, merger-related undertakings, loss on repurchase of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. For additional information, see Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. The discussions of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our segments’ operating revenue and operating gain for the year ended December 31, 2004 on a comparable basis are as follows. Comparable basis information was calculated as discussed above and is presented in order to provide investors with a more meaningful prior-year comparison to the current year, due to the merger with WHN. Comparable basis information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of WellPoint, Inc. had the merger been completed as of January 1, 2004.

On a comparable basis, operating revenue increased $2,946.4 million, or 7%, primarily due to growth in premium income as a result of premium rate increases in our Large Group and ISG businesses resulting from underwriting discipline. Also 47 Table of Contents contributing to premium revenue growth was higher membership, primarily in our ISG and State Sponsored businesses. Administrative fees also increased primarily due to additional self-funded membership in National Accounts and Large Group businesses. Operating gain increased $1,953.7 million, or 130%, to $3,459.0 million. On a comparable basis, operating gain increased $455.9, or 15%, primarily due to premium rate increases mentioned above along with membership growth and lower than expected cost of care within our ISG, Senior and Large Group businesses. Partially offsetting this increase was the impact of the $103.0 million pre-tax expense recognized in connection with the multi-district litigation settlement agreement in 2005. Specialty Our Specialty segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows: Years Ended December 31 % Change ComparableBasis Year EndedDecember 31,2004 $ Change % Change 2005 2004 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 2,863.1 $ 1,235.2 132 % $ 2,634.2 $ 228.9 9 % Operating gain $ 388.1 $ 100.9 285 % $ 332.9 $ 55.2 17 % Operating margin 13.6 % 8.2 % 540 bp 12.6 % 100 bp Operating revenue increased $1,627.9 million, or 132%, to $2,863.1 million. On a comparable basis operating revenue increased $228.9 million or 9%, primarily due to increases in PBM operating revenue driven by improved pharmaceutical contracting and increased script volume, particularly due to mail-order script volume. This increase was partially offset by decreases in behavioral health revenue due to the standardization in funding arrangements between Health Care and Specialty segments. Operating gain increased $287.2 million, or 285%, to $388.1 million. On a comparable basis operating gain increased $55.2 million or 17%, primarily due to an increase in PBM, behavioral health and dental businesses. On a comparable basis, PBM operating gain increased due to higher script volume and improved pharmaceutical contracting. In addition, operating gain from behavioral health increased as we standardized funding arrangements between the Health Care and Specialty segments. Finally, membership growth, driven primarily by the transition of 1.9 million behavioral health members from an outside vendor, also contributed to the improved results in Specialty segment. These gains are partially offset by decreased rates on workers’ compensation insurance in California driven by unfavorable legislation. Other Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 % Change ComparableBasis Year EndedDecember 31,2004 $ Change % Change 2005 2004 (In millions) Operating revenue from external customers $ 350.4 $ 212.8 65 % $ 372.8 $ (22.4 ) (6 )% Elimination of intersegment revenue $ (1,297.9 ) $ (741.6 ) 75 % $ (1,075.4 ) $ (222.5 ) 21 % Total operating revenue $ (947.5 ) $ (528.8 ) 79 % $ (702.6 ) $ (244.9 ) 35 % Operating loss $ (114.6 ) $ (105.8 ) 8 % $ (141.6 ) $ 27.0 19 % 48 Table of Contents Operating revenue from external customers increased $137.6 million, or 65%, to $350.4 million. On a comparable basis, operating revenue from external customers decreased $22.4 million, or 6% primarily due to the movement of certain businesses from the Other segment to the Health Care segment. The elimination of intersegment revenue increased $556.3 million, or 75%. On a comparable basis, the elimination of intersegment revenue increased $222.5 million or 21%, reflecting additional sales by our PBM companies to our Health Care segment. Operating loss increased $8.8 million, or 8%, to $114.6 million. On a comparable basis, operating loss decreased $27.0 million or 19%, primarily due to expenses not allocated to the Health Care or Specialty segments. VII.

Prescription volume for 2004 and 2003 is shown on a “comparable” basis. 4 Changes from prior period information are not meaningful due to different counting methodologies used by the former Anthem, Inc. and the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, total comparable medical membership increased approximately 1,678,000, or 6%, primarily in our National Accounts, BlueCard, and ISG businesses. Our National Accounts comparable membership increased 544,000, or 20%, primarily due to recognition of the value of Blue Cross and Blue Shield networks and the discounts we can secure, the breadth of our product offerings, and our distinctive customer service. BlueCard comparable membership increased 532,000, or 18%, representing increased sales by other Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees to accounts with members who reside in or travel to our licensed areas. ISG comparable membership increased 332,000, or 7%, primarily due to the introduction of new, more affordable product designs and an overall increase in consumer awareness of our wide variety of quality products and services as well as efforts to market products to the uninsured. Self-funded comparable medical membership increased 1,289,000, or 11%, primarily due to increases in our National Accounts and BlueCard businesses. Fully-insured comparable membership increased by 389,000 members, or 3%, primarily in our ISG business. Prescription volume at our PBM increased 36,911,000 prescriptions, or 12%, on a comparable basis in 2004 primarily due to the integration of our Virginia health membership to our internal PBM, as well as increased mail-order utilization and growth within our other existing health lines of business. Vision comparable membership increased 342,000, or 79%, due to the integration of internal health members, as well as increased sales. 50 Table of Contents VIII. Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 20041 20031 $ Change % Change (In millions, except per share data) Premiums $ 18,771.6 $ 15,167.7 $ 3,603.9 24 % Administrative fees 1,436.9 1,160.2 276.7 24 Other revenue 252.4 159.2 93.2 59 Total operating revenue 20,460.9 16,487.1 3,973.8 24 Net investment income 311.7 278.1 33.6 12 Net realized gains on investments 42.5 16.2 26.3 NM2 Total revenue 20,815.1 16,781.4 4,033.7 24 Benefit expense 15,387.8 12,254.5 3,133.3 26 Selling, general and administrative expense: Selling expense 537.2 411.2 126.0 31 General and administrative expense 2,940.5 2,686.3 254.2 9 Total selling, general and administrative expense 3,477.7 3,097.5 380.2 12 Cost of drugs 95.0 38.7 56.3 NM2 Interest expense 142.3 131.2 11.1 8 Amortization of other intangible assets 61.4 47.6 13.8 29 Merger-related undertakings 61.5 — 61.5 NM2 Loss on repurchase of debt securities 146.1 — 146.1 NM2 Total expense 19,371.8 15,569.5 3,802.3 24 Income before income taxes 1,443.3 1,211.9 231.4 19 Income taxes 483.2 437.6 45.6 10 Net income $ 960.1 $ 774.3 $ 185.8 24 % Average diluted shares outstanding 314.6 284.0 30.6 11 % Diluted net income per share $ 3.05 $ 2.73 $ 0.32 12 % Benefit expense ratio3 82.0 % 80.8 % 120 bp4 Selling, general and administrative expense ratio5 17.0 % 18.8 % (180) bp4 Income before income tax as a percentage of total revenue 6.9 % 7.2 % (30) bp4 Net income as a percentage of total revenue 4.6 % 4.6 % - bp4 Certain of the following definitions are also applicable to all other results of operations tables in this discussion: 1 Financial results for 2004 include operations of the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc. for the one month period ended December 31, 2004 and the former Anthem, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2004. Financial results for 2003 represent the results of the former Anthem, Inc. only and have been reclassified to conform to current presentation. 2 NM = Not meaningful 3 Benefit expense ratio = Benefit expense ÷ Premiums. 4 bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%. 5 Selling, general and administrative expense ratio = Total selling, general and administrative expense ÷ Total operating revenue. Premiums increased $3,603.9 million, or 24%, to $18,771.6 million in 2004, due to the impact of the merger with WHN, and premium rate increases in our Large Group and ISG businesses. Also contributing to premium 51 Table of Contents growth was higher fully-insured membership, primarily in our ISG business. Partially offsetting the growth were shifts by certain customers to self-funding arrangements, resulting in lower revenues. Included in 2003 were premium refunds of $40.4 million issued to policyholders from our Health Care segment, as claims costs in certain lines of business were much lower than expected. Our premium yields, net of buy-downs, for our fully-insured Large Group and ISG businesses were just less than 10% on a rolling 12-month basis as of December 31, 2004, including the business of pre-merger WHN for all periods. Administrative fees increased $276.7 million, or 24%, to $1,436.9 million in 2004, primarily due to increased revenues from self-funded membership, principally in National businesses, and also due to the impact of the merger with WHN. These increases were partially offset by decreased administrative fees from AdminaStar Federal’s 1-800 Medicare Help Line contract with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, which was substantially completed by June 30, 2003. Other revenue is comprised principally of co-payments and deductibles associated with the sale of mail-order drugs by our PBM, which provides its services to members of our Health Care segment and third party clients. Other revenue increased $93.2 million, or 59%, to $252.4 million in 2004, primarily due to additional mail-order prescription volume and increased prices of prescription drugs sold by our PBM, and also due to the impact of the merger with WHN. Increased mail-order prescription volume resulted from both membership increases and additional utilization of our PBM’s mail-order pharmacy option. Effective January 1, 2004, our PBM began to provide pharmacy benefit management services to Virginia customers of our Health Care segment. Net investment income increased $33.6 million, or 12%, to $311.7 million in 2004 primarily due to the merger with WHN. Our investment income also increased in 2004 due to the growth in invested assets from reinvestment of cash generated from operations, partially offset by a decrease in yields from new investments. Yields were lower in 2004 due in part to the impact of a portion of our fixed maturity portfolio being invested in shorter duration investments in anticipation of the WHN merger and the use of cash upon completion of the WHN merger on November 30, 2004. Yields were also lower in part due to an increased allocation of tax exempt securities in 2004, which is expected to enhance after tax income. A summary of our net realized gains on investments for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 is as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2004 2003 $ Change (In millions) Net realized gains from the sale of fixed maturity securities $ 40.6 $ 41.7 $ (1.1 ) Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities 3.3 0.5 2.8 Other-than-temporary impairments (0.8 ) (24.4 ) 23.6 Other realized losses (0.6 ) (1.6 ) 1.0 Net realized gains $ 42.5 $ 16.2 $ 26.3 Other-than-temporary impairments recognized in 2003 were substantially related to our equity security investments, primarily due to the length of time that the securities’ fair value had been less than cost. Benefit expense increased $3,133.3 million, or 26%, to $15,387.8 million in 2004. Benefit expense increased due to the impact of the merger with WHN, and also due to increased cost of care, which was driven primarily by higher costs in outpatient services and drug costs. Included in the 2003 results was a $31.7 million net favorable prior year reserve development recorded during the second quarter of 2003 and a $24.5 million favorable adjustment for resolution of a litigation matter in our Health Care segment in the first quarter of 2003. Our benefit expense ratio increased 120 basis points from 80.8% in 2003 to 82.0% in 2004, increasing from lower than anticipated cost of care trends in 2003 and returning to more sustainable levels. 52 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expense increased $380.2 million, or 12%, to $3,477.7 million in 2004, primarily due to the impact of the merger with WHN, and also due to increases in volume-sensitive costs such as higher commissions, premium taxes and other expenses associated with growth in our business and higher salary and benefits costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation in 2004, and $20.0 million of contributions to our charitable foundation made by our Health Care segment in 2003 which did not recur in 2004. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 180 basis points to 17.0% in 2004, primarily due to our growth in operating revenue and the leveraging of costs over these higher revenues. Cost of drugs increased $56.3 million, or 145%, to $95.0 million in 2004, primarily due to higher mail-order prescription volume at our PBM. Interest expense increased $11.1 million, or 8%, to $142.3 million in 2004, primarily due to additional interest expense on the $2.8 billion of debt initially incurred in conjunction with the WHN merger. Debt of $2.8 billion initially incurred in conjunction with the WHN merger was reduced to approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2004. Interest expense for this merger-related debt was incurred in December 2004. Amortization of other intangible assets increased $13.8 million, or 29%, to $61.4 million in 2004, primarily due to additional amortization expense on identifiable intangible assets resulting from the WHN merger. Merger-related undertakings were expenses recorded in 2004 related to certain obligations under our agreements with the California Department of Insurance, the California Department of Managed Health Care and the Georgia Department of Insurance. These agreements were related to the merger with WHN. The loss on repurchase of debt incurred in 2004 related to our tender offer for our high coupon surplus notes. Due to the high coupon on this debt and time remaining until stated maturity, the debt was repurchased at a significant premium over book value, which was the driver of the loss. Income tax expense increased $45.6 million, or 10%, to $483.2 million in 2004. Included in 2004 was $44.8 million in tax benefits associated with a change in Indiana laws governing the state’s high-risk health insurance pool recorded during the first quarter of 2004. Health Care Our Health Care segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2004 2003 $ Change % Change (In millions) Operating revenue $ 19,754.5 $ 16,000.1 $ 3,754.4 23 % Operating gain $ 1,505.3 $ 1,174.6 $ 330.7 28 % Operating margin 7.6 % 7.3 % 30 bp Operating revenue increased $3,754.4 million, or 23%, to $19,754.5 million in 2004, due to the impact of the merger with WHN, as the results of the acquired health business is included effective November 30, 2004. Operating revenue also increased due to premium rate increases in our Large Group, ISG, and Senior businesses. Also contributing to this growth were membership increases in our ISG and National Accounts businesses. Operating gain increased $330.7 million, or 28%, to $1,505.3 million, due to our merger with WHN, improved underwriting results in our Large Group business, and growth in our National Accounts businesses. Included in the 2003 results was a $31.7 million net favorable prior year reserve development recorded during the second quarter of 2003 and a $24.5 million favorable adjustment for resolution of a litigation matter in the 53 Table of Contents first quarter of 2003. Also included in 2003 were premium refunds of $40.4 million issued to policyholders as claims costs in certain lines of business were much lower than expected. Additionally, our Health Care segment made contributions of $20.0 million to our charitable foundation in 2003 that did not occur in 2004. Specialty Our Specialty segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2004 2003 $ Change % Change (In millions) Operating revenue $ 1,235.2 $ 732.0 $ 503.2 69 % Operating gain $ 100.9 $ 69.1 $ 31.8 46 % Operating margin 8.2 % 9.4 % (120) bp Operating revenue increased $503.2 million, or 69%, to $1,235.2 million in 2004, due to the impact of the merger with WHN, as the results of the acquired specialty business is included effective November 30, 2004. Operating revenue also increased due to increased mail-order prescription volume, including more specialty pharmacy prescriptions and increased wholesale drug costs which are passed through to customers of our PBM. Specialty pharmacy prescriptions include higher cost transactions for biopharmaceutical and injectable medications, which are complex in design and administration, and are costly to ship and store. The increased mail-order prescription volume resulted from both membership increases and additional utilization of our PBM’s mail-order pharmacy option. Effective January 1, 2004, our PBM began providing pharmacy benefit management services to our Virginia health members. Operating gain increased $31.8 million, or 46%, to $100.9 million in 2004, due to the impact of the merger with WHN, and increased mail-order prescription volume at our PBM. This improvement was partially offset by operating results in our other specialty businesses. Other Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2004 2003 $ Change % Change (In millions) Operating revenue from external customers $ 212.8 $ 197.8 $ 15.0 8 % Elimination of intersegment revenue (741.6 ) (442.8 ) (298.8 ) 67 % Total operating revenue $ (528.8 ) $ (245.0 ) $ (283.8 ) NM Operating loss $ (105.8 ) $ (147.3 ) $ 41.5 28 % Operating revenue from external customers increased $15.0 million, or 8%, to $212.8 million in 2004, due to the impact of the merger with WHN, as well as an increase in revenues from our Medicare customer service software development contract with CMS. These were partially offset by the loss of our 1-800 Medicare Help Line contract with CMS, which was substantially completed by June 30, 2003. Elimination of intersegment revenues increased $298.8 million, or 67%, reflecting additional sales by our pharmacy benefit management company to our Health Care segment. Operating loss decreased $41.5 million, or 28%, to $105.8 million in 2004, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses. 54 Table of Contents IX. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this Management’s Discussion and Analysis. We consider some of our most important accounting policies that require estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medial claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K. Medical Claims Payable The most judgmental accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2005, this liability was $4,923.4 million and represented 19% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for pending claims and claims that are incurred but not reported, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Pending claims are those received by us but not yet processed through our systems. Liabilities for both incurred but not reported and reported but not yet paid claims are determined employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not reported claims by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical data of paid claims is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. Actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months, the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or “trend factors”. Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns and claim submission patterns. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In the actuarial process, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated, rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense. In addition to the pending claims and incurred but not reported claims, the liability for medical claims payable includes reserves for premium deficiencies, if appropriate. Premium deficiencies are recognized when it is probable that expected claims and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums on existing medical insurance contracts without consideration of investment income. Determination of premium deficiencies for 55 Table of Contents longer duration life and disability contracts includes consideration of investment income. For purposes of premium deficiencies, contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. We regularly review our assumptions regarding claim liabilities and make adjustments to benefit expense when necessary. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each quarter and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that quarter. Prior year development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior year liability is no longer needed or that additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is accurate and will not fluctuate significantly with future development. As described above, the completion factors and trend factors can have a significant impact on the claim liability. The following example provides the estimated impact to our December 31, 2005 unpaid claims liability assuming hypothetical changes in the completion and trend factors: Completion Factor1 Claims Trend Factor2 (Decrease) Increase inCompletion Factor Increase (Decrease) in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease) Increase in ClaimsTrend Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (In millions) (In millions) (3)% $751.0 (3)% $(195.0) (2)% 489.0 (2)% (130.0) (1)% 239.0 (1)% (65.0) 1% (229.0) 1% 65.0 2% (448.0) 2% 130.0 3 % (659.0) 3 % 195.0 1 Assumes (decrease) increase in the completion factors for the most recent four months 2 Assumes (decrease) increase in the claims trend factors for the most recent two months In addition, assuming a hypothetical 1% total difference between our December 31, 2005 estimated claims liability and the actual claims paid, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 would increase or decrease by $32.0 million, while basic and diluted net income per share would increase or decrease by $0.05 per share. As summarized below, Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K provides historical information regarding the accrual and payment of our medical claims liability. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements, the line labeled “incurred related to prior years” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “incurred related to prior years” claims may be offset as we establish the estimate of “incurred related to current year”. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. We believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for unpaid claims liability at each reporting date. 56 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows: Years Ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) Gross medical claims payable, beginning of period $ 4,202.0 $ 1,841.7 $ 1,800.0 Ceded medical claims payable, beginning of period (31.9 ) (8.7 ) (2.8 ) Net medical claims payable, beginning of period 4,170.1 1,833.0 1,797.2 Business combinations and purchase adjustments 784.5 2,394.4 (20.6 ) Net incurred medical claims: Current year 33,471.0 15,452.6 12,374.2 Prior years (redundancies) (655.6 ) (172.4 ) (226.2 ) Total net incurred medical claims 32,815.4 15,280.2 12,148.0 Net payments attributable to: Current year medical claims 29,532.5 12,556.3 10,598.3 Prior years medical claims 3,341.8 2,781.2 1,493.3 Total net payments 32,874.3 15,337.5 12,091.6 Net medical claims payable, end of period 4,895.7 4,170.1 1,833.0 Ceded medical claims payable, end of period 27.7 31.9 8.7 Gross medical claims payable, end of period $ 4,923.4 $ 4,202.0 $ 1,841.7 Current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net incurred medical claims 88.2 % 81.3 % 85.6 % Prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims 4.2 % 1.4 % 2.3 % Amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled. Liabilities at any year end are continually reviewed and re-estimated as information regarding actual claims payments, or runout, becomes known. This information is compared to the originally established year end liability. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated. The prior year redundancy of $655.6 million shown in the table above and in Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005, represents an estimate based on paid claim activity from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005. Medical claim liabilities are usually described as having a “short tail”, which means that they are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the majority, or approximately 87%, of the $655.6 million redundancy relates to claims incurred in calendar year 2004, with the remaining 13% related to claims incurred in 2003 and prior. The ratio of current year paid as a percent of current year incurred was 88.2% for 2005, 81.3% for 2004, and 85.6% for 2003. The 2004 ratio was impacted by having only one month of medical claims incurred and paid during 2004 for the former WHN. If the former WHN had not been included during 2004, current year medical claims paid would have been $12,170.8 million, current year net incurred medical claims would have been $13,942.8 million and the adjusted ratio would have been approximately 87.3% for 2004. Comparison of the 2005 ratio of 88.2%, the adjusted 2004 ratio of 87.3% and the 2003 ratio of 85.6% indicate that we are paying claims faster. The increase is primarily attributable to improved processes and electronic connectivity with our provider networks. The result of these changes is an enhanced ability to adjudicate and pay claims more quickly. We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current period to net incurred medical claims recorded in each prior year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. This metric was 57 Table of Contents 4.2% for 2005, 1.4% for 2004 and 2.3% for 2003. This ratio is calculated using the redundancy of $655.6 million, shown above, which represents an estimate based on paid claim activity from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005. The 2005 ratio is impacted by having only one month of net incurred medical claims for WHN in 2004. If WHN had been included for the full year 2004 estimated prior year net incurred medical claims would have been $31,281.2 million, and the adjusted ratio would have been approximately 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The 2.3% ratio for 2003 was impacted by having only five months of net incurred medical claims in 2002 related to the former Trigon Healthcare, Inc. If the former Trigon Healthcare, Inc. had been included for the full year 2002, the ratio would have been approximately 2.0% for 2003. The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in the above table for each of 2004 and 2003 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims—current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims – prior years (redundancies)” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 2004 2003 (In millions) Total net incurred medical claims, as reported $ 15,280.2 $ 12,148.0 Retrospective basis, as described above 14,797.0 12,201.8 Variance $ 483.2 $ (53.8 ) Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported 3.2 % (0.4 )% The 2004 variance of $483.2 million and variance to total incurred medical claims, as reported of 3.2% are impacted by having only one month of total incurred as reported for WHN during 2004. The adjusted variance would be approximately $146.7 million and the variance to total incurred would be approximately 1.0% if the impact of WHN is removed. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2005 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2006. This table, adjusted for the impact of WHN, shows that our estimates of this liability have approximated the actual development. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This standard requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance. At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following: • the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset; • the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim; • the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and • any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences. During 2004 and 2003, the valuation allowance decreased by $33.8 million and $81.9 million, respectively. The 2004 and 2003 reductions resulted from utilizing alternative minimum tax, or AMT, credits and net operating losses on our federal income tax return for which we had a deferred tax asset with a corresponding 58 Table of Contents valuation allowance. As deferred tax assets related to those deductions are available for use in the tax return, a valuation was no longer required and was reduced. The decrease in the valuation allowance in 2004 was partially offset by an additional $5.6 million related to Indiana state taxes, as discussed below. During 2004 and 2003, we recorded additional tax liabilities of $44.1 million and $81.9 million, respectively, offsetting the reduction in valuation allowances discussed above. These additional liabilities were recorded for uncertainty on several tax issues, including the lack of clear guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, on various tax issues relating to our conversion in 1986 from tax exempt to tax paying status. During 2005, a refund claim we filed in 2003 was approved by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. The claim relates to initially disallowed losses on the sale of certain subsidiaries in the late 1990s. A tax benefit of $28.4 million related to this claim was recorded in the first quarter of 2005. Net income related to this claim was $0.04 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2005. As a result of legislation enacted in Indiana on March 16, 2004, we recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities, with a corresponding net tax benefit in our income statement of $44.8 million, or $0.15 per basic share and $0.14 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2004. The legislation eliminated the creation of tax credits resulting from the payment of future assessments to the Indiana Comprehensive Health Insurance Association, or ICHIA. ICHIA is Indiana’s high-risk health insurance pool. Our historical ICHIA assessment payments far exceeded our Indiana income tax liability. Thus, the recognition of a state deferred tax asset was not warranted, as a future Indiana tax liability was unlikely. Under the new legislation, ICHIA tax credits are limited to any unused ICHIA assessment paid prior to December 31, 2004. FAS 109 requires that deferred assets or liabilities be established in the period a change in law is enacted. These deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits relating to our Indiana income tax filings. Following guidance in FAS 109, a valuation allowance of $5.6 million was established for the portion of the deferred tax asset, which we believe will likely not be utilized. There is no carryforward limitation on the tax credits and the net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2018. We believe we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to offset these carryforwards; therefore, no additional valuation allowance was recorded. We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional tax liability for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for tax exposures. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted. In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and state authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intend to defend our positions vigorously through the IRS appeals process. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact to earnings from these matters. As of December 31, 2005, the IRS concluded its examination of our 2001 and 2002 tax years and has initiated its examination of our 2003 and 2004 tax years. Various tax examinations and proceedings also continue for pre-consolidation periods of subsidiaries. For additional information, see Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K. 59 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2005 was $13,469.1 million and other intangible assets were $9,686.4 million. The sum of goodwill and intangible assets represents 45% of our total consolidated assets and 93% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2005. We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and Statement of Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FAS 141 specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under FAS 142, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. We completed our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) for each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 and based upon these tests we have not incurred any impairment losses related to any goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives). On December 28, 2005, we completed our merger with WellChoice and purchased 100% of the outstanding common stock of WellChoice. In accordance with FAS 141, we allocated the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed. This allocation process included the review of relevant information about the assets and liabilities, independent appraisals and other valuations to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary allocation resulted in $3.4 billion of non-tax deductible goodwill and $1.7 billion of identifiable intangible assets. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and additional refinements may occur. On November 30, 2004, we completed our merger with WHN and purchased 100% of the outstanding common stock of WHN. In accordance with FAS 141, we allocated the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed. This allocation process included the review of relevant information about the assets and liabilities, independent appraisals and other valuations to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation resulted in $7.6 billion of non-tax deductible goodwill and $7.0 billion of identifiable intangible assets. While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, the annual impairment testing required under FAS 142 requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our goodwill and intangibles. Such assumptions include the discount factor used to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, which is ultimately used to identify potential goodwill impairment. Such estimated fair values might produce significantly different results if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If we are unable to support a fair value estimate in future annual goodwill impairment tests or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income. For additional information, see Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K. Investments Current and long term available-for-sale investment securities were $17,388.0 million at December 31, 2005 and represented 34% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2005. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, our fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as “available-for-sale” securities and are reported at fair value. We have determined that all available-for-sale investments in our portfolio, with the exception of certain securities held for contractual or regulatory purposes, are available to support current operations, and accordingly, have classified such securities as current assets. Investment income is recorded when earned, and realized gains or losses, determined by specific identification of investments sold, are included in income when the securities are sold. 60 Table of Contents In addition to available-for-sale investment securities, we held other long-term investments of $207.8 million, or 0.4% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2005. These long-term investments consist primarily of real estate and certain other investments. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term. An impairment review of securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We evaluate our investment securities on a quarterly basis, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. If any declines are determined to be other-than-temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made. We have a committee made up of certain accounting and investment associates and management responsible for managing the impairment review process. The current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment. The same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. We recorded charges for other-than-temporary impairment of securities of $14.8 million, $0.8 million and $24.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The $24.4 million impairment for the year ended December 31, 2003 included a $22.3 million charge for other-than-temporary impairment of our equity securities; primarily due to the length of time that such securities’ fair value had been less than cost. Management believes it has adequately reviewed the Company’s investment securities for impairment and that its investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change management’s judgment regarding impairment. This could result in realized losses relating to other-than-temporary declines being charged against future income. A summary of available-for-sale investments with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2005 along with the related fair value, aggregated by the length of time that investments have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, is as follows: Less than Twelve Months Twelve Months or More Total FairValue GrossUnrealizedLosses FairValue GrossUnrealizedLosses Fair Value GrossUnrealizedLosses (In millions) Fixed maturity securities $ 9,164.7 $ (134.2 ) $ 1,115.1 $ (26.9 ) $ 10,279.8 $ (161.1 ) Equity securities 403.9 (27.6 ) 4.8 (0.4 ) 408.7 (28.0 ) Total $ 9,568.6 $ (161.8 ) $ 1,119.9 $ (27.3 ) $ 10,688.5 $ (189.1 ) The Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, which impact the fair value of individual securities. Unrealized losses reported above were primarily caused by the effect of a rising interest rate environment on certain securities with stated interest rates currently below market rates. The Company currently has the ability and intent to hold these securities until their full cost can be recovered. Therefore, the Company does not believe the unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment as of December 31, 2005. The Company participates in securities lending programs whereby marketable securities in its investment portfolio are transferred to independent brokers or dealers based on, among other things, their creditworthiness in exchange for collateral initially equal to at least 102% of the value of the securities on loan and is thereafter maintained at a minimum of 100% of the market value of the securities loaned. The market value of the securities on loan to each borrower is monitored daily and the borrower is required to deliver additional collateral if the 61 Table of Contents market value of the collateral falls below 100% of the market value of the securities on loan. The fair value of the collateral amounted to $1,389.9 million and $658.5 million, which represents 102% and 102% of the carrying value at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Under the guidance provided in FAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, the Company recognizes the collateral as an asset, which is reported as “securities lending collateral” on its balance sheet and the Company records a corresponding liability for the obligation to return the collateral to the borrower, which is reported as “securities lending payable”. The securities on loan are reported in the applicable investment category on the balance sheet. Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage the market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits of investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future earnings and financial position. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $573.0 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $534.9 million increase in fair value. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $144.8 million. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $144.8 million. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K. Retirement Benefits Pension Benefits We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our employees, including plans sponsored by WellChoice and WHN prior to the related mergers. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FAS 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by FAS 87, we calculate the value of plan assets described below. Further, the effects on our computation of pension expense from the performance of the pension plans’ assets and changes in pension liabilities are amortized over future periods. Other than the former WellChoice plans, for each of our defined benefit pension plans, we use a September 30 measurement date for determining benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets. Plans sponsored by the former WellChoice use a December 31 measurement date. Prior to 2005 plans sponsored by pre-merger WHN used a December 31 measurement date. The effective rates discussed below are based on a weighted average of all the plans and include the effect of using two measurement dates. An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our last measurement dates, we selected an expected weighted average rate of return on plan assets of 7.80% for all plans (compared to a weighted average 8.16% for 2005 expense recognition). We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. The expected long-term rate of return is calculated by the geometric averaging method, which calculates an expected multi-period return, reflecting volatility drag on compound returns. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase. 62 Table of Contents This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our measurement dates. The weighted average discount rate for all plans is 5.31%, which was developed using a yield curve approach with consideration of a benchmark rate of the Moody’s Aa Corporate Bonds index. Using yields available on high-quality fixed maturity securities with various maturity dates, the yield curve approach provides a “customized” rate, which is meant to better match the expected cash flows of our specific benefit plans. Changes in the discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension expense, and the net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FAS 87. In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities and equity securities across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in the Company’s expense and cash flow. As of our measurement dates, we had approximately 56% of plan assets invested in equity securities, 37% in fixed maturity securities and 7% in other assets. Approximately $13.1 million, or less than 1% of plan assets, were invested in WellPoint common stock as of the measurement date. We funded our cash balance pension plans in the amount of $117.8 million during 2005 and $10.0 million during 2004. For the year ending December 31, 2006, the Company does not expect any required contributions under ERISA. The Company may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recognized consolidated pretax pension expense of $48.6 million, $40.8 million, and $21.3 million, respectively. Effective January 1, 2006, we curtailed the benefits under the Anthem Cash Balance Pension Plan, or the Plan. Most participants will no longer have pay credits added to their accounts, but will continue to earn interest on existing account balances. Participants will continue to earn years of pension service for vesting. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2006, will not be eligible to participate in the Plan. Certain participants will be “grandfathered” into the Plan based on age and years of service in previously merged plans. Grandfathered participants will continue to receive pay credits under the Plan formula. Expected savings that should be generated by the curtailment of benefits under the Plan will be mostly offset by increased matching contributions to certain defined contribution plans. Other Postretirement Benefits We provide most employees certain life, medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions including a discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits. We recognized a postretirement benefit liability of $472.3 million at December 31, 2005. At our last measurement dates, the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 5.29%. We developed this rate using a yield curve approach with consideration of a benchmark rate of the Moody’s Aa Corporate Bonds index. 63 Table of Contents The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of other benefits at our last measurement dates was 9.00% for 2006 with a gradual decline to 4.9% by the year 2011. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The health care cost trend assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2005 by $51.5 million and would increase service and interest costs by $3.5 million. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by $43.5 million as of December 31, 2005 and would decrease service and interest costs by $2.9 million. For additional information regarding retirement benefits, see Note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (“FAS 123R”). FAS 123R eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic method of accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (“APB 25”), and requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Subsequent to the issuance of FAS 123R, in April 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued an amendment to Rule 4-01(a) of Regulation S-X regarding the compliance date for FAS 123R. Under this amendment, the effective date of FAS 123R was extended to January 1, 2006, for most public companies with calendar year ends. The impact of adoption, effective January 1, 2006, on our consolidated results of operations is expected to amount to approximately 3% to 5% of net earnings and is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for our current disclosures of pro forma stock compensation expense. On March 29, 2005, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB 107”), which expresses the SEC staff’s view on FAS 123R. SAB 107 provides guidance regarding certain matters important to selecting and applying valuation models. We will consider SAB 107 in our implementation of FAS 123R. In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS Nos. 115-1 and FAS 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. In 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) issued EITF 03-1, The Meaning of Other-than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments to provide detailed guidance on when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other-than-temporary, how to measure the impairment loss and disclosures related to impaired securities. Because of concerns about the application of the guidance of EITF 03-1 that described whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, the FASB deferred the effective date of that portion of the guidance. This FSP nullifies EITF 03-1 guidance on determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, and effectively retains the previous guidance in this area, which requires a careful analysis of all pertinent facts and circumstances. (In addition, the FSP generally carries forward EITF 03-1 guidance for determining when an investment is impaired, how to measure the impairment loss and what disclosures should be made regarding impaired securities. The FSP is effective for reporting periods subsequent to December 15, 2005. Our current analysis of impaired investments is consistent with the provisions of this FSP (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Investments”). Therefore, the adoption of this FSP is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. There were no other new accounting pronouncements issued during 2005 that had a material impact on our financial position, operating results or disclosures. 64 Table of Contents X. Liquidity and Capital Resources Introduction Our cash receipts result primarily from premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchase of investment securities, interest expense, payments on long-term borrowings, capital expenditures and repurchase of our common stock. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have some negative impact on our liquidity. We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy. A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities, to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Excess capital at our subsidiaries is paid annually by subsidiaries in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. We have access to a $2.0 billion commercial paper program supported by a $2.5 billion senior credit facility, which allows us to maintain further operating and financial flexibility. Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 During 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was $3,256.7 million, as compared to $1,303.2 million in 2004, an increase of $1,953.5 million. The increase resulted from improved net income, including the impact of our merger with WHN. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2005 included a full year of WHN cash flow activity following the merger. Net cash used in investing activities was $4,420.2 million in 2005, compared to cash used of $2,373.9 million in 2004, an increase in cash used of $2,046.3 million. The table below outlines the changes in investing cash flow between the two years: Change inCash Used inInvestingActivities (In millions) Increase in net purchases of investments $ 1,749.7 Increase in net purchases of subsidiaries 349.8 Increase in net sale of subsidiaries (92.8 ) Decrease in proceeds from settlement of a cash flow hedge 15.7 Increase in net purchases of property and equipment 23.9 Net increase in cash used in investing activities $ 2,046.3 65 Table of Contents The purchase of investment securities in 2005 increased from 2004 resulting from increased cash flows from operations driven by improved net income, including the impact of our merger with WHN. The increase in 2005 subsidiary purchases resulted primarily from the use of cash for the WellChoice merger and Lumenos acquisition, as compared to cash used for the WHN merger in 2004. The increase in 2005 sale of subsidiaries resulted primarily from the receipt of cash for the sale of certain subsidiaries, as compared to no activity in 2004. Net cash flow provided by financing activities was $2,446.5 million in 2005 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $2,063.4 million in 2004. The table below outlines the increase in cash flow provided by financing activities of $383.1 million between the two years: Change inCash Providedby FinancingActivities (In millions) Increase in proceeds from exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan $ 270.3 Increase in repurchases of common stock (251.1 ) Net increase in proceeds from commercial paper borrowings 15.0 Decrease in repayment of long-term borrowings 643.4 Decrease in long-term borrowings (70.2 ) Decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock under Equity Security Units stock purchase contracts (230.0 ) Other 5.7 Net increase in cash provided by financing activities $ 383.1 The increase in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options reflects the significant increase in employees with vested options due to our merger with WHN. The increase in repurchases of common stock reflects the activity in our Board-approved common stock repurchase program. The decrease in repayments of long-term debt resulted primarily from the significant amount of repayments in 2004 as new long-term debt was issued to partially pay off outstanding long-term debt and fund the WHN merger. The decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under Equity Security Units stock purchase contracts reflects the maturity of these instruments in 2004. On January 10, 2006, we issued $700.0 million of 5.000% notes due 2011; $1,100.0 million of 5.250% notes due 2016; and $900.0 million of 5.850% notes due 2036 under a registration statement filed on December 28, 2005. The proceeds from this debt issuance were used to repay a bridge loan of $1,700.0 million and approximately $1,000.0 million in commercial paper borrowed to partially fund the WellChoice merger. Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 During 2004, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,303.2 million, as compared to $1,159.0 million in 2003, an increase of $144.2 million. The increase resulted from improved net income, including the impact of our merger with WHN, partially offset by a decline in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Our decline in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities included the impact of long-term compensation payments of approximately $113.0 million made during 2004 that had been accrued in prior years. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2004 included one month of WHN cash flow activity following the merger. 66 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities was $2,373.9 million in 2004, compared to cash used of $1,129.2 million in 2003, an increase in cash used of $1,244.7 million. The table below outlines the changes in investing cash flow between the two years: Change inCash Used inInvestingActivities (In millions) Decrease in net purchases of investments $ (999.3 ) Increase in net purchases of subsidiaries 2,233.3 Decrease in proceeds from settlement of a cash flow hedge (15.7 ) Increase in net purchases of property and equipment 26.4 Net increase in cash used in investing activities $ 1,244.7 The purchase of investment securities in 2004 decreased from 2003 as operating cash was retained for the WHN merger. The increase in 2004 subsidiary purchases resulted primarily from the use of cash for the WHN merger, as compared to minimal activity in 2003. The increase in net property and equipment purchases included one month of cash outflows for the pre-merger WHN companies. Net cash provided by financing activities was $2,063.4 million in 2004 compared to cash used in financing activities of $260.2 million in 2003. Financing activity related to the merger with WHN, as described below, contributed to the increase in cash provided by financing activities. Effective with the WHN merger, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in our commercial paper program from $1,000.0 million to $2,000.0 million. In December 2004, we initially borrowed $1,500.0 million under this commercial paper program, which was used to repay a portion of our senior credit facilities which were used at the date of the WHN merger to complete the transaction. On December 9, 2004, we issued $300.0 million of 3.750% Notes due 2007, $300.0 million of 4.250% Notes due 2009, $500.0 million of 5.000% Notes due 2014 and $500.0 million of 5.950% Notes due 2034. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $1,583.7 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses. Proceeds from these notes were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our bridge loan and five year credit facility, which were used at the date of the WHN merger to complete the transaction. In addition, a portion of the proceeds were used to fund the tender offer to purchase subsidiary surplus notes. The remainder of the proceeds was used to repay amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program described above. During 2004, we received $159.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program. These proceeds were offset by $82.2 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock. During 2003, $217.2 million was used to repurchase our common stock. In addition, $100.0 million was used to fund the payment of senior guaranteed notes, which matured on July 15, 2003. These payments were offset by $57.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program. Financial Condition We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, of $20.3 billion at December 31, 2005. Since December 31, 2004, total cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, increased by $4.5 billion, primarily resulting from the merger with WellChoice, as well as, improved net income driven by the merger with WHN. 67 Table of Contents Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Also, in connection with the WHN merger, the Company and certain of our subsidiaries in California and Georgia executed undertakings with the California Department of Managed Health Care, the California Department of Insurance and the Georgia Department of Insurance which contained various commitments, including the commitment to provide $61.5 million of support for health benefit programs in those states. Additional undertakings include the requirement to maintain certain capital levels at those subsidiaries. During 2005, we received $3.0 billion of dividends from our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005, we held at the parent company approximately $2.5 billion of our consolidated $20.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments, which is available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, share and debt repurchases and interest payments. Our consolidated debt-to-total capital ratio (calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt plus shareholders’ equity) was 21.4% as of December 31, 2005 and 18.6% as of December 31, 2004. Our senior debt is rated “BBB+” by Standard & Poor’s, “A-” by Fitch, Inc., “Baa1” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “a-” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. A significant downgrade in our debt ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs. Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity On December 28, 2005, we filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms of an offering and the securities being offered will be provided at the time of that offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt, capitalization of our subsidiaries or the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion. On January 10, 2006, we issued $700.0 million of 5.000% notes due 2011; $1.1 billion of 5.250% notes due 2016; and $900.0 million of 5.850% notes due 2036 under this registration statement. The proceeds from this debt issuance were used to repay a bridge loan of $1,700.0 million and $1,000.0 million in commercial paper borrowed to partially fund the WellChoice merger. On November 29, 2005, we entered into a senior revolving credit facility, or the facility, with certain lenders for general corporate purposes. The facility provides credit up to $2.5 billion (reduced for any commercial paper issuances) and matures on November 29, 2010. The interest rate on this facility is based on either (i) the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined percentage rate based on our credit rating at the date of utilization, or (ii) a base rate as defined in the facility agreement. Our ability to borrow under this facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. Commitment fees for the facility amounted to $1.4 million in 2005. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005, we had $898.6 million available under this facility. We have Board of Directors’ approval to borrow up to $2.0 billion under our commercial paper program. Proceeds from any issuance of commercial paper may be used for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of our debt and common stock. Commercial paper notes are short-term senior unsecured notes, with a maturity not to exceed 270 days from date of issuance. When issued, the notes bear interest at current market rates. There were $1.6 billion of borrowings outstanding under this commercial paper program as of December 31, 2005, The borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2005 are classified as long-term debt as our intent is to replace short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one year or with borrowings under our senior credit facilities. As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we are currently estimating approximately $2.1 billion of dividends to be paid to the parent company during 2006. 68 Table of Contents During December 2004, we completed a tender offer to purchase subsidiary surplus notes from the holders, and purchased $258.0 million of 9.125% notes due 2010 and $174.9 million of 9.000% notes due 2027. Future interest payments on these portions of the notes will be paid by the subsidiary to the parent company, and are expected to be approximately $39.2 million annually. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. As of December 31, 2005, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to an additional $2.0 billion of common stock. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares because we believe it is a prudent use of surplus capital. As previously disclosed, we were restricted from repurchasing shares in connection with WellChoice acquisition. Subsequent to the closing of the acquisition on December 28, 2005, we resumed the repurchase of our common stock in January 2006. Given our liquidity and current market conditions, we have been able to execute repurchases under our program in accordance with our strategic plan. Our current pension funding strategy is to fund an amount at least equal to the minimum required funding as determined under ERISA with consideration of factors such as the minimum pension liability requirement and maximum tax deductible amounts. During the year ended December 31, 2005, no contributions under ERISA were required, however, the Company made tax deductible discretionary contributions of $117.8 million. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2005 are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 Years (In millions) Long-term debt, including capital leases1 $ 8,606.6 $ 3,966.9 $ 825.6 $ 640.9 $ 3,173.2 Operating lease commitments 1,098.8 145.0 240.5 208.5 504.8 Projected other postretirement benefits 987.7 35.8 201.3 205.1 545.5 Purchase obligations: IBM outsourcing agreements2 1,022.8 185.2 326.3 302.3 209.0 Other purchase obligations3 74.0 57.0 16.1 0.9 — Other long-term liabilities 899.9 19.3 356.4 345.2 179.0 Venture capital commitments 22.5 8.7 9.7 4.1 — Total contractual obligations and commitments $ 12,712.3 $ 4,417.9 $ 1,975.9 $ 1,707.0 $ 4,611.5 1 Includes estimated interest expense. 2 Relates to agreements with International Business Machines Corporation to provide information technology infrastructure services. See Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 for further information. 3 Includes obligations related to IT service agreements and telecommunication contracts. In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our credit agreements or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions. For additional information on our debt and lease commitments, see Notes 7 and 16, respectively, to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K. 69 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have agreed to guarantee up to $37.0 million of debt incurred by an unaffiliated entity to partially finance the purchase of a hospital. In connection with an investment in a joint venture to develop and operate a well-being center in California, we may be required, based on specific targets, to make an additional $18.0 million contribution following completion of the well-being center. We anticipate the well-being center will be completed during 2006. In connection with the formation of a joint venture providing Medicaid services in Puerto Rico, we agreed under certain circumstances to provide additional funding to the joint-venture entity. As of December 31, 2005, our maximum potential liability pursuant to this guarantee was $30.3 million. We have not been required to make any payments under this guarantee and we do not currently expect any such payments will be made. For additional information on these off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K. Risk-Based Capital Our regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies largely based on the NAIC’s RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under this Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our risk-based capital as of December 31, 2005, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, was in excess of all mandatory RBC thresholds. In addition to exceeding the RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries.

As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on WellPoint’s financial position as of December 31, 2005. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return. Investments Our investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk. The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit downgrade to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that downgrade. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately AA. Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities, due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which represent an exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value. Our portfolio includes corporate securities (approximately 38% of the total fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2005), which are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. This risk is managed through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately A. Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, 71 Table of Contents driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systematic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 90% of our available-for-sale investments were fixed maturity securities. Market risk is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $573.0 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $534.9 million increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly. Our available-for-sale equity securities portfolio, as of December 31, 2005, was approximately 10% of our investments. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $144.8 million. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $144.8 million. Long-Term Debt Our total long-term debt at December 31, 2005 was $6.8 billion, and included $1.6 billion of commercial paper and $1.7 billion under a senior bridge facility. The carrying value of the commercial paper and bridge facility approximates fair value as the underlying instruments have variable interest rates at market value. The remainder of the debt is subject to interest rate risk as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2005, we had $3.4 billion of senior unsecured notes with fixed interest rates. These notes, at par value, included $450.0 million at 6.375% due 2006, $200.0 million at 3.50% due 2007, $300.0 million at 3.75% due 2007, $300.0 million at 4.25% due 2009, $350.0 million at 6.375% due 2012, $800.0 million at 6.80% due 2012, $500.0 million at 5.00% due 2014 and $500.0 million at 5.95% due 2034. These notes had combined carrying and estimated fair value of $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2005. Our subordinated debt includes surplus notes issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries. Par value of amounts outstanding at December 31, 2005 included $42.0 million of 9.125% surplus notes due 2010 and $25.1 million of 9.000% surplus notes due 2027. Any payment of interest or principal on the surplus notes may be made only with the prior approval of the Indiana Department of Insurance. The combined carrying value of the surplus notes was $66.5 million and $66.4 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The estimated fair value of the surplus notes exceeded the carrying value by $16.7 million and $22.4 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. Derivatives We use derivative financial instruments, specifically interest rate swap agreements, to hedge exposure in interest rate risk on our borrowings. Our derivative use is generally limited to hedging purposes and we generally do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we entered into two fair value hedges with a total notional value of $660.0 million. The first hedge is a $360.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 6.8% rate for a LIBOR-based floating rate and expires on August 1, 2012. The second hedge is a $300.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 5.00% rate for LIBOR-based floating 72 Table of Contents rate and expires December 15, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we entered into a $300.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 3.75% rate for a LIBOR-based floating rate. This swap agreement expires on December 14, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we entered into a floating to fixed rate cash flow hedge with a total notional value of $480.0 million. The purpose of this hedge is to offset the variability of the cash flows due to the rollover of our variable-rate one-month commercial paper issuance. This swap agreement expires in December 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2005, no gain or loss from hedged ineffectiveness was recorded in earnings and the commercial paper borrowings remain outstanding at December 31, 2005. The unamortized fair value included in accumulated comprehensive income at December 31, 2005 was $3.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we entered into forward starting pay fixed swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $875.0 million. The objective of these hedges was to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the interest payments on the debt securities to be issued to partially fund the cash portion of the WellChoice merger. The unamortized fair value included in accumulated comprehensive income at December 31, 2005 was $12.5. As of December 31, 2005, the total amount of amortization over the next twelve months is expected to increase interest expense by approximately $0.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we entered into forward starting pay fixed swaps and treasury lock swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $2.0 billion. The objective of these hedges was to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the interest payments on the debt securities to be issued to partially fund the cash portion of the WHN merger. Upon termination of these swaps in 2004, we received a net $15.7 million, the net fair value at the times of termination. In addition, we recorded an unrealized gain of $10.2 million, net of tax, as accumulated other comprehensive income. Prior to the WHN merger, we reclassified $0.7 million ($0.5 million, net of tax) to net realized gains on investment for the portion of the hedges that were deemed not probable of occurring. Following the completion of the WHN merger on November 30, 2004, we issued debt securities, and the unamortized fair value of the forward starting pay fixed swaps included in balances in accumulated other comprehensive income began amortizing into earnings, as a reduction of interest expense, over the life of the debt securities. The unamortized fair value included in accumulated comprehensive income at December 31, 2005 was $8.9 million. As of December 31, 2005, the total amount of amortization over the next twelve months will decrease interest expense by approximately $1.3 million. Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these swap agreements. As of December 31, 2005, we recorded an asset of $5.6 million and a liability of $44.9 million, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swap’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $61.6 million increase in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $78.0 million decrease in fair value. 73 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:53:32.068572

Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 I. Executive Summary We are the largest health benefits company in terms of commercial membership in the United States, serving over 34 million medical members as of December 31, 2006. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or BCBS, licensee for: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (as BCBS in 10 New York City metropolitan and surrounding counties, and as Blue Cross or BCBS in selected upstate counties only), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. We also serve customers throughout the country as UniCare. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states through our subsidiaries. No other health benefits company has the leading local market presence in as many geographic areas. This market position offers advantages in attracting physicians and hospitals to our networks at attractive rates and in helping to keep our products affordable. Operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $56.1 billion, an increase of $12.2 billion, or 28%, over the year ended December 31, 2005. Operating revenue increases were primarily driven by the December 28, 2005 acquisition of WellChoice, Inc., or WellChoice, described in “Significant Transactions” below, as well as premium rate increases across all customer types, the addition of the New York state prescription drug contract and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan, or Medicare Part D, enrollment. We have successfully executed our strategy to deliver on our long-term goal of achieving at least 15% growth in fully diluted earnings per share, or EPS, and exceeded our goal in 2006 as our EPS increased by 22%. We have accomplished this by focusing on profitable enrollment growth with innovative product offerings, pricing with discipline, implementing initiatives to optimize the cost of care, continuing to leverage administrative costs over a larger membership base, further penetrating our specialty businesses and by using our cash flow effectively. 40 Table of Contents We intend to continue expanding through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions and transactions in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of the additional economies of scale provided by increased overall membership as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. While we have achieved strong growth as a result of strategic mergers and acquisitions, we have also achieved organic growth in our existing markets by providing excellent service, offering competitively priced products and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks. Effective January 1, 2006, we began marketing Medicare Part D to eligible Medicare beneficiaries in all 50 states. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 1.6 million Medicare Part D members. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information regarding Medicare Part D. II. Overview Through December 31, 2006, we managed our operations through three reportable segments: Health Care, Specialty and Other. Our Health Care segment includes strategic business units delineated primarily by geographic areas within which we offer similar products and services, including commercial accounts, individual, senior and government programs such as the Federal Employee Program, or FEP, and Medicaid. We offer a diversified mix of managed care products, including preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, traditional indemnity benefits and point of service, or POS plans. We also offer a variety of hybrid benefit plans, including consumer-driven health plans, or CDHPs, hospital only and limited benefit products. Additionally, we provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers, including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical management, care management and other administrative services. Our Specialty segment is comprised of businesses providing specialty products and services such as group life and disability insurance benefits, pharmacy benefit management, or PBM, specialty pharmacy, dental, vision, behavioral health benefit services and long-term care insurance. We ceased underwriting workers compensation business effective December 31, 2005; however, we continue to provide network rental and medical management services to workers compensation carriers. Our Other segment is comprised of our Medicare processing business, including National Government Services, Inc., which name changed from AdminaStar Federal, Inc., effective November 17, 2006, United Government Services, LLC, and Empire Medicare Services, Inc.; Arcus Healthy Living Services, Inc., which works to develop innovative means to promote quality care, well being and education; Arcus Financial Services, Inc., which provides a number of products to WellPoint-owned health plans associated with tax-advantaged accounts such as Health Savings Accounts, Flexible Spending Accounts and Health Reimbursement Accounts; intersegment revenue and expense eliminations; and corporate expenses not allocated to our Health Care or Specialty segments. We have announced a new organizational structure designed to support our 2010 strategic plan. This new structure capitalizes on our unique local presence and emphasizes company-wide innovation and strong customer focus. As a result of this new organizational structure we are organized around two strategic business units: Commercial and Consumer Business, or CCB, and Specialty, Senior and State-Sponsored Business, or 4SB. In addition, our government services business includes the Federal Employees Program and National Government Services, Inc., which acts as a Medicare contractor in several regions across the nation. We expect to revise our reportable segments in the first quarter of 2007 in accordance with the new organizational structure, which reflects how our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our business beginning January 1, 2007. See Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this Form 10-K. 41 Table of Contents Our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue comes from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. Administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, or where the fee is based on either processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized. Additionally, we earn administrative fee revenues from our Medicare processing business and from other health-related businesses including care management programs. Other revenue is principally generated from member co-payments and deductibles associated with the mail-order sale of drugs by our PBM companies. Our benefit expense includes costs of care for health services consumed by our members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug costs. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. Our selling expense consists of external broker commission expenses, and generally varies with premium volume. Our general and administrative expense consists of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Other costs are variable or discretionary in nature. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium, but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels, and thus salary and benefit expense. Discretionary costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity. Our cost of drugs consists of the amounts we pay to pharmaceutical companies for the drugs we sell via mail order through our PBM. This amount excludes the cost of drugs related to affiliated health customers recorded in benefit expense. Our cost of drugs can be influenced by the volume of prescriptions at our PBM, as well as cost changes, driven by prices set by pharmaceutical companies and mix of drugs sold. Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical and care management programs. Several economic factors related to health care costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage and direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating health care costs as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material impact on our results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this Form 10-K. III. Significant Transactions Stock Repurchase Program We maintain a common stock repurchase program as authorized by our Board of Directors. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 60.7 million shares at an average share price of $74.91, for an aggregate cost of $4.6 billion. On March 15, May 16, August 17 and 42 Table of Contents December 7, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized increases of $1.0 billion, $1.0 billion, $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, in our common stock repurchase program, which increased the total authorized common stock repurchases to $5.5 billion since the current program’s inception in 2005. As of December 31, 2006, $0.9 billion remained authorized for future repurchases. Subsequent to December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 6.0 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $463.5 million, leaving approximately $486.3 million for authorized future repurchases at February 12, 2007. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares because we believe it is a prudent use of surplus capital. Acquisition of WellChoice, Inc. On December 28, 2005 (December 31, 2005 for accounting purposes), WellPoint completed its acquisition of WellChoice. The acquisition of WellChoice strengthened our leadership in providing health benefits to National Accounts and provided us with a strategic presence in New York City, the headquarters of more Fortune 500 companies than any other U.S. city. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the stockholders of WellChoice (other than subsidiaries of WellPoint) received consideration of $38.25 in cash and 0.5191 of a share of WellPoint common stock for each share of WellChoice common stock outstanding. In addition, WellChoice stock options and other awards were converted to WellPoint awards in accordance with the merger agreement. The purchase price including cash, fair value of stock and stock awards and estimated transaction costs was approximately $6.5 billion. Multi-District Litigation Settlement Agreement On July 11, 2005, we announced that an agreement was reached with representatives of more than 700,000 physicians nationwide involved in two multi-district class-action lawsuits against us and other health benefits companies. As part of the Multi-District Litigation Settlement Agreement, or the Agreement, we agreed to pay $135.0 million to physicians and to contribute $5.0 million to a not-for-profit foundation whose mission is to promote higher quality health care and to enhance the delivery of care to the disadvantaged and underserved. In addition, up to $58.0 million will be paid in legal fees. As a result of the Agreement, we incurred a pre-tax expense of $103.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, or $0.10 EPS, which represents the final settlement amount of the Agreement that was not previously accrued. Appeals of the settlement initially filed by certain physicians were resolved and final cash payments under the agreement totaling $209.5 million, including accrued interest, were made on October 5 and 6, 2006. Acquisition of Lumenos, Inc. On June 9, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Lumenos, Inc., or Lumenos, for approximately $185.0 million in cash paid to the stockholders of Lumenos. Lumenos is recognized as a pioneer and market leader in consumer-driven health programs. Two-For-One Stock Split On April 25, 2005, WellPoint’s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of shares of common stock, which was effected in the form of a 100 percent common stock dividend. All shareholders of record on May 13, 2005 received one additional share of WellPoint common stock for each share of common stock held on that date. The additional shares of common stock were distributed to shareholders of record in the form of a stock dividend on May 31, 2005. All historical weighted average share and per share amounts and all references to stock compensation data and market prices of our common stock for all periods presented in this MD&A have been adjusted to reflect this two-for-one stock split. Merger with WellPoint Health Networks Inc. On November 30, 2004, Anthem, Inc. and WellPoint Health Networks Inc., or WHN, completed their merger. The merger with WHN helped us to create the nation’s leading health benefits company and the largest 43 Table of Contents holder of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licenses in the country. Additionally, our merger with WHN increased our presence in several new strategic markets, most notably California. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the stockholders of WHN (other than subsidiaries of WHN) received consideration of $23.80 in cash and one share of Anthem, Inc. common stock for each WHN share outstanding. In addition, WHN stock options and other awards were converted to WellPoint, Inc. awards in accordance with the merger agreement. The purchase price including cash, fair value of stock and stock awards and estimated transaction costs was approximately $15.8 billion. Anthem, Inc., the surviving corporate parent, was renamed WellPoint, Inc. concurrent with the merger. IV. Membership—December 31, 2006 Compared to December 31, 2005 Through December 31, 2006, our medical membership included six different customer types: Large Group, Individual and Small Group, National Accounts, BlueCard, Senior and State Sponsored. • Large Group consists of those employer customers with 51 to 4,999 employees eligible to participate as a member in one of our health plans. In addition, Large Group includes customers with 5,000 or more eligible employees with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter’s state. Large Group also includes members in the Federal Employee Program, or FEP, which provides health insurance coverage to United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. • Individual and Small Group, or ISG, consists of individual customers under age 65 as well as those employer customers with one to 50 eligible employees. • National Accounts customers are multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in a WellPoint service area with 5,000 or more eligible employees, with at least 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter’s state. Service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. • BlueCard host members represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by WellPoint who receive health care services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-WellPoint controlled BCBSA licensee (i.e., the “home” plan). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard claims received per member per month. • Senior members are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a managed care alternative for the Medicare program, or who have purchased Medicare Supplement benefit coverage. • State Sponsored membership represents eligible members with state sponsored managed care alternatives in Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance programs. We expect to revise our customer type definitions in the first quarter of 2007 in accordance with the new organizational structure, as described above, which reflects how our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our business beginning January 1, 2007. In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who 44 Table of Contents elect to retain some or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some customers choose to purchase stop-loss coverage to limit their retained risk. These customers are reported with our self-funded business. The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and geographical region as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. Also included below are key metrics from our Specialty segment, including prescription volume for our PBM companies and membership by product. The membership data presented is unaudited and in certain instances includes estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

Our reclassifications for minimum premium amendments to fully-insured contracts resulted in an increase in self-funded membership and a corresponding decrease in fully-insured membership, with no impact on total medical membership. 2 Represents prescription volume for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. 3 Effective January 1, 2006, the Company began marketing Medicare Part D to eligible Medicare beneficiaries in all 50 states. Membership includes auto-assigned, stand-alone, Medicare Advantage, group waiver and external PBM members with the prescription drug plans. Certain of our Medicare Part D members are also Senior medical members. 45 Table of Contents During the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, total medical membership increased approximately 245,000, or 1%, primarily due to increases in our BlueCard and National Accounts partially offset by the loss of 315,000 Large Group members in the state of Georgia, as well as approximately 95,000 members of another Large Group account, which was previously disclosed. Also, in December 2006, our ownership of a joint venture in Puerto Rico changed from a 50 percent ownership of a Medicaid managed care subsidiary to a smaller percentage in the joint venture’s parent company. Accordingly, we no longer include the 222,000 members related to this investment in our reported enrollment. Large Group membership decreased 348,000, or 2%, primarily due to the loss of the state of Georgia PPO contract and the other Large Group account previously disclosed, partially offset by new sales. National Accounts membership increased 268,000, or 6%, primarily due to success in attracting new customers as they recognize the value of the BCBS networks and discounts. BlueCard membership increased 364,000, or 9%, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, due to increased sales by other BCBSA licensees to accounts with members who reside in or travel to our licensed areas. State Sponsored membership decreased 53,000, or 3%, primarily due to the membership accounting change related to our Puerto Rico joint venture investment discussed above. Partially offsetting this 222,000 member decrease, we added 68,000 new members from the acquisition of QualChoice Select, Inc. and won new business from five awards in 2006 due to our comprehensive array of health management services we make available to the nation’s Medicaid recipients. Self-funded medical membership increased 161,000, or 1%, primarily due to increases in our National Accounts and BlueCard businesses and shifts in the mix of business from fully-insured to self-funded, partially offset by the loss of the state of Georgia PPO contract and the other Large Group contract noted above, as well as the impact of the Puerto Rico joint venture membership accounting change. Fully-insured membership increased by 84,000 members, primarily due to the August 1, 2006 acquisition of QualChoice Select, Inc. Our specialty metrics are derived from membership and activity from our specialty products. These products are often ancillary to our health business, and can therefore be impacted by growth in our medical membership. Prescription volume in our PBM companies increased by 48,047,000, or 14%, during the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to growth in both our retail and mail order operations driven by the addition of Medicare Part D. Behavioral health membership increased 1,268,000, or 8%, during the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to a 568,000 membership gain from the acquisition of Behavioral Health Network in New Hampshire in October 2006, as well as 347,000 new members from sales of our behavioral health products. Vision membership increased 720,000, or 88%, due to the introduction of our Blue View Vision product and the associated conversion of 432,000 members of a competing plan in Virginia to this new product, as well as new sales in several markets. V. Cost of Care The following discussion summarizes our aggregate cost of care trends for the full year 2006 for our Large Group and ISG fully-insured businesses only. In order to provide a more meaningful comparison to the current period due to the acquisition of WellChoice, cost of care information as discussed below is presented as if WellPoint and WellChoice were combined for all of 2005. Accordingly, cost of care reported previously for WellPoint is not comparable to the information presented below. 46 Table of Contents Our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing the year-over-year change in average per member per month claim costs for which we are responsible, which excludes member co-payments and deductibles. While our cost of care trend varies by geographic location, our aggregate cost of care was less than 8% for the full year 2006. Costs for outpatient and inpatient services are the primary drivers of overall cost trends. Cost trend increases for outpatient services were primarily driven by higher per visit costs as more procedures are being performed during each visit to outpatient providers, particularly emergency room visits, as well as the impact of price increases included within certain provider contracts. However, we are seeing the positive impact of our expanding radiology management programs on our outpatient trends. These programs are designed to ensure appropriate use of radiology services by our members. Inpatient trends have been driven primarily by unit cost, a reflection of negotiated contract increases with hospitals. Utilization (admissions per 1,000 members) remains flat, while average length of hospital stay and hospital days per 1,000 members have both decreased slightly. Pharmacy benefit cost trend increased primarily due to pharmacy unit cost (cost per prescription) trend. The unit cost trend in 2006 is reflecting a return to normal cost trends compared to 2005 when the unit cost trend was favorably impacted by merger synergies and improved pharmaceutical contracting following the merger with WHN, the non-renewal of pharmacy only business from a large state customer with historically high utilization and cost trends and the impact of lower utilization for the COX 2 Inhibitor therapeutic class of drugs. In addition, the increased use of specialty drugs, also known as biotech drugs, which generally have a higher cost and are being utilized more frequently, has increased the unit cost trend in 2006. These increases in unit costs were partially offset by increases in our generic usage rates and benefit plan design changes. In response to cost trends, we continue to pursue contracting and plan design changes, promote and implement performance-based contracts that reward clinical outcomes and quality, and expand our radiology management, disease management and advanced care management programs. We recently announced the launch of 360º Health, a program to integrate all care management programs and tools into a centralized, consumer-friendly resource that assists patients in navigating the health care system, using their health benefits and accessing the most comprehensive and appropriate care available. In addition, we are expanding our specialty pharmacy programs and continuously evaluate our drug formulary to ensure the most effective pharmaceutical therapies are available for our members. 47 Table of Contents VI. Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are discussed in the following section.

We discuss our 2006 and 2005 operations using “comparable basis” information, which is presented to provide a more meaningful prior-year comparison to the current year, due to our December 28, 2005 acquisition of WellChoice. Comparable basis information is not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of WellPoint had the acquisition been completed as of January 1, 2005. Comparable basis information for the year ended December 31, 2005 was calculated by adding the reclassified historical statements of income for WellPoint and WellChoice and includes no intercompany eliminations or pro forma adjustments.

Operating gain (loss) is defined as operating revenue less benefit expense, selling expense, general and administrative expense and cost of drugs. Premiums increased $11.3 billion, or 28%, to $52.0 billion in 2006. On a comparable basis, premiums increased $5.4 billion, or 12%, primarily due to premium rate increases across all customer types, the addition of the New York state prescription drug contract and new enrollment in our Medicare Part D products. Administrative fees increased $790.4 million, or 29%, to $3.5 billion in 2006. On a comparable basis, administrative fees increased $184.6 million, or 6%, primarily due to self-funded membership growth in National Accounts, including BlueCard, and rate increases in Large Group and National Accounts. Self-funded membership growth was driven by successful efforts to attract large self-funded accounts and was attributable to our network breadth, discounts, service and increased focus on health improvement and wellness, as well as the popularity of the BlueCard program. Other revenue principally includes amounts from mail-order prescription drug sales by our PBM companies, which provide services to members of our Health Care segment and third party clients. Other revenue increased $73.9 million, or 14%, to $593.1 million in 2006. On a comparable basis, other revenue increased $74.9 million, or 14%, primarily due to revenue generated by growth in mail-order prescription revenue from both our Health Care segment and third parties. Increased mail-order prescription volume resulted from additional utilization of our PBM companies’ mail-order pharmacy option with the introduction of Medicare Part D. Net investment income increased $245.6 million, or 39%, to $878.7 million in 2006 primarily resulting from invested assets acquired with the acquisition of WellChoice, growth in invested assets from reinvestment of cash generated from operations and higher interest rates. This growth was partially offset by the use of cash for repurchases of our common stock. 50 Table of Contents A summary of our net realized gains (losses) on investments for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 is as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2006 2005 $ Change (In millions) Net realized losses from the sale of fixed maturity securities $ (47.9 ) $ (25.3 ) $ (22.6 ) Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities 98.5 22.0 76.5 Other-than-temporary impairments—credit related (32.5 ) (14.8 ) (17.7 ) Other-than-temporary impairments—interest rate related (23.7 ) — (23.7 ) Other realized gains 5.3 7.9 (2.6 ) Net realized losses $ (0.3 ) $ (10.2 ) $ 9.9 Net realized losses in 2006 primarily related to other-than-temporary impairments of investments and the sale of fixed maturity securities at a loss due to the restructuring of the combined portfolio after our acquisition of WellChoice at the end of 2005. Other-than-temporary impairments—credit related were primarily due to the length of time that equity securities’ fair value was below their cost basis. Other-than-temporary impairments—interest related were primarily due to the prevailing interest rate environment and our intent to hold fixed maturity securities until their anticipated recovery. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in this MD&A for a discussion of our investment impairment review process. These losses were partially offset by realized gains on the sale of equity securities during 2006. Net realized losses in 2005 primarily related to net realized losses on sales of fixed maturity securities due to the restructuring of the combined portfolio after our merger with WHN at the end of 2004 and credit-related other-than-temporary impairments of equity and fixed maturity securities. These realized losses were partially offset by net realized gains on sales of equity securities and other invested assets. Benefit expense increased $9.6 billion, or 29%, to $42.2 billion in 2006. On a comparable basis, benefit expense increased $4.5 billion, or 12%, primarily due to increased cost of care, which was driven by higher costs in outpatient and inpatient services, the addition of the New York State prescription drug contract and benefit expense for our Medicare Part D products. On a comparable basis, our benefit expense ratio increased 20 basis points to 81.2% in 2006. This increase was primarily related to a change in business mix, primarily driven by the addition of the New York State prescription drug contract, growth in FEP and State Sponsored business, as well as the introduction of Medicare Part D. All of these products have a higher benefit expense ratio than the WellPoint average. These increases were partially offset by disciplined pricing and the non-recurrence of $35.0 million of benefit expense recorded in the second quarter of 2005 related to the multi-district litigation settlement agreement, or MDL settlement agreement, discussed in Significant Transactions within this MD&A. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $1.5 billion, or 21%, to $8.8 billion in 2006. On a comparable basis, selling, general and administrative expense increased $498.1 million, or 6%. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to increases in volume-sensitive costs such as commissions, premium taxes and other expenses associated with growth in our business, as well as additional share-based compensation expense resulting from our January 1, 2006 adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, or FAS 123R. See Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this Form 10-K. On a comparable basis, our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 80 basis points to 15.7% in 2006, primarily due to growth in premium income, continued expense control and further leveraging of general and administrative costs over a larger membership base. In addition, the 2005 selling, general and administrative expense ratio was negatively impacted by $68.0 million, or 10 basis points, related to the MDL settlement agreement. 51 Table of Contents Cost of drugs increased $13.2 million, or 5%, to $301.2 million in 2006. This increase is primarily attributable to increased mail-order prescription volume by our PBM companies, partially offset by higher utilization of generic prescription drugs. Interest expense increased $177.3 million, or 78%, to $403.5 million in 2006, primarily due to additional interest expense on the debt incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of WellChoice. Amortization of other intangible assets increased $58.5 million, or 24%, to $297.4 million in 2006, primarily due to additional amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets with finite lives resulting from the acquisition of WellChoice. Income tax expense increased $393.0 million, or 28%, to $1.8 billion in 2006, consistent with the increase in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate in 2006 and 2005 was 37.0% and 36.7%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2006 was primarily related to increases in state taxes due to the addition of operations in New York following the acquisition of WellChoice. Reportable Segments We use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, as described in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Through December 31, 2006, our reportable segments were Health Care, Specialty and Other. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, selling, general and administrative expense and cost of drugs. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. For additional information, see Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. The discussions of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Health Care Our Health Care segment’s summarized results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are as follows: Year Ended December 31 ComparableBasis Year EndedDecember 31, 2005 2006 2005 % Change $ Change % Change (In millions) Operating revenue $ 53,860.6 $ 41,867.0 29 % $ 48,159.6 $ 5,701.0 12 % Operating gain $ 4,288.3 $ 3,418.0 25 % $ 3,789.6 $ 498.7 13 % Operating margin 8.0 % 8.2 % (20 )bp 7.9 % 10 bp Operating revenue increased $12.0 billion, or 29%, to $53.9 billion in 2006. On a comparable basis, operating revenue increased $5.7 billion, or 12%, primarily due to premium rate increases across all customer types, the addition of the New York state prescription drug contract and our Medicare Part D products. Operating gain increased $870.3 million, or 25%, to $4.3 billion in 2006. On a comparable basis, operating gain increased $498.7 million, or 13%, primarily due to disciplined pricing across all lines of business and continued expense control, the non-recurrence of $103.0 million in benefit and general and administrative expense related to the MDL settlement agreement, as well as the addition of the New York state prescription drug 52 Table of Contents contract and Medicare Part D. These increases were partially offset by the impact of increased share-based compensation expense following the adoption of FAS 123R in 2006. The operating margin decreased by 20 basis points from 8.2% in 2005 to 8.0% in 2006. On a comparable basis, operating margin increased 10 basis points in 2006. The 2006 operating margin was impacted by 30 basis points related to increased share-based compensation following the adoption of FAS 123R, as well as 20 basis points related to a business mix shift, including the addition of lower margin governmental business. The 2005 operating margin included a 20 basis point impact related to the MDL settlement agreement. Specialty Our Specialty segment’s summarized results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 ComparableBasis Year EndedDecember 31, 2005 2006 2005 % Change $ Change % Change (In millions) Operating revenue $ 3,566.2 $ 3,066.1 16 % $ 3,098.2 $ 468.0 15 % Operating gain $ 523.6 $ 426.4 23 % $ 426.9 $ 96.7 23 % Operating margin 14.7 % 13.9 % 80 bp 13.8 % 90 bp Operating revenue increased $500.1 million, or 16%, to $3.6 billion in 2006. On a comparable basis, operating revenue increased $468.0 million, or 15%, primarily due to increased prescription volume by our PBM companies, including specialty pharmacy, driven by the addition of Medicare Part D, partially offset by the sale of our workers compensation business in Wisconsin in 2005. Operating gain increased $97.2 million, or 23%, to $523.6 million in 2006. On a comparable basis, operating gain increased $96.7 million, or 23%, primarily due to increased prescription volume by our PBM companies, as well as a change in estimate in noncurrent reserves for future policy benefits following the change of experience factors for waiver of premium reserves based on the recently released group term life mortality study. These increases were partially offset by the sale of our workers compensation business in Wisconsin in 2005. Operating margin increased 80 basis points from 13.9% in 2005 to 14.7% in 2006. On a comparable basis, operating margin increased 90 basis points in 2006, primarily due to the change in estimate in reserves mentioned in the preceding paragraph, as well as increased prescription volume and higher utilization of generic prescription drugs in our mail-order PBM companies. Other Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 ComparableBasis Year EndedDecember 31,2005 2006 2005 % Change $ Change % Change (In millions) Operating revenue from external customers $ 454.6 $ 333.6 36 % $ 464.8 $ (10.2 ) (2 )% Elimination of intersegment revenue (1,806.8 ) (1,348.3 ) 34 % (1,348.3 ) (458.5 ) 34 % Total operating revenue $ (1,352.2 ) $ (1,014.7 ) 33 % $ (883.5 ) $ (468.7 ) 53 % Operating loss $ (75.0 ) $ (111.9 ) (33 )% $ (125.8 ) $ 50.8 (40 )% 53 Table of Contents Operating revenue from external customers increased $121.0 million, or 36%, to $454.6 million in 2006. On a comparable basis, operating revenue from external customers decreased $10.2 million, or 2%. On both a reported and comparable basis, the elimination of intersegment revenue increased $458.5 million, or 34%, in 2006, reflecting additional sales by our PBM companies of Medicare Part D and specialty pharmacy products to our Health Care segment. Operating loss decreased $36.9 million, or 33%, to $75.0 million in 2006. On a comparable basis, operating loss decreased $50.8 million, or 40%, primarily due to lower expenses related to retention bonuses and other compensation costs associated with the merger between the former Anthem, Inc. and the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc.

Medical membership is shown net of overlapping BlueCard host membership. 3 WellPoint without WellChoice membership was calculated by subtracting membership resulting from the WellChoice acquisition from WellPoint, Inc.’s reported membership at December 31, 2005. 4 Represents annual PBM prescription volume for mail order and retail prescriptions for the full years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. 5 Changes from prior period information are not meaningful due to different counting methodologies used by the former Anthem, Inc. and the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, total medical membership increased approximately 6,128,000, or 22%, primarily due to our acquisition of WellChoice and organic growth in all customer types. Excluding the impact of the WellChoice acquisition: BlueCard membership increased 545,000, or 16%, representing membership growth in other Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees with members who reside in or travel to our licensed areas; National Accounts membership increased 329,000, or 10%, primarily due to new sales, as well as in-group increases in membership and members acquired from the acquisition of Lumenos; Large Group membership increased 204,000, or 2% primarily due to our acquisition of Lumenos as well as new sales throughout the year; State Sponsored membership increased 148,000, or 9% due to new sales, primarily in the West region; and ISG membership increased 97,000, or 2%, primarily due to the introduction of new, more affordable product designs and an overall increase in consumer awareness of our wide variety of quality products and services as well as efforts to market products to the uninsured. Self-funded medical membership increased 3,282,000 or 25%, primarily due to our merger with WellChoice and increases in our BlueCard, National Accounts and Large Group businesses. Fully-insured membership increased by 2,846,000 or 20%, due to our merger with WellChoice. However, on a comparable basis, fully-insured membership decreased by 62,000 primarily due to a Large Group fully-insured account in the East region, which represented approximately 140,000 medical members, converting to self-funded during the third quarter of 2005. This was partially offset by growth in our ISG and State Sponsored businesses, as well as new sales and positive in-group change in Large Group. Our specialty metrics are derived from membership and activity from our specialty products. These products are often ancillary to our health business, and can therefore be impacted by growth in our medical membership. Prescription volume at our PBM increased 8,080,000 prescriptions, or 2%, in 2005 primarily due to growth in both our mail order and retail operations. 55 Table of Contents VIII. Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are discussed in the following section.

We discuss our 2005 and 2004 operations using “comparable basis” information, which is presented to provide a more meaningful 2004 comparison to 2005, due to the merger with WHN. Comparable basis information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of WellPoint, Inc. had the merger been completed as of January 1, 2004. Comparable basis information for the year ended December 31, 2004 was calculated by adding the reclassified historical statements of income for the former WHN for the 11 months ended November 30, 2004 to the reported results of WellPoint, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2004, which includes one month of the former WHN. Comparable basis information contains no intercompany eliminations or pro forma adjustments.

On a comparable basis, premium increased $2.6 billion, or 7%, primarily due to premium rate increases in our Large Group, ISG and Senior businesses and membership gains in our ISG, State Sponsored and Senior membership types. Partially offsetting the impact of premium rate increases was the conversion of some Large Group customers from fully-insured contracts to self-funded arrangements and the non-renewal of certain fully-insured accounts. Administrative fees increased $1.3 billion, or 87%, to $2.7 billion in 2005. On a comparable basis, administrative fees increased $226.2 million, or 9%, primarily due to increased self-funded membership in our National and Large Group businesses. These membership gains are driven by the popularity of the BlueCard program, as well as successful efforts to attract large self-funded accounts and the continuing trend towards self-funded arrangements over fully-insured contracts among our Large Group customers. Other revenue principally includes amounts from mail-order drug sales by our PBM companies, which provides services to members of our Health Care segment and third party clients. Other revenue increased $300.8 million, or 138%, to $519.2 million in 2005. On a comparable basis, other revenue increased $30.0 million, or 6%, primarily due to additional mail-order prescription revenue and increased prices of prescription drugs sold by our PBM companies. Increased mail-order prescription volume resulted from both membership increases and additional utilization of our PBM’s mail-order pharmacy option. Net investment income increased $321.4 million, or 103%, to $633.1 million in 2005 primarily resulting from invested assets acquired with the WHN merger (net of cash used in the merger) and from growth in invested assets from reinvestment of cash generated from operations. A summary of our net realized (losses) gains on investments for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 is as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 2005 2004 $ Change (In millions) Net realized (losses) gains from the sale of fixed maturity securities $ (25.3 ) $ 40.6 $ (65.9 ) Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities 22.0 3.3 18.7 Other-than-temporary impairments—credit related (14.8 ) (0.8 ) (14.0 ) Other realized gains (losses) 7.9 (0.6 ) 8.5 Net realized (losses) gains $ (10.2 ) $ 42.5 $ (52.7 ) 58 Table of Contents In 2005, net realized gains and losses from the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities were primarily due to restructuring of our portfolio as a result of integration activities related to our merger with WHN. During 2004, we reallocated securities in our fixed maturity portfolio, primarily to optimize future after-tax income by investing in a higher mix of tax-exempt fixed maturity securities. The sale of fixed maturity securities associated with this reallocation resulted in the majority of the net realized gains reported during the year ended December 31, 2004. Net gains or losses on investments are influenced by market conditions when an investment is sold, and will vary from year to year. Other-than-temporary impairments in 2005 were approximately equal between equity securities and fixed maturity securities, while in 2004, other-than-temporary impairments were substantially related to equity securities. Other-than-temporary impairments in both 2005 and 2004 are primarily due to the length of time that such securities’ fair value had been less than cost. Benefit expense increased $17.3 billion, or 114%, to $32.6 billion in 2005. On a comparable basis, benefit expense increased $1.9 billion, or 6%, primarily due to increased cost of care, which was driven primarily by higher costs in outpatient and inpatient services. In addition, our benefit expense included $35.0 million in 2005 related to the MDL settlement agreement discussed in Significant Transactions within this MD&A. On a comparable basis, our benefit expense ratio decreased 60 basis points from 80.8% in 2004 to 80.2% in 2005. The decrease in our benefit expense ratio is driven by moderating cost of care trends coupled with disciplined underwriting practices. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $3.8 billion, or 109%, to $7.3 billion in 2005. On a comparable basis, selling, general and administrative expense increased $435.4 million, or 6%, primarily due to increases in volume-sensitive costs such as higher commissions, premium taxes and other expenses associated with growth in our business; increased incentive compensation, including merger-related stay bonuses; and costs associated with the transition of information technology infrastructure services to IBM. In addition, we incurred expenses related to the MDL settlement agreement and start-up costs related to Medicare Part D. On a comparable basis, our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 10 basis points to 16.6% in 2005, primarily due to growth in operating revenue and the leveraging of costs over a larger membership base, partially offset by the factors noted above. Cost of drugs increased $193.0 million, or 203%, to $288.0 million in 2005. On a comparable basis cost of drugs increased $18.2 million, or 7%, primarily due to higher mail-order prescription volume at our PBM companies. Interest expense increased $83.9 million, or 59%, to $226.2 million in 2005, primarily due to additional interest expense on the debt incurred in conjunction with the WHN merger, partially offset by reduced interest expense from the repurchase of debt securities in December of 2004. Amortization of other intangible assets increased $177.5 million, or 289%, to $238.9 million in 2005, primarily due to a full year of additional amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets with finite lives resulting from the WHN merger. Income tax expense increased $943.3 million, or 195%, to $1,426.5 million in 2005. Included in 2005 was $28.4 million in tax benefits associated with a refund claim recognizing the deductibility of capital losses on the sale of certain subsidiaries that occurred in prior years. Included in 2004 was $44.8 million in tax benefits associated with a change in Indiana laws governing the state’s high-risk health insurance pool. Our net income as a percentage of total revenue increased 90 basis points, from 4.6% in 2004 to 5.5% in 2005. The increase in this metric reflects a combination of all factors discussed above. 59 Table of Contents The discussion of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Health Care Our Health Care segment’s summarized results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows: Year Ended December 31 % Change ComparableBasis Year EndedDecember 31, 2004 $ Change % Change 2005 2004 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 41,867.0 $ 19,427.7 116 % $ 38,982.2 $ 2,884.8 7 % Operating gain $ 3,418.0 $ 1,497.4 128 % $ 2,995.9 $ 422.1 14 % Operating margin 8.2 % 7.7 % 50 bp 7.7 % 50 bp Operating revenue increased $22.4 billion, or 116%, to $41.9 billion. On a comparable basis, operating revenue increased $2.9 billion, or 7%, primarily due to growth in premium income as a result of premium rate increases in our Large Group and ISG businesses resulting from underwriting discipline. Also contributing to premium revenue growth was higher membership, primarily in our ISG and State Sponsored businesses. Administrative fees also increased primarily due to additional self-funded membership in National Accounts and Large Group businesses. Operating gain increased $1.9 billion, or 128%, to $3.4 billion. On a comparable basis, operating gain increased $422.1 million, or 14%, primarily due to premium rate increases mentioned above along with membership growth and lower than expected cost of care within our ISG, Senior and Large Group businesses. Partially offsetting this increase was the impact of the $103.0 million pre-tax expense recognized in connection with the MDL settlement agreement in 2005. Specialty Our Specialty segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 % Change ComparableBasis Year EndedDecember 31, 2004 $ Change % Change 2005 2004 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 3,066.1 $ 1,447.0 112 % $ 2,846.0 $ 220.1 8 % Operating gain $ 426.4 $ 105.2 305 % $ 337.2 $ 89.2 26 % Operating margin 13.9 % 7.3 % 660 bp 11.8 % 210 bp Operating revenue increased $1.6 billion, or 112%, to $3.1 billion. On a comparable basis, operating revenue increased $220.1 million, or 8%, primarily due to increases in PBM operating revenue driven by improved pharmaceutical contracting and increased script volume, particularly mail-order script volume. This increase was partially offset by decreases in behavioral health revenue due to the standardization in funding arrangements between Health Care and Specialty segments. Operating gain increased $321.2 million, or 305%, to $426.4 million. On a comparable basis, operating gain increased $89.2 million or 26%, primarily due to an increase in PBM, behavioral health and dental businesses. 60 Table of Contents On a comparable basis, PBM operating gain increased due to higher script volume and improved pharmaceutical contracting. In addition, operating gain from behavioral health increased as we standardized funding arrangements between the Health Care and Specialty segments. Finally, membership growth, driven primarily by the transition of 1.9 million behavioral health members from an outside vendor, also contributed to the improved results in Specialty segment. These gains are partially offset by decreased rates on workers’ compensation insurance in California driven by unfavorable legislation. Other Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 % Change ComparableBasis YearEndedDecember 31, 2004 $ Change % Change 2005 2004 (In millions) Operating revenue from external customers $ 333.6 $ 208.6 60 % $ 315.9 $ 17.7 6 % Elimination of intersegment revenue (1,348.3 ) (729.6 ) 85 % (1,111.6 ) (236.7 ) 21 % Total operating revenue $ (1,014.7 ) $ (521.0 ) 95 % $ (795.7 ) $ (219.0 ) 28 % Operating loss $ (111.9 ) $ (102.2 ) 9 % $ (138.7 ) $ 26.8 (19 )% Operating revenue from external customers increased $125.0 million, or 60%, to $333.6 million. On a comparable basis, operating revenue from external customers increased $17.7 million, or 6%. The elimination of intersegment revenue increased $618.7 million, or 85%. On a comparable basis, the elimination of intersegment revenue increased $236.7 million, or 21%, reflecting additional sales by our PBM companies to our Health Care segment. Operating loss increased $9.7 million, or 9%, to $111.9 million. On a comparable basis, operating loss decreased $26.8 million or 19%, primarily due to expenses not allocated to the Health Care or Specialty segments. IX. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider some of our most important accounting policies that require estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this Form 10-K. Medical Claims Payable The most judgmental accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2006, this liability was $5.3 billion and represented 19% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an 61 Table of Contents estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 95%, or $5.1 billion, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2006; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 5%, or $239.3 million, of the total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2006. The level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period end to the next, from 1% to 5% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made. Liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical data of paid claims is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months (generally the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or “trend factors”. Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison of prior year, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated, rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense. In addition to incurred but not paid claims, the liability for medical claims payable includes reserves for premium deficiencies, if appropriate. Premium deficiencies are recognized when it is probable that expected claims and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums on existing medical insurance contracts without consideration of investment income. Determination of premium deficiencies for longer duration life and disability contracts, which are reported with reserves for future policy benefits, includes consideration of investment income. For purposes of premium deficiencies, contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. We regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to 62 Table of Contents claim liabilities occur each quarter and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that quarter. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable. While there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid liability as of December 31, 2006 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by other operational variables including system changes, provider submission patterns and business combinations. There is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through 12 months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. At December 31, 2006, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 20 and 70 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower variability ranging from 10 to 20 basis points. Over the period from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006, completion factors have increased. With consideration of claim payments through December 31, 2006, the completion factors used to determine the incurred but not paid claim liability estimate for the December 31, 2005 valuation period have developed higher than those used at December 31, 2005, primarily because we are receiving claims information from our providers more timely as a result of increased electronic submissions. In addition, we are paying claims more quickly once they have been received. This resulted in approximately $113.6 million of redundancy in the December 31, 2005 estimate and is included in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. This continued increase has been taken into consideration when determining the completion factors used in establishing the December 31, 2006 incurred but not paid claim liability by choosing factors that reflect the more recent experience. The difference in completion factor assumptions, assuming moderately adverse experience, results in variability of 2%, or approximately $101.0 million, in the December 31, 2006 incurred but not paid claim liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein. Over the period from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005, completion factors increased. With consideration of claims payment through December 31, 2005, the completion factors used to determine the incurred but not paid claim liability estimate for the December 31, 2004 valuation period have developed higher than those used at December 31, 2004, primarily because we are receiving claims information from our providers more timely as a result of increased electronic submissions. This resulted in approximately $194.3 million of redundancy in the December 31, 2004 estimate and included in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2005. In 2003, results presented represent the former Anthem, Inc. on a stand alone basis. Due to the acquisition of WHN at the end of 2004, these periods are not on a comparable basis. Therefore, changes in assumptions from 2003 to 2004 are not meaningful in comparing these periods. The other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2006 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors used in determining the claims expense per member per month for the most recent two incurral months. At December 31, 2006, there was a 740 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors assuming moderately adverse experience. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 10%, or approximately $504.0 million, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factor used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken 63 Table of Contents into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claim liability at December 31, 2006. As we look at the year-over-year claim trend for the prior period (November and December 2005) compared to the current period (November and December 2006), the trend used in our reserve models have increased moderately due to mix changes resulting from the introduction of Part D drug plans and other product changes. However, claim trends observed as of December 31, 2005 based upon subsequent claim runout were lower than anticipated in the assumptions used to estimate medical claims payable at December 31, 2005. This decline was due to moderating outpatient service trends and declines in pharmacy benefit cost trend. This difference between the trends assumed in establishing the December 31, 2005 medical claims payable, and the trend observed based upon subsequent claims runout through the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, resulted in approximately $504.1 million of redundancy in the December 31, 2005 estimate and included in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Over the period from 2004 to 2005, claim trends declined. Claim trends observed based upon subsequent claim runout were lower than anticipated in the assumptions used to estimate medical claims payable at December 31, 2004. This decline was due to moderating outpatient service trends and declines in pharmacy benefit cost trend. This difference between the trends assumed in establishing the December 31, 2004 medical claims payable, and the trend observed based upon subsequent claims runout, resulted in approximately $450.6 million of redundancy in the December 31, 2004 estimate and included in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2005. As summarized below, Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides historical information regarding the accrual and payment of our medical claims liability. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements, the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years (redundancies)” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years (redundancies)” claims may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year”. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. We believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for unpaid claims liability at each reporting date. 64 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is as follows: Years Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Gross medical claims payable, beginning of period $ 4,853.4 $ 4,134.0 $ 1,836.0 Ceded medical claims payable, beginning of period (27.7 ) (31.9 ) (8.7 ) Net medical claims payable, beginning of period 4,825.7 4,102.1 1,827.3 Business combinations and purchase adjustments (6.4 ) 784.5 2,331.0 Net incurred medical claims: Current year 42,613.2 32,865.6 15,344.9 Prior years (redundancies) (617.7 ) (644.9 ) (171.9 ) Total net incurred medical claims 41,995.5 32,220.7 15,173.0 Net payments attributable to: Current year medical claims 37,486.0 28,997.1 12,453.2 Prior years medical claims 4,089.5 3,284.5 2,776.0 Total net payments 41,575.5 32,281.6 15,229.2 Net medical claims payable, end of period 5,239.3 4,825.7 4,102.1 Ceded medical claims payable, end of period 51.0 27.7 31.9 Gross medical claims payable, end of period $ 5,290.3 $ 4,853.4 $ 4,134.0 Current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net incurred medical claims 88.0 % 88.2 % 81.2 % Prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net medical claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current period 14.7 % 18.7 % 10.4 % Prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims 1.9 % 4.2 % 1.4 % Amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled. Liabilities at any period end are continually reviewed and re-estimated as information regarding actual claims payments, or runout, becomes known. This information is compared to the originally established year end liability. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated. The prior year redundancy of $617.7 million shown above for the year ended December 31, 2006 represents an estimate based on paid claim activity from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006. Medical claim liabilities are usually described as having a “short tail”, which means that they are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the majority, or approximately 82%, of the $617.7 million redundancy relates to claims incurred in calendar year 2005, with the remaining 18% related to claims incurred in 2004 and prior. The ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 88.0% for 2006, 88.2% for 2005 and 81.2% for 2004. The 2004 ratio was impacted by having only one month of medical claims incurred and paid during 2004 for the former WHN. If the former WHN had not been included during 2004, current year medical claims payments would have been $12,057.7 million, current year net incurred medical claims would have been $13,835.1 million and the adjusted ratio would have been approximately 87.2% for 2004. Comparison of the 2006 ratio of 88.0% and the 2005 ratio of 88.2% reflect a moderate decline due to system conversions and integration activity that impacted the 2006 ratio. Comparison of the 2005 ratio of 88.2% and the adjusted 2004 ratio of 87.2% indicate that we paid claims faster between those periods. The increase was primarily attributable to improved processes and our provider networks submitting claims information to us more timely as a result of increased electronic submissions. The result of these changes is an enhanced ability to adjudicate and pay claims more quickly. 65 Table of Contents We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current period in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. This metric was 14.7% for 2006, 18.7% for 2005 and 10.4% for 2004. As discussed previously, the 400 basis point decrease in this metric for 2006 was caused by actual completion factors and claim trends differing from the assumptions used to support our best estimate of the incurred but not paid claim liability of the prior period. We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation indicates the reasonableness of our prior year estimation of incurred medical claims and the consistency of our methodology. This metric was 1.9% for 2006, 4.2% for 2005 and 1.4% for 2004. This ratio is calculated using the redundancy of $617.7 million, shown above, which represents an estimate based on paid claim activity from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006. The 2006 ratio is impacted by having no net incurred medical claims for the former WellChoice, Inc. in 2005. If the former Wellchoice, Inc. had been included for the full year 2005, this ratio would have been approximately 1.6%. The 2005 ratio is impacted by having only one month of net incurred medical claims for WHN in 2004. If WHN had been included for the full year 2004, estimated prior year net incurred medical claims would have been $30,819.1 million, and the adjusted ratio would have been approximately 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in the above table for each of 2005 and 2004 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims—current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims—prior years (redundancies)” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 2005 2004 (In millions) Total net incurred medical claims, as reported $ 32,220.7 $ 15,173.0 Retrospective basis, as described above 32,247.9 14,700.0 Variance $ (27.2 ) $ 473.0 Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported (0.1 )% 3.1 % Given that our business is primarily short tailed, the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2006 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2007. The 2005 variance of $(27.2) million and variance to total incurred medical claims, as reported of (0.1)% are impacted by having no WellChoice, Inc. activity in the total incurred as reported during 2005 and full development of activity from the former WellChoice, Inc. in the retrospective basis amount. The adjusted variance would be approximately $(175.2) million and the variance to total incurred would be approximately (0.5)% if the impact of WellChoice is removed. The 2004 variance of $473.0 million and variance to total incurred medical claims, as reported of 3.1% are impacted by having only one month of total incurred as reported for WHN during 2004 and a full development of WHN activity in the retrospective basis amount. The adjusted variance would be approximately $136.5 million and the variance to total incurred would be approximately 1.0% if the impact of WHN is removed. These small variances to total net incurred medical claims, adjusted for the impacts of WellChoice, Inc. and WHN, shows that our estimates of this liability have approximated the actual experience for the years depicted. 66 Table of Contents Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This standard requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance. At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following: • the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset; • the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim; • the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and • any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences. During 2006 the valuation allowance increased by $0.5 million. This resulted from realized and unrealized capital losses of subsidiaries, which are not included in our consolidated tax return. During 2004 and 2003, the valuation allowance decreased by $33.8 million and $81.9 million, respectively. The 2004 and 2003 reductions resulted from utilizing alternative minimum tax, or AMT, credits and net operating losses on our federal income tax return for which we had a deferred tax asset with a corresponding valuation allowance. As deferred tax assets related to those deductions are available for use in the tax return, a valuation was no longer required and was reduced. The decrease in the valuation allowance in 2004 was partially offset by an additional $5.6 million related to Indiana state taxes, as discussed below. During 2004 and 2003, we recorded additional tax liabilities of $44.1 million and $81.9 million, respectively, offsetting the reduction in valuation allowances discussed above. These additional liabilities were recorded for uncertainty on several tax issues, including the lack of clear guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, on various tax issues relating to our conversion in 1986 from tax-exempt to tax-paying status. During the third quarter of 2006, we decreased our state deferred tax liability by $43.0 million, resulting in a tax benefit, net of federal taxes, of $28.0 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006. This resulted from a lower effective tax rate due to changes in our state apportionment factors following the WellChoice acquisition. During 2005, a refund claim we filed in 2003 was approved by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. The claim related to initially disallowed losses on the sale of certain subsidiaries in the late 1990s. A tax benefit of $28.4 million related to this claim was recorded in the first quarter of 2005. Net income related to this claim was $0.04 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2005. As a result of legislation enacted in Indiana on March 16, 2004, we recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities, with a corresponding net tax benefit in our income statement of $44.8 million, or $0.15 per basic share and $0.14 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2004. The legislation eliminated the creation of tax credits resulting from the payment of future assessments to the Indiana Comprehensive Health Insurance Association, or ICHIA. ICHIA is Indiana’s high-risk health insurance pool. Our historical ICHIA assessment payments far exceeded our Indiana income tax liability. Thus, the recognition of a state deferred tax asset was not warranted, as a future Indiana tax liability was unlikely. Under the new legislation, ICHIA tax credits are limited to any unused ICHIA assessment paid prior to December 31, 2004. FAS 109 requires that deferred assets or liabilities be established in the period a change in law is enacted. These deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect 67 Table of Contents temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits relating to our Indiana income tax filings. Following guidance in FAS 109, a valuation allowance of $5.6 million was established for the portion of the deferred tax asset, which we believe will likely not be utilized. There is no carryforward limitation on the tax credits and the net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2018. We believe we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to offset these carryforwards; therefore, no additional valuation allowance was recorded. We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional tax liability for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for tax exposures. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted. In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and state authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intend to defend our positions vigorously through the IRS appeals process. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact to earnings from these matters. As of December 31, 2006, the IRS was nearing completion of its examination of our 2003 tax year. The IRS will continue auditing our 2004 tax year and will initiate a review of the 2005 and 2006 tax years during 2007. In addition, the IRS has invited us to join the Compliance Assurance Program, or CAP, for 2007. The objective of CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the IRS of the accuracy of tax returns prior to filing, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations. Various tax examinations and proceedings also continue for certain subsidiaries for tax years prior to being included in our consolidated tax return. For additional information, see Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this Form 10-K. See also New Accounting Pronouncements disclosure included in this Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates section of our MD&A for discussion of new accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2006 was $13.4 billion and other intangible assets were $9.4 billion. The sum of goodwill and intangible assets represents 44% of our total consolidated assets and 93% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2006. We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and Statement of Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FAS 141 specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under FAS 142, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. We completed our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) for each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 and based upon these tests we have not incurred any impairment losses related to any goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives). On December 28, 2005, we purchased 100% of the outstanding common stock of WellChoice, Inc. In accordance with FAS 141, we allocated the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed. This allocation process included the review of relevant information 68 Table of Contents about the assets and liabilities, independent appraisals and other valuations to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation resulted in $3.5 billion of non-tax deductible goodwill and $1.7 billion of identifiable intangible assets. On November 30, 2004, we completed our merger with WHN and purchased 100% of the outstanding common stock of WHN. In accordance with FAS 141, we allocated the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed. This allocation process included the review of relevant information about the assets and liabilities, independent appraisals and other valuations to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation resulted in $7.6 billion of non-tax deductible goodwill and $7.0 billion of identifiable intangible assets. While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, the annual impairment testing required under FAS 142 requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our goodwill and intangibles. Such assumptions include the discount factor used to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, which is ultimately used to identify potential goodwill impairment. Such estimated fair values might produce significantly different results if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If we are unable to support a fair value estimate in future annual goodwill impairment tests or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income. For additional information, see Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this Form 10-K. Investments Current and long term available-for-sale investment securities were $17.5 billion at December 31, 2006 and represented 34% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2006. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, our fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as “available-for-sale” securities and are reported at fair value. We classify our investments in available-for-sale fixed maturity securities as either current or noncurrent assets based on their contractual maturity. Investment income is recorded when earned, and realized gains or losses, determined by specific identification of investments sold, are included in income when the securities are sold. WellPoint maintains various rabbi trusts to account for the assets and liabilities under certain deferred compensation plans. Under these plans, the participants can defer certain types of compensation and elect to receive a return on the deferred amounts based on the changes in fair value of various investment options, primarily a variety of mutual funds. Rabbi trust assets were previously classified as noncurrent available-for-sale investments. Effective January 1, 2006 and in connection with a restructuring of the plans, WellPoint changed its classification for the majority of such securities from available-for-sale to trading, which are reported in “Other invested assets, current” in the consolidated balance sheet. The change in the fair value of the trading portfolio rabbi trust assets during 2006 resulted in $35.6 million of realized gains, which, together with net investment income from trading portfolio rabbi trust assets of $8.6 million, is classified in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income, consistent with the related increase in compensation expense. During December 2006, WellPoint initiated a program whereby it generally purchases corporate-owned life insurance policies on participants in the deferred compensation plans. The cash surrender value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies is reported in “Other invested assets, long-term” in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in cash surrender value is reported as an offset to premium expense classified as general and administrative expense. In addition to available-for-sale investment securities, we held other long-term investments of $628.8 million, or 1% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2006. These long-term investments consist primarily 69 Table of Contents of real estate, cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and certain other investments. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term. An impairment review of securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We evaluate our investment securities on a quarterly basis, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. If any declines are determined to be other-than-temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made. We have a committee made up of certain accounting and investment associates and management responsible for managing the impairment review process. The current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. We recorded charges for other-than-temporary impairment of securities of $56.2 million, $14.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The $56.2 million impairment for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily related to our intent to hold fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position due to the prevailing interest rate environment, as well as other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities that had been in an unrealized loss position for an extended period of time. Impairments recorded in 2005 and 2004 were primarily the result of the continued credit deterioration on specific issuers in the bond and equity markets. We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. This could result in realized losses relating to other-than-temporary declines being charged against future income. A summary of available-for-sale investments with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2006 along with the related fair value, aggregated by the length of time that investments have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, is as follows: Less than Twelve Months Twelve Months or More Total FairValue GrossUnrealizedLosses FairValue GrossUnrealizedLosses FairValue GrossUnrealizedLosses (In millions) Fixed maturity securities $ 3,884.1 $ (28.8 ) $ 5,306.4 $ (103.3 ) $ 9,190.5 $ (132.1 ) Equity securities 234.6 (15.3 ) 21.0 (0.6 ) 255.6 (15.9 ) Total $ 4,118.7 $ (44.1 ) $ 5,327.4 $ (103.9 ) $ 9,446.1 $ (148.0 ) Our fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, which impact the fair value of individual securities. Unrealized losses reported above were primarily caused by the effect of a rising interest rate environment on certain securities with stated interest rates currently below market rates. We currently have the ability and intent to hold these securities until their full cost can be recovered. Therefore, we do not believe the unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment as of December 31, 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we sold $5.9 billion of fixed maturity and equity securities resulting in gross realized losses of $95.7 million. Subsequent to the acquisition of WellChoice, during 2006, we restructured our investment portfolios to align the merged portfolios with our overall investment guidelines. The majority of the sales of fixed maturity securities resulted in realized losses due to the prevailing interest rate environment. For equity securities, the 2006 sales to restructure the merged portfolios primarily resulted in realized gains. Similarly, subsequent to the merger with WHN, during 2005, we restructured our investment 70 Table of Contents portfolios to align the merged portfolios with our overall investment guidelines. The majority of the sales of fixed maturity securities resulted in realized losses due to the prevailing interest rate environment. For equity securities, the 2005 sales to restructure the merged portfolios primarily resulted in realized gains. A primary objective in the management of the fixed maturity and equity portfolios is to maximize total return relative to underlying liabilities and respective liquidity needs. In achieving this goal, assets may be sold to take advantage of market conditions or other investment opportunities as well as tax considerations. Sales will generally produce realized gains and losses. In the ordinary course of business, we may sell securities at a loss for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the investment environment; (ii) expectation that the fair value could deteriorate further; (iii) desire to reduce our exposure to an issuer or an industry; (iv) changes in credit quality; or (v) changes in expected cash flow. We participate in securities lending programs whereby marketable securities in our investment portfolio are transferred to independent brokers or dealers based on, among other things, their creditworthiness in exchange for collateral initially equal to at least 102% of the value of the securities on loan and is thereafter maintained at a minimum of 100% of the market value of the securities loaned. The market value of the securities on loan to each borrower is monitored daily and the borrower is required to deliver additional collateral if the market value of the collateral falls below 100% of the market value of the securities on loan. The fair value of the collateral amounted to $904.7 million and $1,389.9 million, which represented 103% and 102% of the carrying value at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Under guidance provided in FAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, we recognize the collateral as an asset, which is reported as “securities lending collateral” on our balance sheet and we record a corresponding liability for the obligation to return the collateral to the borrower, which is reported as “securities lending payable”. The securities on loan are reported in the applicable investment category on the balance sheet. Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage the market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits of investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future earnings and financial position. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $619.0 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $583.0 million increase in fair value. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $207.1 million. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $207.1 million. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, of this Form 10-K, and Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this Form 10-K. Retirement Benefits Pension Benefits We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our employees, including plans sponsored by the former WellChoice and WHN prior to the related mergers. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FAS 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by FAS 87, we calculate the value of plan assets described below. Further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods. 71 Table of Contents An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our September 30, 2006 measurement date, we selected a long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00% for all plans. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. The expected long-term rate of return is calculated by the geometric averaging method, which calculates an expected multi-period return, reflecting volatility drag on compound returns. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase. The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our September 30, 2006 measurement date. The selected discount rate for all plans is 5.90% (compared to a weighted average discount rate of 5.31% for 2006 expense recognition), which was developed using a yield curve approach. Using yields available on high-quality fixed maturity securities with various maturity dates, the yield curve approach provides a “customized” rate, which is meant to match the expected cash flows of our specific benefit plans. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FAS 87. In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities and equity securities across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in the Company’s expense and cash flow. As of our September 30, 2006 measurement date, we had approximately 67% of plan assets invested in equity securities, 27% in fixed maturity securities and 6% in other assets. No plan assets were invested in WellPoint common stock as of the measurement date. For the year ended December 31, 2006, there were no contributions required under the Employee Retirement Income Securities Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA; however we elected to make discretionary contributions totaling $108.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2006. For the year ending December 31, 2007, we do not expect any required contributions under ERISA; however, we may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. At December 31, 2006, our consolidated net prepaid pension asset was $274.1 million. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recognized consolidated pretax pension expense of $32.6 million, $48.6 million and $40.8 million, respectively. Effective January 1, 2006, we curtailed the benefits under the WellPoint Cash Balance Pension Plan, or the Plan, which name changed from the Anthem Cash Balance Pension Plan effective January 1, 2006. Most participants will no longer have pay credits added to their accounts, but continue to earn interest on existing account balances. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2006, are not eligible to participate in the Plan. Certain participants will be “grandfathered” into the Plan based on age and years of service in previously merged plans. Grandfathered participants continue to receive pay credits under the Plan formula. We recorded a curtailment 72 Table of Contents gain of $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2006. We increased our matching contributions to certain defined contribution plans during 2006 at amounts equal to or greater than the curtailment gain amount. The Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield Cash Balance Pension Plan, or the Empire Plan, was merged into the Plan on December 31, 2006. Effective January 1, 2007, we curtailed the benefits under the Empire Plan. Most participants will no longer have pay credits added to their accounts, but will continue to earn interest on existing account balances. Participants will continue to earn years of service for vesting. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2007 will not be able to participate in the Plan. Certain participants will be “grandfathered” into the Plan based on age and years of service in the Empire Plan. Grandfathered participants will continue to receive pay credits under the Plan formula. There will be no curtailment gain or loss associated with the curtailment of benefits under the Empire Plan. Other Postretirement Benefits We provide most associates with certain life, medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions including a discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits. We recognized a postretirement benefit liability of $554.4 million at December 31, 2006. At our September 30, 2006 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 5.90% (compared to a weighted average discount rate of 5.29% for 2006 expense recognition). We developed this rate using a yield curve approach as described above. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of other benefits at our September 30, 2006 measurement dates was 9.00% for 2007 with a gradual decline to 5.00% by the year 2012. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The health care cost trend assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2006 by $44.3 million and would increase service and interest costs by $2.9 million. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by $38.1 million as of December 31, 2006 and would decrease service and interest costs by $2.6 million. For additional information regarding retirement benefits, see Note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this Form 10-K. See also New Accounting Pronouncements disclosure included in this Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of our MD&A for discussion of new accounting guidance related to retirement benefits. New Accounting Pronouncements We maintain a share-based employee compensation plan. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for the plan under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (“APB 25”). Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123R under the modified prospective method of adoption for which compensation expense related to stock options is recognized on a prospective basis. Also in accordance with the prospective method of adoption, prior period results have not been restated. See Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 12, Capital Stock, to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this Form 10-K. In July 2006, FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (“FIN 48”). Among other things, FIN 48 creates a model to address uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold which all income tax positions must achieve before being recognized in the financial statements. In 73 Table of Contents addition, FIN 48 requires expanded annual disclosures, including a rollforward of the beginning and ending aggregate unrecognized tax benefits as well as specific detail related to tax uncertainties for which it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months. FIN 48 was effective for us on January 1, 2007. Any differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption are generally accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our beginning retained earnings at January 1, 2007. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this Form 10-K. In September 2006, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans – an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (“FAS 158”). FAS 158 retains the previous measurement and disclosure requirements of prior accounting guidance. In addition, FAS 158 requires the recognition of the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet (“recognition provisions”). Furthermore, for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, FAS 158 requires fiscal-year-end measurements of plan assets and benefit obligations, eliminating the use of earlier measurement dates which are currently permissible. The recognition provisions of FAS 158 were effective for us on December 31, 2006. The adoption of FAS 158 decreased our accumulated other comprehensive income by $99.5 million at December 31, 2006. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this Form 10-K. There were no other new accounting pronouncements issued during 2006 that had a material impact on our financial position, operating results or disclosures. X. Liquidity and Capital Resources Introduction Our cash receipts result primarily from premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on long-term borrowings, capital expenditures and repurchases of our common stock. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have some negative impact on our liquidity. We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy. A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities, to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Excess capital at our subsidiaries is paid annually by subsidiaries in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. We have access to a $2.5 billion commercial paper program supported by a $2.5 billion senior credit facility, which allows us to maintain further operating and financial flexibility. 74 Table of Contents Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 During 2006, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $4,044.2 million, compared to $3,135.5 million in 2005, an increase of $908.7 million. This increase resulted from improved premium collections, and higher net income, including the impact of the acquisition of WellChoice, partially offset by higher tax payments. Net cash flow used in investing activities was $457.3 million in 2006, compared to $5,151.6 million of cash used in 2005. The table below outlines the decrease in cash flow used in investing activities of $4,694.3 million between the two periods: Change inCash Used inInvestingActivities (In millions) Decrease in net purchases of investments $ 1,441.8 Decrease in securities lending collateral 1,216.6 Decrease in net purchases of subsidiaries 2,471.5 Increase in net purchases of property and equipment (35.9 ) Increase in other, net (399.7 ) Net decrease in cash used in investing activities $ 4,694.3 The decrease in net purchases of investments resulted from the portfolio restructure in 2005 following the WHN merger, with lower amounts of restructuring in 2006 following the WellChoice acquisition. The decrease in securities lending collateral is consistent with the decrease in amounts outstanding under this program. The offset to the reduction of securities lending collateral is a reduction of securities lending payable, which is reported with cash used in financing activities. The decrease in net purchase of subsidiaries resulted from the WellChoice acquisition in 2005, with no corresponding acquisition during 2006. The increase in other, net includes the purchase of corporate-owned life insurance policies on participants in our deferred compensation plans. Net cash flow used in financing activities was $3,725.0 million in 2006 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $3,299.1 million in 2005. The table below outlines the increase in cash used in financing activities of $7,024.1 million between the two periods: Change inCash Used inFinancingActivities (In millions) Decrease in net proceeds from commercial paper borrowings $ (1,114.2 ) Decrease in net proceeds from long-term borrowings (1,038.8 ) Decrease in securities lending payable (1,216.6 ) Increase in bank overdrafts 293.1 Increase in repurchases of common stock (4,216.8 ) Increase in proceeds from exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan 130.2 Decrease in proceeds from sale of put options and costs related to issuance of common stock 2.5 Increase in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation 136.5 Net increase in cash used in financing activities $ (7,024.1 ) The decrease in net proceeds from commercial paper borrowings reflects repayment of commercial paper following our offering of senior unsecured notes in January 2006 as compared to net issuances of commercial paper in 2005 used to partially fund the WellChoice acquisition. The decrease in net proceeds from long-term borrowings was impacted by issuance of the bridge loan of $1,700.0 in 2005, as compared to 2006 activity including our issuance of senior unsecured notes of $2,700.0 in January 2006, repayment of the bridge loan in January 2006 and scheduled debt maturity of $450.0 in July 2006. 75 Table of Contents On January 10, 2006, we issued $700.0 million of 5.000% notes due 2011; $1,100.0 million of 5.250% notes due 2016; and $900.0 million of 5.850% notes due 2036 under a registration statement filed on December 28, 2005. The proceeds from this debt issuance were used to repay a bridge loan of $1,700.0 million and approximately $1,000.0 million in commercial paper borrowed to partially fund the December 28, 2005 WellChoice acquisition. Our securities lending payable declined during 2006, reflecting reduced amounts outstanding under the program. The offset to this is included in cash used in investing activities above. The increase in bank overdrafts reflects an increase in checks issued but outstanding at December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005. We increased our common stock repurchases during 2006, completing an additional $4,216.8 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 During 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was $3,135.5 million, as compared to $1,078.5 million in 2004, an increase of $2,057.0 million. The increase resulted from improved net income, including the impact of our merger with WHN. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2005 included a full year of WHN cash flow activity following the merger. Net cash used in investing activities was $5,151.6 million in 2005, compared to cash used of $2,131.9 million in 2004, an increase in cash used of $3,019.7 million. The table below outlines the changes in investing cash flow between the two years: Change inCash Used inInvestingActivities (In millions) Increase in net purchases of investments $ (1,749.7 ) Increase in net purchases of subsidiaries (349.8 ) Increase in net sale of subsidiaries 92.8 Decrease in proceeds from settlement of a cash flow hedge (15.7 ) Increase in securities lending collateral (973.4 ) Increase in net purchases of property and equipment (23.9 ) Net increase in cash used in investing activities $ (3,019.7 ) The purchase of investment securities in 2005 increased from 2004 resulting from increased cash flows from operations driven by improved net income, including the impact of our merger with WHN. The increase in 2005 subsidiary purchases resulted primarily from the use of cash for the WellChoice and Lumenos acquisitions, as compared to cash used for the WHN merger in 2004. The increase in 2005 sale of subsidiaries resulted primarily from the receipt of cash for the sale of certain subsidiaries, as compared to no activity in 2004. The increase in securities lending collateral reflects increased amounts under this program. The offset to this is an increase in securities lending payable which is reported with cash provided by financing activities. 76 Table of Contents Net cash flow provided by financing activities was $3,299.1 million in 2005 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $2,046.1 million in 2004. The table below outlines the increase in cash flow provided by financing activities of $1,253.0 million between the two years: Change inCash Providedby FinancingActivities (In millions) Increase in proceeds from exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan $ 270.3 Increase in repurchases of common stock (251.1 ) Increase in net proceeds from commercial paper borrowings 15.0 Decrease in repayment of long-term borrowings 643.4 Decrease in long-term borrowings (70.2 ) Decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock under Equity Security Units stock purchase contracts (230.0 ) Increase in securities lending payable 973.4 Decrease in bank overdrafts (103.5 ) Other 5.7 Net increase in cash provided by financing activities $ 1,253.0 The increase in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options reflects the significant increase in employees with vested options due to our merger with WHN. The increase in repurchases of common stock reflects the activity in our Board-approved common stock repurchase program. The decrease in repayments of long-term debt resulted primarily from the significant amount of repayments in 2004 as new long-term debt was issued to partially pay off outstanding long-term debt and fund the WHN merger. The decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under Equity Security Units stock purchase contracts reflects the maturity of these instruments in 2004. The increase in securities lending payable reflects increased amounts outstanding under this program, and is offset in cash used in investing activities. The decrease in bank overdrafts reflects fewer checks issued but outstanding at December 2005 as compared to December 2004. Financial Condition We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, of $20.8 billion at December 31, 2006. Since December 31, 2005, total cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, increased by $476.2 million as cash generated from operations was used for the repurchase of our common stock. Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Also, in connection with the WHN merger, the Company and certain of our subsidiaries in California and Georgia executed undertakings with the California Department of Managed Health Care, the California Department of Insurance and the Georgia Department of Insurance which contained various commitments, including the commitment to provide $61.5 million of support for health benefit programs in those states. Additional undertakings include the requirement to maintain certain capital levels at those subsidiaries. During 2006, we received $2.3 billion of dividends from our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006, we held at the parent company approximately $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments, which is available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, share and debt repurchases and interest payments. 77 Table of Contents Our consolidated debt-to-total capital ratio (calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt plus shareholders’ equity) was 22.2% as of December 31, 2006 and 21.4% as of December 31, 2005, which increased only slightly considering our $4.6 billion of common stock repurchases during 2006. Our senior debt is rated “BBB+” by Standard & Poor’s, “A-” by Fitch, Inc., “Baa1” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “a-” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. A significant downgrade in our debt ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs. Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity On December 28, 2005, we filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. At the time of an offering, specific information regarding terms of the offering and the securities being offered will be provided. Proceeds from any future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt, capitalization of our subsidiaries or the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion. On January 10, 2006, we issued $700.0 million of 5.000% notes due 2011; $1.1 billion of 5.250% notes due 2016; and $900.0 million of 5.850% notes due 2036 under this registration statement. The proceeds from this debt issuance were used to repay a bridge loan of $1,700.0 million and $1,000.0 million in commercial paper borrowed to partially fund the December 28, 2005 acquisition of WellChoice. On November 29, 2005, we entered into a senior revolving credit facility, or the facility, with certain lenders for general corporate purposes. We amended the facility on September 21, 2006. The facility, as amended, provides credit up to $2.5 billion (reduced for any commercial paper issuances) and matures on September 30, 2011. The interest rate on this facility is based on either (i) the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined percentage rate based on our credit rating at the date of utilization, or (ii) a base rate as defined in the facility agreement. Our ability to borrow under this facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2006 or during the year then ended. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.2 billion available under this facility. We have Board of Directors’ approval to borrow up to $2.5 billion under our commercial paper program (increased from $2.0 billion on March 15, 2006). Proceeds from any issuance of commercial paper may be used for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of our debt and common stock. Commercial paper notes are short-term senior unsecured notes, with a maturity not to exceed 270 days from date of issuance. When issued, the notes bear interest at the then current market rates. There were $1.3 billion of borrowings outstanding under this commercial paper program as of December 31, 2006. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2006 are classified as long-term debt as our practice and intent is to replace short-term commercial paper outstanding at expiration with additional short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one year or with borrowings under our senior credit facility. As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we are currently estimating approximately $2.7 billion of dividends to be paid to the parent company during 2007. During December 2004, WellPoint completed a tender offer to purchase subsidiary surplus notes from the holders, and purchased $258.0 million of 9.125% notes due 2010 and $174.9 million of 9.000% notes due 2027. During December 2006, the subsidiary repurchased these surplus notes from WellPoint. We maintain a common stock repurchase program as authorized by our Board of Directors. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. We purchased approximately 60.7 million shares during the year ended December 31, 2006 at a cost of $4.6 billion. On March 15, May 16, August 17 and December 7, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized 78 Table of Contents increases of $1.0 billion, $1.0 billion, $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, in our common stock repurchase program, which increased the total authorized common stock repurchases to $5.5 billion since the current program’s inception in 2005. As of December 31, 2006, we had $0.9 billion of authorization remaining under this program. Subsequent to December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 6.0 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $463.5 million, leaving approximately $486.3 million for authorized future repurchases at February 12, 2007. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares because we believe it is a prudent use of surplus capital. Our current pension funding strategy is to fund an amount at least equal to the minimum required funding as determined under ERISA with consideration of maximum tax deductible amounts. For the year ended December 31, 2006, no contributions to retirement benefit plans under ERISA were required, however, the Company elected to make tax deductible discretionary contributions totaling $108.6 million. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2006 are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 Years (In millions) Long-term debt, including capital leases1 $ 10,871.9 $ 2,130.3 $ 908.5 $ 1,286.9 $ 6,546.2 Operating lease commitments 1,061.4 145.7 270.5 202.2 443.0 Projected other postretirement benefits 919.1 37.5 200.9 207.6 473.1 Purchase obligations: IBM outsourcing agreements2 935.6 170.1 340.2 340.2 85.1 Other purchase obligations3 450.0 105.2 149.5 128.6 66.7 Other long-term liabilities 761.7 — 302.7 301.0 158.0 Venture capital commitments 261.5 88.0 164.4 7.8 1.3 Total contractual obligations and commitments $ 15,261.2 $ 2,676.8 $ 2,336.7 $ 2,474.3 $ 7,773.4 1 Includes estimated interest expense. 2 Relates to agreements with International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, to provide information technology infrastructure services. See Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 for further information. 3 Includes obligations related to IT service agreements and telecommunication contracts. In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our credit agreement or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions. For additional information on our debt and lease commitments, see Notes 7 and 16, respectively, to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this Form 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have agreed to guarantee up to $37.0 million of debt incurred by an unaffiliated entity to partially finance the purchase of a hospital. 79 Table of Contents In connection with an investment in a joint venture to develop and operate a well-being center in California, we may be required, based on specific targets, to make additional capital contributions up to $18.0 million. The well-being center was completed and began operations during November 2006. In connection with the formation in 2000 of a joint venture providing Medicaid services in Puerto Rico, we agreed under certain circumstances to provide additional funding to the joint venture entity. Since the formation of the joint venture in 2000, we have not been required to make any payments under this guarantee. During December 2006, the joint venture was terminated and the guarantee was extinguished. For additional information on these off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this Form 10-K. Risk-Based Capital Our regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies largely based on the NAIC’s RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under this Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our risk-based capital as of December 31, 2006, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, was in excess of all mandatory RBC thresholds. In addition to exceeding the RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries. XI. Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 This document contains certain forward-looking information about WellPoint, Inc.

As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on WellPoint’s financial position as of December 31, 2006. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return. Investments Our investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk. The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit downgrade to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that downgrade. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately AA. Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which represent an exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value. Our portfolio includes corporate securities (approximately 34% of the total fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2006), which are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. This risk is managed through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately A-. Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systematic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 88% of our available-for-sale investments were fixed maturity securities. Market risk is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an 81 Table of Contents approximate $619.0 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $583.0 million increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly. Our available-for-sale equity securities portfolio, as of December 31, 2006, was approximately 12% of our investments. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $207.1 million. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $207.1 million. Long-Term Debt Our total long-term debt at December 31, 2006 was $7.0 billion, and included $1.3 billion of commercial paper. The carrying value of the commercial paper approximates fair value as the underlying instruments have variable interest rates at market value. The remainder of the debt is subject to interest rate risk as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2006, we had $5.6 billion of senior unsecured notes with fixed interest rates. These notes, at par value, included $200.0 million at 3.50% due 2007, $300.0 million at 3.75% due 2007, $300.0 million at 4.25% due 2009, $700.0 million at 5.000% due 2011, $350.0 million at 6.375% due 2012, $800.0 million at 6.80% due 2012, $500.0 million at 5.00% due 2014, $1,100.0 million at 5.250% due 2016, $500.0 million at 5.95% due 2034 and $900.0 at 5.850% due 2036. These notes had combined carrying and estimated fair value of $5.6 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Our subordinated debt includes surplus notes issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries. Par value of amounts outstanding at December 31, 2006 included $42.0 million of 9.125% surplus notes due 2010 and $25.1 million of 9.000% surplus notes due 2027. Any payment of interest or principal on the surplus notes may be made only with the prior approval of the Indiana Department of Insurance. The combined carrying value of the surplus notes was $66.6 million and $66.5 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The estimated fair value of the surplus notes exceeded the carrying value by $13.6 million and $16.7 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. Derivatives We use derivative financial instruments, specifically interest rate swap agreements, to hedge exposure in interest rate risk on our borrowings. Our derivative use is generally limited to hedging purposes and we generally do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we entered into two fair value hedges with a total notional value of $440.0 million. The first hedge is a $240.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to receive a fixed 6.800% rate and pay a LIBOR-based floating rate and expires on August 1, 2012. The second hedge is a $200.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to receive a fixed 5.000% rate and pay a LIBOR-based floating rate and expires on December 15, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we entered into two fair value hedges with a total notional value of $660.0 million. The first hedge is a $360.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 6.800% rate for a LIBOR-based floating rate and expires on August 1, 2012. The second hedge is a $300.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 5.000% rate for LIBOR-based floating 82 Table of Contents rate and expires December 15, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we entered into a $300.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 3.750% rate for a LIBOR-based floating rate. This swap agreement expires on December 14, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we entered into a floating to fixed rate cash flow hedge with a total notional value of $480.0 million. The purpose of this hedge is to offset the variability of the cash flows due to the rollover of our variable-rate one-month commercial paper issuance. In December 2006, the total notional value was reduced to $240.0 million. This swap agreement expires in December 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, no gain or loss from hedged ineffectiveness was recorded in earnings and the commercial paper borrowings remain outstanding at December 31, 2006. Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these swap agreements. As of December 31, 2006, we recorded an asset of $17.4 million and a liability of $29.0 million, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swap’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $59.2 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $59.2 million increase in fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we entered into forward starting pay fixed swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $875.0 million. The objective of these hedges was to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the interest payments on the debt securities to be issued to partially fund the cash portion of the WellChoice acquisition. These swaps were terminated in January 2006, and we paid a net $24.7 million, the net fair value at the time of termination. In addition, we recorded an unrealized loss of $16.0 million, net of tax, as accumulated other comprehensive income. Following the January 10, 2006 issuance of debt securities in connection with the WellChoice acquisition, the unamortized fair value of the forward starting pay fixed swaps included in accumulated other comprehensive income began amortizing into earnings, as an increase to interest expense, over the life of the hedged debt securities. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we entered into forward starting pay fixed swaps and treasury lock swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $2.0 billion. The objective of these hedges was to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the interest payments on the debt securities to be issued to partially fund the cash portion of the WHN merger. These swaps were terminated in 2004, and we received a net $15.7 million, the net fair value at the time of termination. In addition, we recorded an unrealized gain of $10.2 million, net of tax, as accumulated other comprehensive income. Following the completion of the WHN merger on November 30, 2004, we issued debt securities, and the unamortized fair value of the forward starting pay fixed swaps included in balances in accumulated other comprehensive income began amortizing into earnings, as a reduction of interest expense, over the life of the debt securities. The unrecognized loss for all cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2006 was $5.6 million. As of December 31, 2006, the total amount of amortization over the next twelve months for all cash flow hedges will increase interest expense by approximately $0.7 million. 83 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:53:06.585377

Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 I. Executive Summary We are the largest health benefits company in terms of commercial membership in the United States, serving 34.8 million medical members as of December 31, 2007. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or BCBS, licensee for: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (as BCBS in 10 New York City metropolitan and surrounding counties, and as Blue Cross or BCBS in selected upstate counties only), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. We also serve customers throughout the country as UniCare. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states through our subsidiaries. Operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $60.1 billion, an increase of $4.0 billion, or 7%, over the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating revenue increases were primarily driven by premium rate increases in Local Group, growth in our State Sponsored business primarily due to the addition of five new states between the third quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, growth of our Medicare Advantage products and increased reimbursement in the Federal Employee Program, or FEP. Our fully-diluted earnings per share, or EPS, was $5.56 for the year ended December 31, 2007, which included $0.01 per share from net realized investment gains, and was a 15% increase over the EPS of $4.82 for the year ended December 31, 2006, which included $0.04 per share in tax benefits resulting from a change in state tax apportionment factors. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $3.3 billion, an 8% increase over the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $4.3 billion, or 1.3 times net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $4.0 billion, or 1.3 times net income. The increase in operating cash flow from 2006 was driven primarily by higher net income in 2007. We have successfully executed our strategy to deliver on our long-term goal of achieving at least 15% growth in EPS. We have accomplished this by focusing on profitable enrollment growth with innovative product 40 Table of Contents offerings, pricing with discipline, implementing initiatives to optimize the cost of care, continuing to leverage administrative costs over a larger membership base, further penetrating our specialty businesses and by using our cash flow effectively, including share repurchases. We intend to continue expanding through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and capital transactions in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of the additional economies of scale provided by increased overall membership as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. While we have achieved strong growth as a result of strategic mergers and acquisitions, we have also achieved organic growth in our existing markets by providing excellent service, offering competitively priced products and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks. II. Overview We revised our reportable segments during the first quarter of 2007 consistent with changes made to our organizational structure, which reflected how the chief operating decision maker evaluated the performance of the business beginning January 1, 2007. Segment disclosures for 2006 and 2005 have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation. Through December 31, 2007, we managed our operations through three reportable segments: Consumer and Commercial Business, or CCB; Specialty, Senior and State Sponsored Business, or 4SB; and Other. Our CCB segment includes business units which offer similar products and services, including commercial accounts and individual programs. CCB offers a diversified mix of managed care products, including PPOs, HMOs, traditional indemnity benefits and POS plans. CCB also offers a variety of hybrid benefit plans including CDHPs, hospital only and limited benefit products. Additionally, CCB provides a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers, including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management and other administrative services. Our 4SB segment is comprised of businesses providing health and specialty products and services such as Medicare Part D, Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, Medicaid, life and disability insurance benefits, pharmacy benefit management, or PBM, specialty pharmacy, dental, vision, behavioral health benefit services and long-term care insurance. 4SB also provides network rental and medical management services to workers compensation carriers. The Other segment includes results from our Federal Government Solutions, or FGS, business and other businesses that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, or FAS 131, as well as intersegment sales and expense eliminations and corporate expenses not allocated to the other reportable segments. FGS business includes FEP and National Government Services, Inc. (which name changed from AdminaStar Federal, Inc. effective November 17, 2006), or NGS, which acts as a Medicare contractor in several regions across the nation. On October 2, 2007, we announced a new organizational structure with new strategic business units: a Commercial Business unit and a Consumer Business unit that service different customer types (see Membership in this MD&A for a definition of our customer types discussed below). The Commercial Business unit includes Local Group customers, National Accounts, UniCare and Specialty business operations (dental, vision, life and disability and workers’ compensation). The Consumer Business unit includes Senior, State Sponsored and Individual business. In addition, a new Comprehensive Health Solutions Business unit brings together our resources focused on optimizing the quality of health care and the cost of care management. The Comprehensive Health Solutions Business unit includes provider relations, care and disease management, behavioral health, 41 Table of Contents employee assistance programs and our PBM business, which includes NextRx, and our specialty pharmacy, PrecisionRx Specialty Solutions. Our FGS business includes FEP and NGS, which acts as a Medicare contractor. This simplified, customer-focused structure builds on the strength of our commercial and consumer businesses, and will create additional opportunities for cross-selling medical and specialty products. These changes also emphasize our comprehensive approach to improving the quality, transparency and cost of health care for all of our customers. Our chief operating decision maker will assess performance under this new structure effective January 1, 2008 and, accordingly, we expect to revise our reportable segments in the first quarter of 2008. See Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 included in this Form 10-K. Our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue comes from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. Administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, or where the fee is based on either processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized. Additionally, we earn administrative fee revenues from our Medicare processing business and from other health-related businesses including disease management programs. Other revenue is principally generated from member co-payments and deductibles associated with the mail-order sale of drugs by our PBM companies. Our benefit expense includes costs of care for health services consumed by our members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. Our selling expense consists of external broker commission expenses, and generally varies with premium volume. Our general and administrative expense consists of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Other costs are variable or discretionary in nature. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium, but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels, and thus associate compensation expense. Examples of discretionary costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity. Our cost of drugs consists of the amounts we pay to pharmaceutical companies for the drugs we sell via mail order through our PBM and specialty pharmacy companies. This amount excludes the cost of drugs related to affiliated health customers recorded in benefit expense. Our cost of drugs can be influenced by the volume of prescriptions at our PBM companies, as well as cost changes, driven by prices set by pharmaceutical companies and mix of drugs sold. Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management programs. Several economic factors related to health care costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage, technological advancements and the advancement in the delivery of medical services, as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating health care costs as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material impact on our results of operations. 42 Table of Contents This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 included in this Form 10-K. III. Significant Transactions Stock Repurchase Program We maintain a common stock repurchase program as authorized by our Board of Directors. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. The repurchases are effected from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act, as amended. During the year ended December 31, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized increases of $9.5 billion in our stock repurchase program, resulting in a total amount available for repurchases in 2007 and thereafter of $10.4 billion, which included $0.95 billion of authorization remaining unused at December 31, 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased and retired approximately 76.9 million shares at an average share price of $79.99, for an aggregate cost of $6.2 billion. Therefore, as of December 31, 2007, $4.3 billion remained authorized for future repurchases. Subsequent to December 31, 2007, we repurchased and retired approximately 15.0 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $1.2 billion, leaving approximately $3.1 billion for authorized future repurchases at February 12, 2008. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares because we believe it is a prudent use of surplus capital. Acquisition of Imaging Management Holdings, LLC On August 1, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Imaging Management Holdings, LLC, or IMH, whose sole business is the holding company parent of American Imaging Management, Inc., or AIM. AIM is a leading radiology benefit management and technology company and provides services to us as well as other customers nationwide, including nine other Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees. The acquisition supports our strategy to become the leader in affordable quality care by incorporating AIM’s services and technology for more effective and efficient use of radiology services by our members. The purchase price for the acquisition was approximately $300.0 million in cash. Acquisition of WellChoice, Inc. On December 28, 2005 (December 31, 2005 for accounting purposes), WellPoint completed its acquisition of WellChoice. The acquisition of WellChoice strengthened our leadership in providing health benefits to National Accounts and provided us with a strategic presence in New York City, the headquarters of more Fortune 500 companies than any other U.S. city. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the stockholders of WellChoice (other than subsidiaries of WellPoint) received consideration of $38.25 in cash and 0.5191 of a share of WellPoint common stock for each share of WellChoice common stock outstanding. In addition, WellChoice stock options and other awards were converted to WellPoint awards in accordance with the merger agreement. The purchase price including cash, fair value of stock and stock awards and estimated transaction costs was approximately $6.5 billion. Multi-District Litigation Settlement Agreement On July 11, 2005, we announced that an agreement was reached with representatives of more than 700,000 physicians nationwide involved in two multi-district class-action lawsuits against us and other health benefits companies. As part of the Multi-District Litigation Settlement Agreement, or the MDL Agreement, we agreed to pay $135.0 million to physicians and to contribute $5.0 million to a not-for-profit foundation whose mission is to promote higher quality health care and to enhance the delivery of care to the disadvantaged and underserved. In addition, we paid $61.3 million in legal fees, including interest, on October 6, 2006. As a result of the MDL 43 Table of Contents Agreement, we incurred a pre-tax expense of $103.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, or $0.10 EPS, which represented the final settlement amount of the MDL Agreement that was not previously accrued. Appeals of the settlement initially filed by certain physicians were resolved and final cash payments under the agreement totaling $209.5 million, including accrued interest, were made on October 5 and 6, 2006. Acquisition of Lumenos, Inc. On June 9, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Lumenos, Inc., or Lumenos, for approximately $185.0 million in cash paid to the stockholders of Lumenos. Lumenos is recognized as a pioneer and market leader in consumer-driven health programs. Two-For-One Stock Split On April 25, 2005, WellPoint’s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of shares of common stock, which was effected in the form of a 100 percent common stock dividend. All shareholders of record on May 13, 2005 received one additional share of WellPoint common stock for each share of common stock held on that date. The additional shares of common stock were distributed to shareholders of record in the form of a stock dividend on May 31, 2005. All historical weighted average share and per share amounts and all references to stock compensation data and market prices of our common stock for all periods presented in this MD&A have been adjusted to reflect this two-for-one stock split. Merger with WellPoint Health Networks Inc. On November 30, 2004, Anthem, Inc. and WellPoint Health Networks Inc., or WHN, completed their merger. The merger with WHN helped us to create the nation’s leading health benefits company and the largest holder of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licenses in the country. Additionally, our merger with WHN increased our presence in several new strategic markets, most notably California. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the stockholders of WHN (other than subsidiaries of WHN) received consideration of $23.80 in cash and one share of Anthem, Inc. common stock for each WHN share outstanding. In addition, WHN stock options and other awards were converted to WellPoint, Inc. awards in accordance with the merger agreement. The purchase price including cash, fair value of stock and stock awards and estimated transaction costs was approximately $15.8 billion. Anthem, Inc., the surviving corporate parent, was renamed WellPoint, Inc. concurrent with the merger. IV. Membership—December 31, 2007 Compared to December 31, 2006 Our customer type definitions were revised in the first quarter of 2007 to be consistent with how we managed our business effective January 1, 2007. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation. As of December 31, 2007, our medical membership includes seven different customer types: Local Group, Individual, National Accounts, BlueCard, Senior, State Sponsored and FEP. • Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 1,000 employees eligible to participate as a member in one of our health plans. In addition, Local Group includes customers with 1,000 or more eligible employees with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter’s state. • Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. • National Accounts customers are generally multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in a WellPoint service area with 1,000 or more eligible employees, with at least 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter’s state. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker relationships. Service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. • BlueCard host members represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by WellPoint who receive health care services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard membership 44 Table of Contents consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-WellPoint controlled BCBSA licensee (i.e., the “home” plan). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard claims received per month. • Senior members are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a managed care alternative for the Medicare program, or who have purchased Medicare Supplement benefit coverage. • State Sponsored membership represents eligible members with State Sponsored managed care alternatives in Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance programs. • FEP members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some self-funded customers choose to purchase stop-loss coverage to limit their retained risk. 45 Table of Contents The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. Also included below are key metrics from our Specialty business, including prescription volume for our PBM companies and membership by product. The membership data presented is unaudited and in certain instances includes estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

Previously a National Account was defined as a multi-state employer with 5,000 or more eligible employees. 2 Represents prescription volume for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. 3 Membership includes auto-assigned, stand-alone, Medicare Advantage, group waiver and external PBM members with the prescription drug plans. Certain of our Medicare Part D members are also Senior medical members. 46 Table of Contents During the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, total medical membership increased approximately 708,000, or 2%, primarily due to increases in National, including BlueCard, and State Sponsored business partially offset by declines in Local Group and Individual membership. Self-funded medical membership increased 992,000, or 6%, primarily due to an increase in self-funded National Accounts membership resulting from additional sales and in-group growth, BlueCard growth and the conversion of 144,000 members from the Connecticut Medicaid managed care program from fully-insured to self-funded during the fourth quarter of 2007. Fully-insured membership decreased 284,000, or 2%, primarily due to Local Group decreases, including conversions to self-funded arrangements and in-group changes, as well as due to the conversion of the Connecticut Medicaid managed care program from fully-insured to self-funded. These decreases were partially offset by increases in State Sponsored business, whose growth was driven by the addition of two new states during 2007 and growth in existing markets. Local Group membership decreased 103,000, or 1%, primarily driven by lapses and unfavorable in-group change in our non-BCBSA branded business. Individual membership decreased 98,000, or 4%, due to decreases in certain BCBSA-branded regions as well as in UniCare due to competitive pricing pressures and competitive broker compensation programs in certain regions. National Accounts membership increased 253,000, or 4%, primarily driven by in-group growth and additional sales as employers are increasingly attracted to the benefits of our distinctive value proposition, which includes extensive and cost-effective provider networks, wellness and care management programs and a broad and innovative product portfolio. BlueCard membership increased 284,000, or 7%, representing increased sales and corresponding claims by non-affiliated BCBSA licensees’ accounts with members who reside in or travel to our licensed area. Senior membership increased 57,000, or 5%, driven by growth in Medicare Advantage membership, partially offset by a slight decline in Medicare Supplement membership. State Sponsored membership increased 292,000, or 16%, primarily due to the addition of 172,000 new members in two new states during 2007, as well as growth in existing programs. Our specialty metrics are derived from membership and activity from our specialty products. These products are often ancillary to our health business, and can therefore be impacted by growth in our medical membership. Prescription volume in our PBM companies decreased slightly by 1,188,000, primarily due to lower non-Part D utilization in our retail and mail-order PBM, partially offset by higher Part D utilization. Behavioral health membership increased 3,293,000, or 19%, primarily due to the conversion of 2,882,000 members from a third-party vendor in April 2007 and growth in membership due to new sales of our behavioral health products. Life and disability membership decreased 372,000, or 6%, primarily due to a general decrease in both life and accidental death and disability membership, as well as membership changes at a large automotive customer. Dental membership decreased 256,000, or 5%, primarily due to the loss of the dental component within one of our State Sponsored plans and lapses due to a very competitive environment. 47 Table of Contents Vision membership increased 865,000, or 56%, primarily due to the conversion of members over the last twelve months from a competing plan in Virginia to our Blue View Vision product as well as general growth of this new product. Medicare Part D membership increased 46,000, or 3%, primarily due to growth in the Medicare Part D benefit component of our Medicare Advantage products. V. Cost of Care The following discussion summarizes our aggregate cost of care trends for the rolling 12 months ended December 31, 2007 for our Local Group and Individual fully-insured businesses only. Our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing the year-over-year change in average per member per month claim costs for which we are responsible, which excludes member co-payments and deductibles. While our cost of care trend varies by geographic location, based on medical cost trends during the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, our aggregate 2007 cost of care trend was less than 8%. Overall, our medical cost trend continues to be driven by unit costs. Inpatient hospital trend is in the mid-single digit range and is related to increases in cost per admission. Cost per admission is higher, due in part to the greater intensity of inpatient services as less intensive services are performed outpatient. Other drivers include negotiated rate increases with hospitals. However, we have noticed a slowing of the cost per admission trend in the latter part of 2007 due to our re-contracting and clinical management efforts. Utilization (admissions per 1,000 members) has been flat, while average length of hospital stay and hospital days per 1,000 members have both decreased slightly. Cost trend increases for outpatient services are in the upper-single digit range. Outpatient costs are a collection of different types of expenses, such as outpatient facilities, labs, x-rays, emergency room, and occupational and physical therapy. The increases are primarily driven by higher per visit costs as more procedures are being performed during each visit to outpatient providers, particularly emergency room visits, as well as the impact of price increases included within certain provider contracts. We are continuing to develop plan designs to encourage appropriate utilization of outpatient services and we are seeing the positive impact of our expanding radiology management programs on our outpatient trends. These programs are designed to ensure appropriate use of radiology services by our members. On August 1, 2007, we completed our acquisition of AIM. Incorporating their technology will allow us to achieve even greater efficiencies in this high trend area while ensuring that consumers receive the quality tests they need. Physician services trend is in the mid-single digit range and is about 65% cost driven and 35% utilization. Fee schedule changes are one of the drivers of these trends. We are collaborating with physicians to improve quality of care through pay-for-performance programs. Pharmacy trend is in the upper-single digit range and is 60% unit cost (cost per prescription) related and 40% utilization (prescriptions per member per year) driven. The increased use of specialty drugs and higher mail order volume by our members were primary drivers of the higher unit cost trend. Specialty drugs, also known as biotech drugs, are generally higher cost and are being utilized more frequently. In October 2007, we announced the opening of our new PrecisionRx Specialty Solutions pharmacy in Indianapolis, Indiana, which manages over 1,000 different drugs for 14 diseases including hemophilia, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, hepatitis C and cancer. We have built a technologically advanced specialty pharmacy staffed with certified pharmacy technicians, registered nurses and clinical pharmacists to better manage both the quality and cost of care for our members. Higher mail order volume contributes to higher cost per prescription as mail order prescriptions are filled for a 90 day supply versus a 30 day supply for retail pharmacy prescriptions. These increases in unit costs were offset by increases in our generic usage rates, lower utilization resulting from higher mail order volume, benefit plan design changes, and improved pharmaceutical contracting. Higher mail order volume contributes to a lower number of prescriptions as one mail order prescription is filled for a 90 day supply versus three 30 day retail prescriptions. 48 Table of Contents In response to cost trends, we continue to pursue contracting and plan design changes, promote and implement performance-based contracts that reward clinical outcomes and quality, and expand our radiology management, disease management and advanced care management programs. We continue to expand 360º Health, the industry’s first program to integrate all care management programs and tools into a centralized, consumer-friendly resource that assists patients in navigating the health care system, using their health benefits and accessing the most comprehensive and appropriate care available. In addition, we are expanding our specialty pharmacy programs and continuously evaluate our drug formulary to ensure the most effective pharmaceutical therapies are available for our members. VI. Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are discussed in the following section. Year Ended December 31 $ Change % Change 2007 2006 (In millions, except per share data) Premiums $ 55,865.0 $ 51,971.9 $ 3,893.1 7 % Administrative fees 3,674.6 3,595.4 79.2 2 Other revenue 582.4 593.1 (10.7 ) (2 ) Total operating revenue 60,122.0 56,160.4 3,961.6 7 Net investment income 1,001.1 878.7 122.4 14 Net realized gains (losses) on investments 11.2 (0.3 ) 11.5 NM 1 Total revenues 61,134.3 57,038.8 4,095.5 7 Benefit expense 46,036.1 42,191.4 3,844.7 9 Selling, general and administrative expense: Selling expense 1,716.8 1,654.5 62.3 4 General and administrative expense 6,984.7 7,163.2 (178.5 ) (2 ) Total selling, general and administrative expense 8,701.5 8,817.7 (116.2 ) (1 ) Cost of drugs 400.2 414.4 (14.2 ) (3 ) Interest expense 447.9 403.5 44.4 11 Amortization of other intangible assets 290.7 297.4 (6.7 ) (2 ) Total expenses 55,876.4 52,124.4 3,752.0 7 Income before income tax expense 5,257.9 4,914.4 343.5 7 Income tax expense 1,912.5 1,819.5 93.0 5 Net income $ 3,345.4 $ 3,094.9 $ 250.5 8 Average diluted shares outstanding 602.0 642.1 (40.1 ) (6 )% Diluted net income per share $ 5.56 $ 4.82 $ 0.74 15 % Benefit expense ratio2 82.4 % 81.2 % 120 bp3 Selling, general and administrative expense ratio4 14.5 % 15.7 % (120 )bp3 Income before income taxes as a percentage of total revenue 8.6 % 8.6 % 0 bp3 Net income as a percentage of total revenue 5.5 % 5.4 % 10 bp3 Certain of the following definitions are also applicable to all other results of operations tables in this discussion: 1 NM = Not meaningful 2 Benefit expense ratio = Benefit expense ÷ Premiums. 3 bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%. 4 Selling, general and administrative expense ratio = Total selling, general and administrative expense ÷ Total operating revenue. 49 Table of Contents Premiums increased $3.9 billion, or 7%, to $55.9 billion in 2007, driven by premium rate increases in Local Group, growth in our State Sponsored business primarily due to the addition of five new states between the third quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, growth in Medicare Advantage business and increased reimbursement in FEP. Administrative fees increased $79.2 million, or 2%, to $3.7 billion in 2007, primarily due to self-funded membership growth in National, including BlueCard, and Local Group. Self-funded membership growth was driven by successful efforts to attract large self-funded accounts and was attributable to our network breadth, discounts, service and increased focus on health improvement and wellness, as well as the success of the BlueCard program. Other revenue is comprised principally of co-payments and deductibles associated with the sale of mail-order prescription drugs by our PBM companies, which provide services to members of our CCB and 4SB segments and third party clients. Other revenue decreased $10.7 million, or 2%, to $582.4 million in 2007, primarily due to decreased prescription volume from third party customers in our mail-order PBM business, partially offset by continued growth in specialty pharmacy prescription volume. Net investment income increased $122.4 million, or 14%, to $1.0 billion in 2007 primarily resulting from higher yields and growth in invested assets driven by reinvestments of cash generated from operations. This growth was partially offset by the use of cash for repurchases of our common stock. A summary of our net realized gains (losses) on investments for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 is as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2007 2006 $ Change (In millions) Net realized gains (losses) from the sale of fixed maturity securities $ 11.5 $ (47.9 ) $ 59.4 Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities 254.2 98.5 155.7 Other-than-temporary impairments—credit related (113.4 ) (32.5 ) (80.9 ) Other-than-temporary impairments—interest rate related (146.3 ) (23.7 ) (122.6 ) Other realized gains 5.2 5.3 (0.1 ) Net realized gains (losses) $ 11.2 $ (0.3 ) $ 11.5 Net realized gains on investments in 2007 were primarily driven by sales of equity securities at a gain, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities due to rising interest rates and impairments of equity securities. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in this MD&A for a discussion of our investment impairment review process. Net realized losses on investments in 2006 related primarily to the sale of fixed maturity securities at a loss and other-than-temporary impairments, partially offset by the sale of equity securities at a gain. Benefit expense increased $3.8 billion, or 9%, to $46.0 billion in 2007, primarily due to higher cost in the 4SB segment and medical cost trend in the CCB segment. Benefit expense for the 4SB segment increased primarily due to growth in State Sponsored business with the addition of five new states between the third quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, as well as growth in our Medicare Advantage business. Benefit expense in the CCB segment increased primarily due to medical cost trend in Local Group business. Lastly, continued increased trend in FEP business resulted in higher benefit expense, for which we are reimbursed for the cost plus a fee. 50 Table of Contents Our benefit expense ratio increased 120 basis points to 82.4% in 2007, primarily related to the medical business of the 4SB segment and, to a lesser extent, the CCB segment, including a business mix shift resulting from a decline in Individual membership. The increase in 4SB’s benefit expense ratio resulted from higher trend in State Sponsored business and Medicare Advantage. The benefit expense ratio of State Sponsored business was unfavorably impacted by a higher benefit expense ratio in the Ohio Covered Families & Children’s Medicaid program and the Connecticut Medicaid program in 2007 compared to the prior year. In January 2008, we notified the state of Ohio that we will terminate participation in the Ohio Medicaid program by March 31, 2008 as we were unable to reach an agreement to service these members in a financially responsible manner. In addition, the Connecticut Medicaid program was fully-insured through November 30, 2007 and converted to self-funded business effective December 1, 2007. The current self-funded arrangement with the Connecticut Medicaid program will expire on March 31, 2008 and we are in negotiations with the state on extending the contract. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $116.2 million, or 1%, to $8.7 billion, primarily due to lower salary and benefit costs including performance-based incentive compensation, partially offset by higher costs associated with growth of our business. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 120 basis points to 14.5%. This decrease in our selling, general and administrative expense ratio was primarily due to growth in operating revenue and further leveraging of general and administrative costs over a larger membership base. Cost of drugs decreased $14.2 million, or 3%, to $400.2 million in 2007. This decrease was primarily attributable to decreased PBM mail-order prescription volume from our third party customers and higher utilization of generic prescription drugs, partially offset by higher specialty pharmacy prescription volume. Interest expense increased $44.4 million, or 11%, to $447.9 million in 2007, primarily due to the issuance of approximately $2.0 billion of long-term debt in 2007. Amortization of other intangible assets decreased $6.7 million, or 2%, to $290.7 million in 2007, primarily due to certain intangibles amortizing on an accelerated amortization schedule over their estimated life, which resulted in greater expense in earlier periods. Income tax expense increased $93.0 million, or 5%, to $1.9 billion in 2007. The effective tax rate declined 60 basis points to 36.4% in 2007. The 2006 effective tax rate of 37.0% included a reduction of 60 basis points due to a $28.0 million tax benefit that was recognized in 2006 resulting from lower effective state tax rates. In addition, the 2007 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by various tax settlements. Our net income as a percentage of total revenue was 5.5% in 2007 compared to 5.4% in 2006, which reflects a combination of all of the factors discussed above. Reportable Segments We use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments. Effective January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007, and in accordance with FAS 131, our reportable segments were CCB, 4SB and Other. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, selling, general and administrative expense and cost of drugs. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. For additional information, see Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. The discussions of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our reportable segments’ results of operations for 2006 have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation. 51 Table of Contents CCB Our CCB segment’s summarized results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 2007 2006 $ Change % Change (In millions) Operating revenue $ 42,122.0 $ 40,602.6 $ 1,519.4 4 % Operating gain $ 3,999.7 $ 3,679.5 $ 320.2 9 % Operating margin 9.5 % 9.1 % 40 bp Operating revenue increased $1.5 billion, or 4%, to $42.1 billion in 2007, primarily due to premium rate increases across all lines of business, partially offset by membership declines in Local Group and a shift in the mix of business from fully-insured to self-funded. Operating gain increased $320.2 million, or 9%, to $4.0 billion in 2007 driven by disciplined pricing as operating revenue growth outpaced increased benefit expense, primarily in Local Group. In addition, selling, general and administrative expense decreased in 2007 driven by lower performance-based incentive compensation. The operating margin in 2007 was 9.5%, a 40 basis point increase primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. 4SB Our 4SB segment’s summarized results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 2007 2006 $ Change % Change (In millions) Operating revenue $ 13,715.4 $ 11,553.1 $ 2,162.3 19 % Operating gain $ 972.3 $ 1,117.0 $ (144.7 ) (13 )% Operating margin 7.1 % 9.7 % (260 )bp Operating revenue increased $2.2 billion, or 19%, to $13.7 billion in 2007, primarily due to growth in State Sponsored business including the addition of five new states between the third quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, growth in Medicare Advantage and growth in Medicare Part D. Operating gain decreased $144.7 million, or 13%, to $972.3 million in 2007, primarily due to deterioration in the performance of the State Sponsored business and lower profitability in Medicare Supplement, partially offset by growth in our PBM business. The deterioration in the performance of State Sponsored business was driven by our Medicaid contracts in Connecticut and Ohio, as discussed above. The decline in profitability of our Medicare Supplement products was primarily due to the aging of our member population in that business. The operating margin in 2007 was 7.1%, a 260 basis point decrease primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs coupled with a continuing shift in business mix, which includes growth in lower-margin State Sponsored business. 52 Table of Contents Other Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 2007 2006 $ Change % Change (In millions) Operating revenue from external customers $ 5,985.2 $ 5,441.8 543.4 10 % Elimination of intersegment revenue (1,700.6 ) (1,437.1 ) (263.5 ) (18 )% Total operating revenue $ 4,284.6 $ 4,004.7 $ 279.9 7 % Operating gain (loss) $ 12.2 $ (59.6 ) $ 71.8 NM Operating revenue from external customers increased $543.4 million, or 10%, to $6.0 billion in 2007, primarily due to higher premiums in FEP business. The elimination of intersegment revenue increased $263.5 million, or 18%, in 2007, primarily reflecting additional sales of pharmacy products by our 4SB segment’s PBM companies to our CCB segment. Operating gain was $12.2 million in 2007, an increase of $71.8 million over the operating loss of $59.6 million in 2006. This increase was primarily driven by the non-recurrence of retention bonuses associated with the merger of the former Anthem, Inc. and the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc. along with improved operating gain of our FEP business. 53 Table of Contents VII. Membership—December 31, 2006 Compared to December 31, 2005 The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. Also included below are key metrics from our Specialty business, including prescription volume for our PBM companies and membership by product. The membership data presented is unaudited and in certain instances includes estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

Our reclassifications for minimum premium amendments to fully-insured contracts resulted in an increase in self-funded membership and a corresponding decrease in fully-insured membership in the 2005 information, with no impact on total medical membership. Effective January 1, 2007, we revised our definition of a National Account to include multi-state employers primarily headquartered in our service area with 1,000 or more eligible employees, of which at least 5% or more are located in a service area outside of the headquarter state. 2 Represents prescription volume for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. 3 Effective January 1, 2006, we began marketing Medicare Part D to eligible Medicare beneficiaries in all 50 states. Membership includes auto-assigned, stand-alone, Medicare Advantage, group waiver and external PBM members with the prescription drug plans. Certain of our Medicare Part D members are also Senior medical members. 54 Table of Contents During the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, total medical membership increased approximately 245,000, or 1%, primarily due to increases in our National Accounts and BlueCard partially offset by the loss of 315,000 Local Group members in the state of Georgia, as well as approximately 95,000 members of another Local Group account, which was previously disclosed. Also, in December 2006, our ownership of a joint venture in Puerto Rico changed from a 50 percent ownership of a Medicaid managed care subsidiary to a smaller percentage in the joint venture’s parent company. Accordingly, we no longer include the 222,000 members related to this investment in our reported enrollment. Local Group membership decreased 508,000, or 3%, primarily due to the loss of the state of Georgia PPO contract and the other Local Group account previously disclosed, partially offset by new sales. National Accounts membership increased 504,000, or 9%, primarily due to success in attracting new customers as they recognize the value of the BCBS networks and discounts. BlueCard membership increased 364,000, or 9%, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, due to increased sales by other BCBSA licensees to accounts with members who reside in or travel to our licensed areas. State Sponsored membership decreased 108,000, or 5%, primarily due to the membership accounting change related to our Puerto Rico joint venture investment discussed above. Partially offsetting this 222,000 member decrease, we added 68,000 new members from the acquisition of QualChoice Select, Inc. and won new business in five states in 2006 due to our comprehensive array of health management services we make available to the nation’s Medicaid recipients. Self-funded medical membership increased 161,000, or 1%, primarily due to increases in our National Accounts and BlueCard businesses and shifts in the mix of business from fully-insured to self-funded, partially offset by the loss of the state of Georgia PPO contract and the other Local Group contract noted above, as well as the impact of the Puerto Rico joint venture membership accounting change. Fully-insured membership increased by 84,000 members, primarily due to the August 1, 2006 acquisition of QualChoice Select, Inc. Our specialty metrics are derived from membership and activity from our specialty products. These products are often ancillary to our health business, and can therefore be impacted by growth in our medical membership. Prescription volume in our PBM companies increased by 48,047,000, or 14%, during the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to growth in both our retail and mail order operations driven by the addition of Medicare Part D. Behavioral health membership increased 1,268,000, or 8%, during the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to a 568,000 membership gain from the acquisition of Behavioral Health Network in New Hampshire in October 2006, as well as 347,000 new members from sales of our behavioral health products. Vision membership increased 720,000, or 88%, due to the introduction of our Blue View Vision product and the associated conversion of 432,000 members of a competing plan in Virginia to this new product, as well as new sales in several markets. 55 Table of Contents VIII.

We discuss our 2006 and 2005 operations using “comparable basis” information, which is presented to provide a more meaningful prior-year comparison to the current year, due to our December 28, 2005 acquisition of WellChoice. Comparable basis information is not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of WellPoint had the acquisition been completed as of January 1, 2005. Comparable basis information for the year ended December 31, 2005 was calculated by adding the reclassified historical statements of income for WellPoint and WellChoice and includes no intercompany eliminations or pro forma adjustments.

Premiums increased $11.3 billion, or 28%, to $52.0 billion in 2006. On a comparable basis, premiums increased $5.4 billion, or 12%, primarily due to premium rate increases across all customer types, the addition of the New York state prescription drug contract and new enrollment in our Medicare Part D products. Administrative fees increased $803.4 million, or 29%, to $3.6 billion in 2006. On a comparable basis, administrative fees increased $197.6 million, or 6%, primarily due to self-funded membership growth in National Accounts, including BlueCard, and rate increases in Local Group and National Accounts. Self-funded membership growth was driven by successful efforts to attract large self-funded accounts and was attributable to our network breadth, discounts, service and increased focus on health improvement and wellness, as well as the popularity of the BlueCard program. Other revenue principally includes amounts from mail-order prescription drug sales by our PBM companies, which provide services to members of our CCB and 4SB segments and third party clients. Other revenue increased $73.9 million, or 14%, to $593.1 million in 2006. On a comparable basis, other revenue increased $74.9 million, or 14%, primarily due to revenue generated by growth in mail-order prescription volume from sales to our CCB and 4SB segments and third parties. Increased mail-order prescription volume resulted from additional utilization of our PBM companies’ mail-order pharmacy option with the introduction of Medicare Part D. Net investment income increased $245.6 million, or 39%, to $878.7 million in 2006 primarily resulting from invested assets acquired with the acquisition of WellChoice, growth in invested assets from reinvestment of cash generated from operations and higher interest rates. This growth was partially offset by the use of cash for repurchases of our common stock. 58 Table of Contents A summary of our net realized losses on investments for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 is as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2006 2005 $ Change (In millions) Net realized losses from the sale of fixed maturity securities $ (47.9 ) $ (25.3 ) $ (22.6 ) Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities 98.5 22.0 76.5 Other-than-temporary impairments—credit related (32.5 ) (14.8 ) (17.7 ) Other-than-temporary impairments—interest rate related (23.7 ) — (23.7 ) Other realized gains 5.3 7.9 (2.6 ) Net realized losses $ (0.3 ) $ (10.2 ) $ 9.9 Net realized losses in 2006 primarily related to other-than-temporary impairments of investments and the sale of fixed maturity securities at a loss due to the restructuring of the combined portfolio after our acquisition of WellChoice at the end of 2005. Other-than-temporary impairments—credit related were primarily due to the length of time that equity securities’ fair value was below their cost basis. Other-than-temporary impairments—interest related were primarily due to the prevailing interest rate environment and our intent to hold fixed maturity securities until their anticipated recovery. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in this MD&A for a discussion of our investment impairment review process. These losses were partially offset by realized gains on the sale of equity securities during 2006. Net realized losses in 2005 primarily related to net realized losses on sales of fixed maturity securities due to the restructuring of the combined portfolio after our merger with WHN at the end of 2004 and credit-related other-than-temporary impairments of equity and fixed maturity securities. These realized losses were partially offset by net realized gains on sales of equity securities and other invested assets. Benefit expense increased $9.6 billion, or 29%, to $42.2 billion in 2006. On a comparable basis, benefit expense increased $4.5 billion, or 12%, primarily due to increased cost of care, which was driven by higher costs in outpatient and inpatient services, the addition of the New York State prescription drug contract and benefit expense for our Medicare Part D products. On a comparable basis, our benefit expense ratio increased 30 basis points to 81.2% in 2006. This increase was primarily related to a change in business mix, primarily driven by the addition of the New York State prescription drug contract, growth in FEP and State Sponsored business, as well as the introduction of Medicare Part D. All of these products have a higher benefit expense ratio than the WellPoint average. These increases were partially offset by disciplined pricing and the non-recurrence of $35.0 million of benefit expense recorded in the second quarter of 2005 related to the multi-district litigation settlement agreement, or MDL Agreement, discussed in Significant Transactions within this MD&A. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $1.5 billion, or 21%, to $8.8 billion in 2006. On a comparable basis, selling, general and administrative expense increased $498.1 million, or 6%. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to increases in volume-sensitive costs such as commissions, premium taxes and other expenses associated with growth in our business, as well as additional share-based compensation expense resulting from our January 1, 2006 adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, or FAS 123R. See Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 included in this Form 10-K. On a comparable basis, our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 80 basis points to 15.7% in 2006, primarily due to growth in premium income, continued expense control and further leveraging of general and administrative costs over a larger membership base. In addition, the 2005 selling, general and administrative expense ratio was negatively impacted by $68.0 million, or 10 basis points, related to the MDL Agreement. 59 Table of Contents Cost of drugs increased $27.2 million, or 7%, to $414.4 million in 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to increased mail-order prescription volume by our PBM companies, partially offset by higher utilization of generic prescription drugs. Interest expense increased $177.3 million, or 78%, to $403.5 million in 2006, primarily due to additional interest expense on the debt incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of WellChoice. Amortization of other intangible assets increased $58.5 million, or 24%, to $297.4 million in 2006, primarily due to additional amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets with finite lives resulting from the acquisition of WellChoice. Income tax expense increased $393.0 million, or 28%, to $1.8 billion in 2006, consistent with the increase in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate in 2006 and 2005 was 37.0% and 36.7%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2006 was primarily related to increases in state taxes due to the addition of operations in New York following the acquisition of WellChoice. Reportable Segments The discussions of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 presented below are based on operating gain and operating margin, which are calculated as previously discussed. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our reportable segments’ results of operations for 2006 and 2005 have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation. CCB Our CCB segment’s summarized results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 ComparableBasisYear EndedDecember 31,2005 2006 2005 % Change $ Change % Change (In millions) Operating revenue $ 40,602.6 $ 32,182.7 26 % $ 37,346.7 $ 3,255.9 9 % Operating gain $ 3,679.5 $ 2,892.7 27 % $ 3,182.3 $ 497.2 16 % Operating margin 9.1 % 9.0 % 10bp 8.5 % 60bp Operating revenue increased $8.4 billion, or 26%, to $40.6 billion in 2006. On a comparable basis, operating revenue increased $3.3 billion, or 9%, primarily due to premium rate increases across all customer types and the addition of the New York state prescription drug contract. Operating gain increased $786.8 million, or 27%, to $3.7 billion in 2006. On a comparable basis, operating gain increased $497.2 million, or 16%, primarily due to disciplined pricing across all lines of business and continued expense control, the non-recurrence of $97.9 million in benefit and general and administrative expense recorded in 2005 related to the MDL Agreement, as well as the addition of the New York state prescription drug contract. These increases were partially offset by the impact of increased share-based compensation expense following the adoption of FAS 123R in 2006. The operating margin increased by 10 basis points from 9.0% in 2005 to 9.1% in 2006. On a comparable basis, operating margin increased 60 basis points in 2006. The 2006 operating margin included the impact of increased share-based compensation following the adoption of FAS 123R, as well as the impact of a business mix shift, including the addition of lower margin governmental business. The 2005 operating margin included the impact of the MDL Agreement. 60 Table of Contents 4SB Our 4SB segment’s summarized results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 ComparableBasisYear EndedDecember 31,2005 2006 2005 % Change $ Change % Change (In millions) Operating revenue $ 11,553.1 $ 8,427.6 37 % $ 9,376.6 $ 2,176.5 23 % Operating gain $ 1,117.0 $ 932.7 20 % $ 1,013.3 $ 103.7 10 % Operating margin 9.7 % 11.1 % (140 )bp 10.8 % (110 )bp Operating revenue increased $3.1 billion, or 37%, to $11.6 billion in 2006. On a comparable basis, operating revenue increased $2.2 billion, or 23%, primarily from increased premium revenue due to the introduction of Medicare Part D and increased prescription volume by our PBM companies including specialty pharmacy, partially offset by the sale of our workers compensation business in Wisconsin in 2005. Operating gain increased $184.3 million, or 20%, to $1.1 billion in 2006. On a comparable basis, operating gain increased $103.7 million, or 10%, primarily due to the introduction of Medicare Part D, increased prescription volume by our PBM companies and a change in estimate in noncurrent reserves for future policy benefits following the change of experience factors for waiver of premium reserves based on a 2006 group term life mortality study. These increases were partially offset by the sale of our workers compensation business in Wisconsin in 2005. Operating margin decreased 140 basis points from 11.1% in 2005 to 9.7% in 2006. On a comparable basis, operating margin decreased 110 basis points in 2006, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs.

On a comparable basis, operating revenue from external customers increased $544.2 million, or 11%, primarily due to higher premiums in FEP business. On both a reported and comparable basis, the elimination of intersegment revenue increased $263.3 million, or 22%, in 2006, reflecting additional sales of pharmacy products by our 4SB segment’s PBM companies to our CCB segment. 61 Table of Contents Operating loss decreased $33.3 million, or 36%, to $59.6 million in 2006. On a comparable basis, operating loss decreased $45.3 million, or 43%, primarily due to lower expenses related to retention bonuses and other compensation costs associated with the merger between the former Anthem, Inc. and the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc. IX. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider some of our most important accounting policies that require estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 included in this Form 10-K. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. Medical Claims Payable The most judgmental accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2007, this liability was $5.8 billion and represented 20% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 98%, or $5.7 billion, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2007; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 2%, or $106.2 million, of the total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2007. The level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period end to the next, from 1% to 5% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made. Liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical data of paid claims is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months (generally the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or “trend factors”. 62 Table of Contents Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison of prior year, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense. In addition to incurred but not paid claims, the liability for medical claims payable includes reserves for premium deficiencies, if appropriate. Premium deficiencies are recognized when it is probable that expected claims and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums on existing medical insurance contracts without consideration of investment income. Determination of premium deficiencies for longer duration life and disability contracts includes consideration of investment income. For purposes of premium deficiencies, contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. We regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each quarter and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that quarter. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable. While there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid liability as of December 31, 2007 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by other operational variables including system changes, provider submission patterns and business combinations. There is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through 12 months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. At December 31, 2007, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 50 and 120 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower variability ranging from 20 to 40 basis points. Over the period from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007, completion factors have decreased. With consideration of claim payments through December 31, 2007, the completion factors used to determine the incurred but not paid claim liability estimate for the December 31, 2006 valuation period have developed slightly lower than those used at December 31, 2006. This resulted in approximately $17.6 million of deficiency in the December 31, 2006 estimate and is included in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in completion factors has been taken into consideration when determining the completion factors used in establishing the December 31, 2007 incurred but not paid claim liability by choosing factors that reflect 63 Table of Contents the more recent experience. The difference in completion factor assumptions, assuming moderately adverse experience, results in variability of 4%, or approximately $217.0 million, in the December 31, 2007 incurred but not paid claim liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein. Over the period from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006, completion factors increased. With consideration of claim payments through December 31, 2006, the completion factors used to determine the incurred but not paid claim liability estimate for the December 31, 2005 valuation period have developed higher than those used at December 31, 2005, primarily because we received claims information from our providers more timely as a result of increased electronic submissions. In addition, we paid claims more quickly once they were received. This resulted in approximately $113.6 million of redundancy in the December 31, 2005 estimate and is included in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Over the period from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005, completion factors increased. With consideration of claims payment through December 31, 2005, the completion factors used to determine the incurred but not paid claim liability estimate for the December 31, 2004 valuation period have developed higher than those used at December 31, 2004, primarily because we are receiving claims information from our providers more timely as a result of increased electronic submissions. This resulted in approximately $194.3 million of redundancy in the December 31, 2004 estimate and included in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2005. The other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2007 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors used in determining the claims expense per member per month for the most recent two incurral months. At December 31, 2007, there was a 690 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors assuming moderately adverse experience. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 9%, or approximately $539.0 million, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factor used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claim liability at December 31, 2007. As we look at the year-over-year claim trend for the prior period (November and December 2006) compared to the current period (November and December 2007), the trend used in our reserve models has decreased. However, claim trends observed as of December 31, 2006 based upon subsequent claim runout were lower than anticipated in the assumptions used to estimate medical claims payable at December 31, 2006. This difference between the trend assumed in establishing the December 31, 2006 medical claims payable, and the trend observed based upon subsequent claims runout through the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, resulted in approximately $350.3 million of redundancy in the December 31, 2006 estimate and included in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. Claim trends observed as of December 31, 2005 based upon subsequent claim runout were lower than anticipated in the assumptions used to estimate medical claims payable at December 31, 2005. This decline was due to moderating outpatient service trends and declines in pharmacy benefit cost trend. This difference between the trends assumed in establishing the December 31, 2005 medical claims payable, and the trend observed based upon subsequent claims runout through the year ended December 31, 2006, resulted in approximately $504.1 million of redundancy in the December 31, 2005 estimate and included in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Over the period from 2004 to 2005, claim trends declined. Claim trends observed based upon subsequent claim runout were lower than anticipated in the assumptions used to estimate medical claims payable at December 31, 2004. This decline was due to moderating outpatient service trends and declines in pharmacy benefit cost trend. This difference between the trends assumed in establishing the December 31, 2004 medical 64 Table of Contents claims payable, and the trend observed based upon subsequent claims runout, resulted in approximately $450.6 million of redundancy in the December 31, 2004 estimate and included in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2005. As summarized below, Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides historical information regarding the accrual and payment of our medical claims liability. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements, the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years (redundancies)” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years (redundancies)” claims may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year”. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. We believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for unpaid claims liability at each reporting date. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 is as follows: Years Ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In millions) Gross medical claims payable, beginning of period $ 5,290.3 $ 4,853.4 $ 4,134.0 Ceded medical claims payable, beginning of period (51.0 ) (27.7 ) (31.9 ) Net medical claims payable, beginning of period 5,239.3 4,825.7 4,102.1 Business combinations and purchase adjustments 15.2 (6.4 ) 784.5 Net incurred medical claims: Current year 46,366.2 42,613.2 32,865.6 Prior years (redundancies) (332.7 ) (617.7 ) (644.9 ) Total net incurred medical claims 46,033.5 41,995.5 32,220.7 Net payments attributable to: Current year medical claims 40,765.7 37,486.0 28,997.1 Prior years medical claims 4,795.0 4,089.5 3,284.5 Total net payments 45,560.7 41,575.5 32,281.6 Net medical claims payable, end of period 5,727.3 5,239.3 4,825.7 Ceded medical claims payable, end of period 60.7 51.0 27.7 Gross medical claims payable, end of period $ 5,788.0 $ 5,290.3 $ 4,853.4 Current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net incurred medical claims 87.9 % 88.0 % 88.2 % Prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net medical claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current period 6.8 % 14.7 % 18.7 % Prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims 0.8 % 1.9 % 4.2 % Amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled. Liabilities at any period end are continually reviewed and re-estimated as information regarding actual claims payments, or runout, becomes known. This information is compared to the originally 65 Table of Contents established year end liability. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated. The prior year redundancy of $332.7 million shown above for the year ended December 31, 2007 represents an estimate based on paid claim activity from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007. Medical claim liabilities are usually described as having a “short tail”, which means that they are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the majority, or approximately 84%, of the $332.7 million redundancy relates to claims incurred in calendar year 2006, with the remaining 16% related to claims incurred in 2005 and prior. The ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 87.9% for 2007, 88.0% for 2006, and 88.2% for 2005. Comparison of the 2007 ratio of 87.9% and the 2006 ratio of 88.0% indicates fairly consistent payment patterns between 2007 and 2006. Comparison of the 2006 ratio of 88.0% and the 2005 ratio of 88.2% reflects a moderate decline due to system conversions and integration activity that impacted the 2006 ratio. We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current period in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. This metric was 6.8% for 2007, 14.7% for 2006, and 18.7% for 2005. As discussed previously, the 790 basis point decline in 2007 and the 400 basis point decrease in this metric for 2006 were caused by actual completion factors and claim trends differing from the assumptions used to support our best estimate of the incurred but not paid claim liability of the prior periods. We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation indicates the reasonableness of our prior year estimation of incurred medical claims and the consistency of our methodology. This metric was 0.8% for 2007, 1.9% for 2006, and 4.2% for 2005. This ratio is calculated using the redundancy of $332.7 million, shown above, which represents an estimate based on paid claim activity from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007. The 2006 ratio was impacted by having no net incurred medical claims for the former WellChoice, Inc. in 2005. If the former Wellchoice, Inc. had been included for the full year 2005, this ratio would have been approximately 1.6%. The 2005 ratio was impacted by having only one month of net incurred medical claims for WHN in 2004. If WHN had been included for the full year 2004, estimated prior year net incurred medical claims would have been $30,819.1 million, and the adjusted ratio would have been approximately 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in the above table for each of 2006 and 2005 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims—current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims—prior years (redundancies)” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 2006 2005 (In millions) Total net incurred medical claims, as reported $ 41,995.5 $ 32,220.7 Retrospective basis, as described above 42,280.5 32,247.9 Variance $ (285.0 ) $ (27.2 ) Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported (0.7 )% (0.1 )% Given that our business is primarily short tailed, the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2007 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2008. 66 Table of Contents The 2005 variance of $(27.2) million and variance to total incurred medical claims, as reported of (0.1)% was impacted by having no WellChoice, Inc. activity in the total incurred as reported during 2005 and full development of activity from the former WellChoice, Inc. in the retrospective basis amount. The adjusted variance would be approximately $(175.2) million and the variance to total incurred would be approximately (0.5)% if the impact of WellChoice was removed. The 2006 variance of $(285.0) million increased from the 2005 variance of $(27.2) million as a result of the addition of WellChoice in December 2005. The 2006 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of (0.7)% is fairly consistent with the adjusted 2005 ratio. These small variances to total net incurred medical claims, adjusted for the impact of WellChoice, show that our estimates of this liability have approximated the actual experience for the years depicted. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This standard requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance. At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following: • the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset; • the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim; • the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and • any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences. As discussed in the New Accounting Pronouncements disclosure included in this MD&A, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, or FIN 48, effective January 1, 2007. During 2007 and 2006, the valuation allowance changed by $(0.4) million and $0.5 million, respectively. This resulted from realized and unrealized capital losses of subsidiaries, which are not included in our consolidated tax return During the third quarter of 2006, we decreased our state deferred tax liability by $43.0 million, resulting in a tax benefit, net of federal taxes, of $28.0 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006. This resulted from a lower effective tax rate due to changes in our state apportionment factors following the WellChoice acquisition. During 2005, a refund claim we filed in 2003 was approved by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. The claim related to initially disallowed losses on the sale of certain subsidiaries in the late 1990s. A tax benefit of $28.4 million related to this claim was recorded in the first quarter of 2005. Net income related to this claim was $0.04 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2005. We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits. To the extent we prevail in matters we have 67 Table of Contents accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted. In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intend to defend our positions vigorously through the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, appeals process. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact to earnings from these matters. As of December 31, 2007, the IRS had completed its examination of our 2003 tax year. Our 2006, 2005 and 2004 tax years are being examined by the IRS. The IRS has invited us to join the Compliance Assurance Program, or CAP, for 2007, and we have accepted the invitation. The objective of CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the IRS of the accuracy of tax returns prior to filing, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations. Various tax examinations and proceedings also continue for certain subsidiaries for tax years prior to being included in our consolidated tax return. For additional information, see Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 included in this Form 10-K. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2007 was $13.4 billion and other intangible assets were $9.2 billion. The sum of goodwill and intangible assets represented 44% of our total consolidated assets and 99% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2007. We follow FAS 141, Business Combinations, and FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FAS 141 specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under FAS 142, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. We completed our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) for each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 and based upon these tests we have not incurred any material impairment losses related to any goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives). While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, the impairment testing required under FAS 142 requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our goodwill and intangibles (with indefinite lives). Such assumptions include the discount factor used to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, which is ultimately used to identify potential goodwill impairment. Such estimated fair values might produce significantly different results if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If we are unable to support a fair value estimate in future annual goodwill impairment tests or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income. For additional information, see Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 included in this Form 10-K. Investments Current and long term available-for-sale investment securities were $17.7 billion at December 31, 2007 and represented 34% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2007. In accordance with FAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, our fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as 68 Table of Contents “available-for-sale” or “trading” and are reported at fair value. We classify our investments in available-for-sale fixed maturity securities as either current or noncurrent assets based on their contractual maturity. Certain investments, which we intend to sell within the next twelve months, are carried as current without regard to their contractual maturities. Additionally, certain investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity. The unrealized gains or losses on both current and long-term available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders’ equity, unless the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and we do not have the intent and ability to hold such securities until their full cost can be recovered, in which case the securities are written down to fair value and the loss is charged to income. Investment income is recorded when earned, and realized gains or losses, determined by specific identification of investments sold, are included in income when the securities are sold. We maintain various rabbi trusts to account for the assets and liabilities under certain deferred compensation plans. Under these deferred compensation plans, the participants can defer certain types of compensation and elect to receive a return on the deferred amounts based on the changes in fair value of various investment options, primarily a variety of mutual funds. We also generally purchase corporate-owned life insurance policies on participants in the deferred compensation plans. The cash surrender value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies is reported in “Other invested assets, long-term” in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in cash surrender value is reported as an offset to premium expense of the policies, classified as general and administrative expense. In addition to available-for-sale investment securities, we held other long-term investments of $752.9 million, or 1% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2007. These long-term investments consist primarily of real estate, cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and certain other investments. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term. An impairment review of securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We evaluate our investment securities on a quarterly basis, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. If any declines are determined to be other-than-temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made. We have a committee made up of certain accounting and investment associates and management responsible for managing the impairment review process. The current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. We recorded charges for other-than-temporary impairment of securities of $259.7 million, $56.2 million, and $14.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. Other-than-temporary impairments on investments in 2007 and 2006 primarily related to our intent to hold fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position due to the prevailing interest rate environment, as well as other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities that had been in an unrealized loss position for an extended period of time. Impairments recorded in 2005 were primarily the result of the continued credit deterioration on specific issuers in the bond and equity markets. We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. This could result in realized losses relating to other-than-temporary declines being charged against future income. 69 Table of Contents A summary of available-for-sale investments with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2007 along with the related fair value, aggregated by the length of time that investments have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, is as follows: Less thanTwelve Months Twelve Monthsor More Total FairValue GrossUnrealizedLosses FairValue GrossUnrealizedLosses FairValue GrossUnrealizedLosses (In millions) Fixed maturity securities $ 2,502.2 $ (73.7 ) $ 2,254.0 $ (36.8 ) $ 4,756.2 $ (110.5 ) Equity securities 498.7 (69.2 ) — — 498.7 (69.2 ) Total $ 3,000.9 $ (142.9 ) $ 2,254.0 $ (36.8 ) $ 5,254.9 $ (179.7 ) Our fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, which impact the fair value of individual securities. Unrealized losses reported above were primarily caused by the effect of a rising interest rate environment on certain securities with stated interest rates currently below market rates. We currently have the ability and intent to hold these securities until their full cost can be recovered. Therefore, we do not believe the unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment as of December 31, 2007. A primary objective in the management of the fixed maturity and equity portfolios is to maximize total return relative to underlying liabilities and respective liquidity needs. In achieving this goal, assets may be sold to take advantage of market conditions or other investment opportunities as well as tax considerations. Sales will generally produce realized gains and losses. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold $8.1 billion of fixed maturity and equity securities which resulted in gross realized losses of $83.4 million. In the ordinary course of business, we may sell securities at a loss for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the investment environment; (ii) expectation that the fair value could deteriorate further; (iii) desire to reduce exposure to an issuer or an industry; (iv) changes in credit quality; or (v) changes in expected cash flow. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we sold $5.9 billion of fixed maturity and equity securities resulting in gross realized losses of $95.7 million. Subsequent to the acquisition of WellChoice, during 2006, we restructured our investment portfolios to align the merged portfolios with our overall investment guidelines. The majority of the sales of fixed maturity securities resulted in realized losses due to the prevailing interest rate environment. For equity securities, the 2006 sales to restructure the merged portfolios primarily resulted in realized gains. Similarly, subsequent to the merger with WHN, during 2005, we restructured our investment portfolios to align the merged portfolios with our overall investment guidelines. The majority of the sales of fixed maturity securities resulted in realized losses due to the prevailing interest rate environment. For equity securities, the 2005 sales to restructure the merged portfolios primarily resulted in realized gains. We participate in securities lending programs whereby marketable securities in our investment portfolio are transferred to independent brokers or dealers based on, among other things, their creditworthiness in exchange for collateral initially equal to at least 102% of the market value of the securities on loan and is thereafter maintained at a minimum of 100% of the market value of the securities loaned. The market value of the securities on loan to each borrower is monitored daily and the borrower is required to deliver additional collateral if the market value of the collateral falls below 100% of the market value of the securities on loan. The market value of the collateral amounted to $854.1 million and $904.7 million, which represented 103% and 103% of the carrying value at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Under guidance provided in FAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, we recognize the collateral as an asset, which is reported as “securities lending collateral” on our balance sheet and we record a corresponding liability for the obligation to return the collateral to the borrower, which is reported as “securities lending payable”. The securities on loan are reported in the applicable investment category on the balance sheet. Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage the market risks through our 70 Table of Contents investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits of investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future earnings and financial position. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $656.9 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $613.7 million increase in fair value. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $193.9 million. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $193.9 million. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, of this Form 10-K, and Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 included in this Form 10-K. Retirement Benefits Pension Benefits We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our employees. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FAS 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by FAS 87, we calculate the value of plan assets described below. Further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods. We will adopt the measurement date provisions of FAS 158 on December 31, 2008, using the alternative transition method. In lieu of re-measuring plan assets at the beginning of 2008, the alternative transition method allows for the use of the September 30, 2007 measurement date with net periodic benefit costs for the period from October 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 allocated proportionately between an adjustment of retained earnings (for the period from October 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007) and net periodic benefit cost for 2008 (for the period from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008). An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our September 30, 2007 measurement date, we selected a long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00% for all plans, which is consistent with our prior year assumption of 8.00%. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. The expected long-term rate of return is calculated by the geometric averaging method, which calculates an expected multi-period return, reflecting volatility drag on compound returns. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase. This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date (September 30, 2007). The selected discount rate for 71 Table of Contents all plans is 6.00% (compared to a discount rate of 5.90% for 2007 expense recognition), which was developed using a yield curve approach. Using yields available on high-quality fixed maturity securities with various maturity dates, the yield curve approach provides a “customized” rate, which is meant to match the expected cash flows of our specific benefit plans. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FAS 87. In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities, equity securities and alternatives across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow. As of our September 30, 2007 measurement date, we had approximately 60% of plan assets invested in equity securities, 36% in fixed maturity securities and 4% in other assets. No plan assets were invested in WellPoint common stock as of the measurement date. For the year ended December 31, 2007, no contributions were necessary to meet the Employee Retirement Income Securities Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, required funding levels; however, we made discretionary contributions totaling $8.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. For the year ending December 31, 2008, we do not expect any required contributions under ERISA; however, we may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. At December 31, 2007, our consolidated net prepaid pension asset was $411.7 million. We also had liabilities of $62.0 million for certain supplemental plans. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, we recognized consolidated pretax pension (credit) expense of $(12.9) million, $32.6 million, and $48.6 million, respectively. Other Postretirement Benefits We provide most associates with certain life, medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions including a discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits. We recognized a postretirement benefit liability of $500.7 million at December 31, 2007. We recognized consolidated pre-tax other postretirement expense of $36.3 million, $42.1 million and $26.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At our September 30, 2007 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 6.10% (compared to a discount rate of 5.90% for 2007 expense recognition). We developed this rate using a yield curve approach as described above. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of other benefits at our September 30, 2007 measurement dates was 8.50% for 2008 with a gradual decline to 5.00% by the year 2015. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2007 by $40.0 million and would increase service and interest costs by $1.9 million. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by $33.8 million as of December 31, 2007 and would decrease service and interest costs by $1.6 million. For additional information regarding retirement benefits, see Note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 included in this Form 10-K. 72 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement 109, or FIN 48. Among other things, FIN 48 provides guidance to address uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold which income tax positions must achieve before being recognized in the financial statements. In addition, FIN 48 requires expanded annual disclosures, including a rollforward of the beginning and ending aggregate unrecognized tax benefits as well as specific detail related to tax uncertainties for which it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007, and recorded a reduction of retained earnings of $1.6 million effective January 1, 2007. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions at January 1, 2007 was $884.0 million. See Note 2 and Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 included in this Form 10-K. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, or FAS 157. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. FAS 157 was effective for us on January 1, 2008. The adoption of FAS 157 did not have a material impact on our financial position or operating results. In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an Amendment of FASB Statement 115, or FAS 159. FAS 159 allows entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis under the fair value option. FAS 159 was effective for us on January 1, 2008. The adoption of FAS 159 did not have a material impact on our financial position or operating results. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141R, Business Combinations, or FAS 141R, and FAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51, or FAS 160. These new standards will significantly change the accounting for and reporting of business combinations and noncontrolling (minority) interest transactions completed after January 1, 2009. FAS 141R and FAS 160 are required to be adopted simultaneously and are effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. Early adoption is prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 141R and FAS 160 to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements; however, the adoption will impact the accounting for any business combinations completed after January 1, 2009. There were no other new accounting pronouncements issued during the year ended December 31, 2007 that had a material impact on our financial position, operating results or disclosures. X. Liquidity and Capital Resources Introduction Our cash receipts result primarily from premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on long-term borrowings, capital expenditures and repurchases of our common stock. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have some negative impact on our liquidity. 73 Table of Contents We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy. A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities, to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Excess capital at our subsidiaries is paid annually by subsidiaries in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. We have access to a $2.5 billion commercial paper program supported by a $2.5 billion senior credit facility, which allows us to maintain further operating and financial flexibility. Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 During 2007, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $4,344.6 million, compared to $4,044.2 million in 2006, an increase of $300.4 million. This increase resulted from improved net income in 2007. Net cash flow used in investing activities was $768.9 million in 2007, compared to $457.3 million of cash used in 2006. The table below outlines the increase in cash flow used in investing activities of $311.6 million between the two periods: Change inCash Used inInvestingActivities (In millions) Decrease in net purchases of investments $ 167.8 Increase in securities lending collateral (434.6 ) Increase in net purchases of subsidiaries (273.1 ) Increase in net purchases of property and equipment (77.2 ) Decrease in other, net 305.5 Net increase in cash used in investing activities $ (311.6 ) On August 1, 2007, we completed our acquisition of AIM for which we paid approximately $300.0 million in cash. 74 Table of Contents Net cash flow used in financing activities was $3,409.9 million in 2007 compared to cash used in financing activities of $3,725.0 million in 2006. The table below outlines the decrease in cash used in financing activities of $315.1 million between the two periods: Change inCash Used inFinancingActivities (In millions) Increase in net proceeds from commercial paper borrowings $ 808.8 Increase in net proceeds from long-term borrowings 962.5 Decrease in securities lending payable 434.6 Decrease in bank overdrafts (531.4 ) Increase in repurchases of common stock (1,601.2 ) Increase in proceeds from exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan 225.0 Increase in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation 16.8 Net decrease in cash used in financing activities $ 315.1 Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 During 2006, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $4,044.2 million, compared to $3,135.5 million in 2005, an increase of $908.7 million. This increase resulted from improved premium collections, and higher net income, including the impact of the acquisition of WellChoice, partially offset by higher tax payments. Net cash flow used in investing activities was $457.3 million in 2006, compared to $5,151.6 million of cash used in 2005. The table below outlines the decrease in cash flow used in investing activities of $4,694.3 million between the two periods: Change inCash Used inInvestingActivities (In millions) Decrease in net purchases of investments $ 1,441.8 Decrease in securities lending collateral 1,216.6 Decrease in net purchases of subsidiaries 2,471.5 Increase in net purchases of property and equipment (35.9 ) Increase in other, net (399.7 ) Net decrease in cash used in investing activities $ 4,694.3 The decrease in net purchases of investments resulted from the portfolio restructure in 2005 following the WHN merger, with lower amounts of restructuring in 2006 following the WellChoice acquisition. The decrease in securities lending collateral is consistent with the decrease in amounts outstanding under this program. The offset to the reduction of securities lending collateral is a reduction of securities lending payable, which is reported with cash used in financing activities. The decrease in net purchase of subsidiaries resulted from the WellChoice acquisition in 2005, with no corresponding acquisition during 2006. The increase in other, net includes the purchase of corporate-owned life insurance policies on participants in our deferred compensation plans. 75 Table of Contents Net cash flow used in financing activities was $3,725.0 million in 2006 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $3,299.1 million in 2005. The table below outlines the increase in cash used in financing activities of $7,024.1 million between the two periods: Change inCash Used inFinancingActivities (In millions) Decrease in net proceeds from commercial paper borrowings $ (1,114.2 ) Decrease in net proceeds from long-term borrowings (1,038.8 ) Decrease in securities lending payable (1,216.6 ) Increase in bank overdrafts 293.1 Increase in repurchases of common stock (4,216.8 ) Increase in proceeds from exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan 130.2 Increase in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation 136.5 Decrease in other, net 2.5 Net increase in cash used in financing activities $ (7,024.1 ) The decrease in net proceeds from commercial paper borrowings reflects repayment of commercial paper following our offering of senior unsecured notes in January 2006 as compared to net issuances of commercial paper in 2005 used to partially fund the WellChoice acquisition. The decrease in net proceeds from long-term borrowings was impacted by issuance of the bridge loan of $1,700.0 million in 2005, as compared to 2006 activity including our issuance of senior unsecured notes of $2,700.0 million in January 2006, repayment of the bridge loan in January 2006 and scheduled debt maturity of $450.0 million in July 2006. On January 10, 2006, we issued $700.0 million of 5.000% notes due 2011; $1,100.0 million of 5.250% notes due 2016; and $900.0 million of 5.850% notes due 2036 under a registration statement filed on December 28, 2005. The proceeds from this debt issuance were used to repay a bridge loan of $1,700.0 million and approximately $1,000.0 million in commercial paper borrowed to partially fund the December 28, 2005 WellChoice acquisition. Our securities lending payable declined during 2006, reflecting reduced amounts outstanding under the program. The offset to this is included in cash used in investing activities above. The increase in bank overdrafts reflects an increase in checks issued but outstanding at December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005. We increased our common stock repurchases during 2006, completing an additional $4,216.8 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. Financial Condition We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, of $21.2 billion at December 31, 2007. Since December 31, 2006, total cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, increased by $437.6 million as cash generated from operations was used for the repurchase of our common stock. Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. In addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in our California and Georgia subsidiaries. 76 Table of Contents At December 31, 2007, we held at the parent company approximately $2.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments, which is available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, share and debt repurchases and interest payments. Our consolidated debt-to-total capital ratio (calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt plus shareholders’ equity) was 28.2% as of December 31, 2007 and 22.2% as of December 31, 2006, which increased as a result of our $6.2 billion of common stock repurchases during 2007. Our senior debt is rated “A-” by Standard & Poor’s, “A-” by Fitch, Inc., “Baa1” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “a-” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. A significant downgrade in our debt ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs. Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity On August 21, 2007, we issued zero coupon notes in a private placement transaction exempt from registration. Gross proceeds to us were $500.0 million. The notes have a final maturity of August 22, 2022, and were issued with a yield to maturity of 5.264% and a final amount due at maturity of $1,090.0 million. The notes have a put feature that allows a note holder to require us to repurchase the notes at certain dates in the future. The proceeds of this debt issuance were for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, repurchasing shares of our common stock. The notes have initially been classified as long-term debt on our balance sheet, and will be reclassified to current portion of long-term debt beginning one year prior to the date we may be required to repurchase the notes. On December 28, 2005, we filed a shelf registration with the SEC to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt, capitalization of our subsidiaries or the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion. On June 8, 2007, we issued $700.0 million of 5.875% notes due 2017 and $800.0 million of 6.375% notes due 2037 under the shelf registration statement. The proceeds from this debt issuance were for working capital and for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, repurchases of our common stock. The notes have a call feature that allows us to repurchase the notes anytime at our option and a put feature that allows a note holder to require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of both a change of control event and a downgrade of the notes. On November 29, 2005, we entered into a senior revolving credit facility, or the facility, with certain lenders for general corporate purposes. We amended the facility on September 21, 2006. The facility, as amended, provides credit up to $2.5 billion (reduced for any commercial paper issuances) and matures on September 30, 2011. The interest rate on this facility is based on either (i) the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined percentage rate based on our credit rating at the date of utilization, or (ii) a base rate as defined in the facility agreement. Our ability to borrow under this facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2007 or during the year then ended. At December 31, 2007, we had $0.7 billion available under this facility. We have Board of Directors’ approval to borrow up to $2.5 billion under our commercial paper program. Proceeds from any issuance of commercial paper may be used for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of our debt and common stock. Commercial paper notes are short-term senior unsecured notes, with a maturity not to exceed 270 days from date of issuance. When issued, the notes bear interest at the then current market rates. There were $1.8 billion of borrowings outstanding under this commercial paper program as of December 31, 2007. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2007 are classified as long-term debt as our practice and intent is to replace short-term commercial paper outstanding at expiration with additional short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one year or with borrowings under our senior credit facility. 77 Table of Contents As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we are currently estimating approximately $3.3 billion of dividends to be paid to the parent company during 2008. During 2007, we received $4.4 billion of dividends from our subsidiaries. We maintain a common stock repurchase program as authorized by our Board of Directors. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. The repurchases are effected from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act, as amended. During the year ended December 31, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized increases of $9.5 billion in our stock repurchase program, resulting in a total amount available for repurchases in 2007 and thereafter of $10.4 billion, which included $0.95 billion of authorization remaining unused at December 31, 2006. During 2007, we repurchased and retired approximately 76.9 million shares at an average per share price of $79.99, for an aggregate cost of $6.2 billion. Therefore, as of December 31, 2007, we had $4.3 billion of authorization remaining under this program. Subsequent to December 31, 2007, we repurchased and retired approximately 15.0 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $1.2 billion, leaving approximately $3.1 billion for authorized future repurchases at February 12, 2008. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares because we believe it is a prudent use of surplus capital. Our current pension funding strategy is to fund an amount at least equal to the minimum required funding as determined under ERISA with consideration of maximum tax deductible amounts. For the year ended December 31, 2007, no contributions were necessary to meet ERISA required funding levels; however we made tax deductible discretionary contributions totaling $8.6 million during 2007. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2007 are as follows: Total Payments Due by Period Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 Years (In millions) Long-term debt, including capital leases1 $ 14,483.5 $ 2,206.4 $ 1,115.2 $ 2,565.9 $ 8,596.0 Operating lease commitments 888.0 150.7 244.0 177.6 315.7 Projected other postretirement benefits 923.5 41.4 188.3 189.9 503.9 Purchase obligations: IBM outsourcing agreements2 829.8 181.2 362.6 286.0 — Other purchase obligations3 424.6 86.1 144.0 142.5 52.0 Other long-term liabilities 921.1 — 357.6 343.6 219.9 Venture capital commitments 169.4 86.1 80.5 2.8 — Total contractual obligations and commitments $ 18,639.9 $ 2,751.9 $ 2,492.2 $ 3,708.3 $ 9,687.5 1 Includes estimated interest expense. 2 Relates to agreements with International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, to provide information technology infrastructure services. See Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 for further information. 3 Includes obligations related to non-IBM information technology service agreements and telecommunication contracts. The above table does not contain $815.3 million of gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities. See Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 for further information. 78 Table of Contents In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our credit agreement or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions. For additional information on our debt and lease commitments, see Notes 7 and 16, respectively, to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 included in this Form 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with an investment in a joint venture to develop and operate a well-being center in California, we may be required, based on specific targets, to make additional capital contributions up to $18.0 million. Approximately $8.3 million has been funded through December 31, 2007. The well-being center was completed and began operations during December 2006. For additional information on this off-balance sheet arrangement, see Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this Form 10-K. Risk-Based Capital Our regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies largely based on the NAIC’s RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under this Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our risk-based capital as of December 31, 2007, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, was in excess of all mandatory RBC thresholds. In addition to exceeding the RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries. XI. Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 This document contains certain forward-looking information about WellPoint that is intended to be covered by the safe harbor for “forward-looking statements” provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures in our SEC reports. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2007. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return. Investments Our investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk. The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit downgrade to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that downgrade. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately AA. Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which represent an exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value. 80 Table of Contents Our portfolio includes corporate securities (approximately 36% of the total fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2007), which are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. This risk is managed through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately A-. Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systematic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 89% of our available-for-sale investments were fixed maturity securities. Market risk is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $656.9 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $613.7 million increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly. Our available-for-sale equity securities portfolio, as of December 31, 2007, was approximately 11% of our investments. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $193.9 million. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $193.9 million. Long-Term Debt Our total long-term debt at December 31, 2007 was $9.0 billion, and included $1.8 billion of commercial paper. The carrying value of the commercial paper approximates fair value as the underlying instruments have variable interest rates at market value. The remainder of the debt is subject to interest rate risk as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2007, we had $7.1 billion of senior unsecured notes with fixed interest rates. These notes, at par value, included $300.0 million at 4.25% due 2009, $700.0 million at 5.000% due 2011, $350.0 million at 6.375% due 2012, $800.0 million at 6.80% due 2012, $500.0 million at 5.00% due 2014, $1,100.0 million at 5.250% due 2016, $700.0 million at 5.875% due 2017, $500.0 million at 5.260% due 2022, $500.0 million at 5.950% due 2034, $800.0 million at 6.375% due 2037 and $900.0 million at 5.850% due 2036. These notes had combined carrying and estimated fair value of $7.1 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Our subordinated debt includes surplus notes issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries. Par value of amounts outstanding at December 31, 2007 included $42.0 million of 9.125% surplus notes due 2010 and $25.1 million of 9.000% surplus notes due 2027. Any payment of interest or principal on the surplus notes may be made only with the prior approval of the Indiana Department of Insurance. The combined carrying value of the surplus notes was $66.7 million and $66.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The estimated fair value of the surplus notes exceeded the carrying value by $10.5 million and $13.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. 81 Table of Contents Derivatives We use derivative financial instruments, specifically interest rate swap agreements, to hedge exposure in interest rate risk on our borrowings. Our derivative use is generally limited to hedging purposes and we generally do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we entered into two fair value hedges with a total notional value of $440.0 million. The first hedge is a $240.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to receive a fixed 6.800% rate and pay a LIBOR-based floating rate and expires on August 1, 2012. The second hedge is a $200.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to receive a fixed 5.000% rate and pay a LIBOR-based floating rate and expires on December 15, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we entered into two fair value hedges with a total notional value of $660.0 million. The first hedge is a $360.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 6.800% rate for a LIBOR-based floating rate and expires on August 1, 2012. The second hedge is a $300.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 5.000% rate for LIBOR-based floating rate and expires December 15, 2014. Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these swap agreements. As of December 31, 2007, we recorded an asset of $41.0 million and a liability of $2.3 million, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swap’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $54.2 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $54.2 million increase in fair value. The unrecognized loss for all cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2007 was $8.0 million. As of December 31, 2007, the total amount of amortization over the next twelve months for all cash flow hedges will increase interest expense by approximately $0.8 million. 82 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:52:48.844429

Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Form 10-K. I. Executive Summary We are the largest health benefits company in terms of medical membership in the United States, serving 35.0 million medical members as of December 31, 2008. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or BCBS, licensee for: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (as BCBS in 10 New York City metropolitan and surrounding counties, and as Blue Cross or BCBS in selected upstate counties only), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield or Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield (in our New York service areas). We also serve customers throughout the country as UniCare. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states through our subsidiaries. Operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $61.6 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 2%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. These increases were primarily driven by premium rate increases for all medical lines of business, growth in our Medicare Advantage business and increased reimbursement in the Federal Employees Program, or FEP. These increases were partially offset by the loss of the New York State prescription drug contract, our exit from the Ohio Medicaid program, fully-insured membership declines in UniCare, National Accounts and Local Group businesses and the conversion of the Connecticut Medicaid program from fully-insured to self-funded. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $2.5 billion, a decrease of $854.7 million, or 26% over the year ended December 31, 2007. Our fully-diluted earnings per share, or EPS, for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $4.76, a decrease of $0.80, or 14%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. Included in 44 Table of Contents EPS for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1.45 per share loss from net realized investment losses, $0.17 per share loss from intangible asset impairments and $0.90 per share income from tax benefits, primarily from settlements with the IRS. Additionally, net income was influenced by higher medical costs in 2008, which are further described below. The decrease in EPS resulted from the impact of the items described above and was partially offset by the impact of our share repurchase program. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $2.5 billion or 1.0 times net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $4.3 billion or 1.3 times net income. The decrease in operating cash flow from 2007 was driven primarily by lower net income in 2008 compared to 2007, increases in accounts receivable and lower tax deductions related to reduced stock option exercises. The increase in accounts receivable was due to self-funded membership growth and higher amounts due from providers. The reduction in net income reflects higher medical costs. Operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $60.2 billion, an increase of $4.0 billion, or 7%, over the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating revenue increases were primarily driven by premium rate increases in Local Group, growth in our State-Sponsored business primarily due to the addition of five new states between the third quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, growth of our Medicare Advantage products and increased reimbursement in FEP. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $3.3 billion, an 8% increase over the year ended December 31, 2006. Our EPS was $5.56 for the year ended December 31, 2007, which included $0.01 per share from net realized investment gains, and was a 15% increase over the EPS of $4.82 for the year ended December 31, 2006, which included $0.04 per share in tax benefits resulting from a change in state tax apportionment factors. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $4.3 billion or 1.3 times net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $4.0 billion or 1.3 times net income. The increase in operating cash flow from 2006 was driven primarily by higher net income in 2007. We intend to continue expanding through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and capital transactions in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of the additional economies of scale provided by increased overall membership as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. While we have achieved strong growth as a result of strategic mergers and acquisitions, we have also achieved organic growth in our existing markets by providing excellent service, offering competitively priced products and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks. II. Overview Beginning January 1, 2008, we implemented a new organizational structure designed to support our strategic plan, which reflects how our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our business. As a result of this new organizational structure, we manage our operations through three reportable segments: Commercial; Consumer; and Other. Segment disclosures for 2007 and 2006 have been reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation. Our Commercial and Consumer segments both offer a diversified mix of managed care products, including preferred provider organizations, or PPOs; health maintenance organizations, or HMOs; traditional indemnity benefits and point-of-service plans, or POS plans; and a variety of hybrid benefit plans including consumer-driven health plans, or CDHPs, hospital only and limited benefit products. Our Commercial segment includes Local Group, National Accounts, UniCare and certain other ancillary business operations (dental, vision, life and disability and workers’ compensation). Business units in the 45 Table of Contents Commercial segment offer fully-insured products and provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers, including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management, disease management, wellness programs and other administrative services. Our Consumer segment includes Senior, State-Sponsored and Individual businesses. Senior business includes services such as Medicare Part D, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare Supplement, while State-Sponsored business includes our managed care alternatives for the Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Plan programs. The Other segment includes our Comprehensive Health Solutions Business unit, or CHS, that brings together our resources focused on optimizing the quality of health care and cost of care management. CHS includes provider relations, care and disease management, behavioral health, employee assistance programs, radiology benefit management, analytics-driven personal health care guidance and our pharmacy benefit management, or PBM, business, which includes NextRx, and our specialty pharmacy, PrecisionRx Specialty Solutions. Our Other segment also includes results from our Federal Government Solutions, or FGS, business. Our FGS business includes the FEP and National Government Services, Inc., or NGS, which acts as a Medicare contractor in several regions across the nation. The Other segment also includes other businesses that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, or FAS 131, as well as intersegment sales and expense eliminations and corporate expenses not allocated to the other reportable segments. Our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue comes from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. Administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, or where the fee is based on either processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized. Additionally, we earn administrative fee revenues from our Medicare processing business and from other health-related businesses including disease management programs, behavioral health, employee assistance programs, radiology benefit management and analytics-driven personal health care guidance. Other revenue is principally generated from member co-payments and deductibles associated with the mail-order sale of drugs by our PBM companies. Our benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. While we offer a diversified mix of managed care products, including PPO, HMO, POS and CDHP products, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products. Our selling expense consists of external broker commission expenses, and generally varies with premium volume. Our general and administrative expense consists of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Other costs are variable or discretionary in nature. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium, but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels, and thus associate compensation expense. Examples of discretionary costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity. 46 Table of Contents Our cost of drugs consists of the amounts we pay to pharmaceutical companies for the drugs we sell via mail order through our PBM and specialty pharmacy companies. This amount excludes the cost of drugs related to affiliated health customers recorded in benefit expense. Our cost of drugs can be influenced by the volume of prescriptions at our PBM companies, as well as cost changes, driven by prices set by pharmaceutical companies and mix of drugs sold. Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management programs. Several economic factors related to health care costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. While we price our business so that premium yield exceeds total cost trends, the potential effect of escalating health care costs as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material impact on our results of operations. III. Significant Events 2009 Bond Issue On February 5, 2009 we issued $400.0 million of 6.000% notes due 2014 and $600.0 million of 7.000% notes due 2019 under our shelf registration statement. The proceeds from this debt issuance are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, repayment of short-term debt and repurchasing shares of our common stock. The notes have a call feature that allows us to repurchase the notes at any time at our option and a put feature that allows a note holder to require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control event. Suspension by The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Over the past six months, we have been working with The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to resolve issues identified as a result of our internal compliance audits and findings from a recent CMS audit. Our work included detailed action plans to remediate such findings. Where appropriate, our proposed action plans have been reviewed and accepted by CMS. In addition, we engaged an independent third party to provide CMS with on-going assessments regarding our compliance, including verification of systems, processes and procedures. On January 12, 2009, CMS notified us that we were suspended from enrolling new patients in our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans until remediation efforts have been fully implemented and confirmed. This decision does not affect our current members enrolled in our Medicare products. We are continuing to work closely with CMS to implement the remediation efforts as expeditiously as possible. Stock Repurchase Program Under our Board of Director’s authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. The repurchases are effected from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired approximately 56.4 million shares at an average share price of $58.07, for an aggregate cost of $3.3 billion. As of December 31, 2008, $1.0 billion remained authorized for future repurchases. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired approximately 5.0 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $201.6 million, leaving approximately $820.6 million for authorized future repurchases at February 11, 2009. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares when we believe it is a prudent use of capital. 47 Table of Contents Tax Resolutions During the year ended December 31, 2008, we settled disputes with the IRS relating to certain tax years and industry issues which we had been discussing with the IRS for several years. Also relating to the industry issues that were settled, we recorded additional tax benefits that had previously been denied by the IRS. The above settlement and deductions, as well as changes in the composition of the apportionment factor in our combined state income tax returns, resulted in a tax benefit of $0.91 per basic share and $0.90 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, tax litigation in the U.S. Tax Court concluded adversely to us this year. The case has been appealed to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. Acquisition of Imaging Management Holdings, LLC On August 1, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Imaging Management Holdings, LLC, whose sole business is the holding company parent of American Imaging Management, Inc., or AIM. AIM is a leading radiology benefit management and technology company and provides services to us as well as other customers nationwide, including several other Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees. The acquisition supports our strategy to become the leader in affordable quality care by incorporating AIM’s services and technology for more effective and efficient use of radiology services by our members. The purchase price for the acquisition was approximately $300.0 million in cash. IV. Membership—December 31, 2008 Compared to December 31, 2007 Our customer type definitions were revised in the first quarter of 2008 in accordance with our new organizational structure, as described above. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation. Our medical membership includes seven different customer types: Local Group, Individual, National Accounts, BlueCard, Senior, State-Sponsored and FEP. BCBSA-branded business generally refers to members in our service areas licensed by the BCBSA. Non-BCBSA-branded business represents UniCare members predominately outside of our BCBSA service areas. • Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 1,000 employees eligible to participate as a member in one of our health plans, as well as customers with generally 1,000 or more eligible employees with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state. In addition, Local Group includes UniCare local group members. • Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 (including UniCare) and their covered dependents. • Beginning January 1, 2008, we revised our definition of National accounts to correspond with our new organizational structure. National Accounts customers now are generally multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in a WellPoint service area with 2,500 or more eligible employees, of which at least 5% are located outside of the headquarter state. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker relationships. Service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. • BlueCard host members represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by WellPoint who receive health care services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-WellPoint controlled BCBSA licensee (i.e., the “home” plan). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard claims received per month. 48 Table of Contents • Senior members are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a managed care alternative for the Medicare program, or who have purchased Medicare Supplement benefit coverage. • State-Sponsored membership represents eligible members with State-Sponsored managed care alternatives in Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance programs. • FEP members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some self-funded customers choose to purchase stop-loss coverage to limit their retained risk. 49 Table of Contents The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. Also included below are other businesses’ key metrics, including prescription volume for our PBM companies and other membership by product. The medical membership and other businesses’ metrics presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

The mail order script volume shown in the above table has been adjusted to reflect a 30 day supply. 50 Table of Contents Medical Membership During the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, total medical membership increased approximately 240,000, or 1%, due to increases in our National, Senior and FEP businesses, partially offset by declines in State-Sponsored, Individual and Local Group membership. Self-funded medical membership increased 783,000, or 4%, primarily due to an increase in self-funded National Accounts membership resulting from additional sales, BlueCard growth and Local Group growth and ongoing conversions to self-funded arrangements. Fully-insured membership decreased 543,000, or 3%, primarily due to declines in fully-insured Local Group membership, our exit from the Ohio Medicaid program and ongoing conversions to self-funded arrangements. Local Group membership decreased 31,000, or less than 1%, primarily due to the loss of 224,000 members in our UniCare business, partially offset by overall increases of 193,000 members in our BCBSA-branded business. Individual membership decreased 94,000, or 4%, with our UniCare business declining slightly more than BCBSA-branded business. The decline was due to competitive pricing pressures, competitive broker compensation in certain regions and overall economic conditions. National Accounts membership increased 331,000, or 5%, primarily driven by additional sales as employers are increasingly attracted to the benefits of our distinctive value proposition, which includes extensive and cost-effective provider networks and a broad and innovative product portfolio. These increases were partially offset by lapses and negative in-group-change due to the recent economic downturn. BlueCard membership increased 173,000, or 4%, primarily due to increased sales by other BCBSA licensees to accounts with members who reside in or travel to our licensed area. Senior membership increased 54,000, or 4%, primarily due to additional sales of our Medicare Advantage product, partially offset by a slight decline in Medicare Supplement membership. State-Sponsored membership decreased 206,000, or 9%, primarily due to our exit from the Ohio Medicaid programs. Other Membership Our Other products are often ancillary to our health business and can therefore be impacted by changes in our medical membership. Behavioral health membership increased 3,338,000, or 17%, primarily due to the conversion of 2,415,000 members from a third-party vendor in January 2008 and growth in membership due to new sales of our behavioral health products. Life and disability membership decreased 121,000, or 2%, primarily due to overall membership declines from a very competitive marketplace, reduction of members following employment declines at certain large customers and lapses due to the current economic environment. Life and disability membership is generally offered as part of Commercial medical fully-insured membership activity. Dental membership decreased 454,000, or 9%, primarily due to the loss of several large customers and sales continue to lag due to a slowing economy. Vision membership increased 213,000, or 9%, primarily due to continued market penetration of our Blue View Vision product. 51 Table of Contents Medicare Part D membership increased 256,000, or 16%, primarily due to growth from new sales during the 2008 marketing period. PBM Prescription Volume Prescription volume for paid scripts in our PBM companies increased by 16,426,000, or 7%. Paid script increases were primarily due to an increase in retail scripts resulting from higher membership, partially offset by lower utilization of our mail order business. The lower utilization of our mail order business resulted primarily from the introduction of four dollar generic drug programs offered by certain large retailers and the introduction of Zyrtec® as an over-the-counter drug. V. Cost of Care The following discussion summarizes our aggregate cost of care trends for the rolling 12 months ended December 31, 2008 for our Local Group fully-insured businesses only. As previously discussed, these costs are influenced by our mix of managed care products, including PPO, HMO, POS and CDHP products, in addition to changes in the unit costs and utilization levels. Our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing the year-over-year change in average per member per month claim costs, including member co-payments and deductibles. While our cost of care trend varies by geographic location, based on underlying medical cost trends during the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, our aggregate cost of care trend was less than 8%. Overall, our medical cost trend continued to be driven by unit costs. Inpatient hospital trend was in the very low double digit range and was related to increases in cost per admission. Higher average case acuity (intensity) was driving a portion of the acceleration in the cost per admission as was higher negotiated rate increases with hospitals. Re-contracting and clinical management efforts are serving to mitigate the inpatient trend increase. Key efforts in managing unit cost trends include enterprise-wide enhanced 360º Health care management programs as well as more focused review of neo-natal intensive care unit cases, spinal surgery cases and enhanced clinical management of chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease cases. During the second quarter of 2008 we signed an agreement with CareNex Health Services, a company that focuses on improving the lives of critically ill and critically-complex infants and their families. Inpatient utilization remains relatively flat compared to prior year while the average length of stay has decreased slightly. Cost trends for outpatient services were in the upper-single digit range. Outpatient costs are a collection of different types of expenses, such as outpatient facilities, labs, x-rays, emergency room, and occupational and physical therapy. The cost increases were primarily driven by higher per visit costs. Price increases within certain provider contracts as well as more procedures being performed during each visit, particularly emergency room visits, continued to increase per visit costs. We are continuing to develop plan designs and emergency room management programs to encourage appropriate utilization of outpatient services and we are seeing the positive impact of our expanding radiology management services through our AIM subsidiary. Incorporating their technology allows us to achieve even greater efficiencies in this high trend area while ensuring that consumers receive the quality tests they need, while improving patient safety. Physician services trend was in the mid-single digit range and was approximately 45% cost driven and 55% utilization driven. Increases in the physician care category were partially driven by fee schedule changes. We continue to collaborate with physicians to improve quality of care through pay-for-performance programs. Pharmacy trend was in the mid-single digit range and was approximately 60% unit cost (cost per prescription) related and 40% utilization (prescriptions per member per year) driven. The increased use of specialty drugs was a primary driver of the higher unit cost trend. Specialty drugs, also known as biotech drugs, are generally higher cost and are being utilized more frequently. Our new PrecisionRx Specialty Solutions pharmacy in Indianapolis, Indiana manages over 1,000 different drugs for 14 diseases including hemophilia, 52 Table of Contents multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, hepatitis C and cancer. We have built a technologically advanced specialty pharmacy staffed with certified pharmacy technicians, registered nurses and clinical pharmacists to better manage both the quality and cost of care for our members. The increases in cost per prescription measures are being mitigated by increases in our generic usage rates, benefit plan design changes, and improved pharmaceutical contracting. In response to cost trends, we continue to pursue contracting and plan design changes, promote and implement performance-based contracts that reward clinical outcomes and quality, and expand our radiology management, disease management and advanced care management programs. Expansion continues on 360º Health, the industry’s first program to integrate all care management programs and tools into a centralized, consumer-friendly resource. 360º Health assists patients in navigating the health care system, using their health benefits and accessing the most comprehensive and appropriate care available. In addition, we are broadening our specialty pharmacy programs and continuously evaluate our drug formulary to ensure the most effective pharmaceutical therapies are available for our members. VI. Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are discussed in the following section. Year Ended December 31 $ Change % Change 2008 2007 (In millions, except per share data) Premiums $ 57,101.0 $ 55,865.0 $ 1,236.0 2 % Administrative fees 3,836.6 3,673.6 163.0 4 Other revenue 641.6 617.0 24.6 4 Total operating revenue 61,579.2 60,155.6 1,423.6 2 Net investment income 851.1 1,001.1 (150.0 ) (15 ) Net realized (losses) gains on investments (1,179.2 ) 11.2 (1,190.4 ) NM 1 Total revenues 61,251.1 61,167.9 83.2 — Benefit expense 47,742.4 46,037.2 1,705.2 4 Selling, general and administrative expense: Selling expense 1,778.4 1,716.8 61.6 4 General and administrative expense 7,242.1 6,984.7 257.4 4 Total selling, general and Administrative expense 9,020.5 8,701.5 319.0 4 Cost of drugs 468.5 432.7 35.8 8 Interest expense 469.8 447.9 21.9 5 Amortization of other intangible assets 286.1 290.7 (4.6 ) (2 ) Impairment of intangible assets 141.4 — 141.4 NM 1 Total expenses 58,128.7 55,910.0 2,218.7 4 Income before income tax expense 3,122.4 5,257.9 (2,135.5 ) (41 ) Income tax expense 631.7 1,912.5 (1,280.8 ) (67 ) Net income $ 2,490.7 $ 3,345.4 $ (854.7 ) (26 ) Average diluted shares outstanding 523.0 602.0 (79.0 ) (13 ) Diluted net income per share $ 4.76 $ 5.56 $ (0.80 ) (14 ) Benefit expense ratio2 83.6 % 82.4 % 120 bp3 Selling, general and administrative expense ratio4 14.6 % 14.5 % 10 bp3 Income before income taxes as a percentage of total revenue 5.1 % 8.6 % (350 )bp3 Net income as a percentage of total revenue 4.1 % 5.5 % (140 )bp3 53 Table of Contents Certain of the following definitions are also applicable to all other results of operations tables in this discussion: 1 NM = Not meaningful 2 Benefit expense ratio = Benefit expense ÷ Premiums. 3 bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%. 4 Selling, general and administrative expense ratio = Total selling, general and administrative expense ÷ Total operating revenue. Premiums increased $1.2 billion, or 2%, to $57.1 billion in 2008, primarily due to premium rate increases for all medical customer types, growth in our Medicare Advantage business and increased reimbursement in the FEP program. These increases were partially offset by the loss of the New York State prescription drug contract, our exit from the Ohio Medicaid program, fully-insured membership declines in UniCare and National Accounts, the conversion of the Connecticut Medicaid program from fully-insured to self-funded in December 2007 and fully-insured membership declines in Local Group business. Administrative fees increased $163.0 million, or 4%, to $3.8 billion in 2008, primarily due to self-funded membership growth in National and Local Group and increased revenue for medical management programs offered by CHS. Self-funded membership growth was driven by successful efforts to attract large self-funded accounts and was attributable to our network breadth, discounts, service and increased focus on health improvement and wellness. Self-funded membership growth also increased due to the conversion of the Connecticut Medicaid program from fully-insured to self-funded in December 2007. These increases were partially offset by lower fees in our Blue Card business. Other revenue is comprised principally of co-payments and deductibles associated with the sale of mail-order prescription drugs by our PBM companies, which provide services to members of our Commercial and Consumer segments and third party clients. Other revenue increased $24.6 million, or 4%, to $641.6 million in 2008, primarily due to increased specialty prescription volume, partially offset by decreased mail order script volume. The lower utilization in our mail order business, as previously described, resulted primarily from the introduction of four dollar generic drug programs offered by certain large retailers and the introduction of Zyrtec® as an over-the-counter-drug. Net investment income decreased $150.0 million, or 15%, to $851.1 million in 2008 primarily resulting from reduced investment balances and lower yields on short-term investments during 2008. A summary of our net realized (losses) gains on investments for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 is as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 $ Change 2008 2007 (In millions) Net realized (losses) gains from the sale of fixed maturity securities $ (46.9 ) $ 11.5 $ (58.4 ) Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities 28.3 254.2 (225.9 ) Other-than-temporary impairments—equity securities (728.1 ) (104.5 ) (623.6 ) Other-than-temporary impairments—interest rate related fixed maturity securities (99.7 ) (146.4 ) 46.7 Other-than-temporary impairments—credit related fixed maturity securities (380.1 ) (8.8 ) (371.3 ) Other realized gains 47.3 5.2 42.1 Net realized (losses) gains $ (1,179.2 ) $ 11.2 $ (1,190.4 ) 54 Table of Contents Net realized losses in 2008 were primarily driven by other-than-temporary impairments related to the deterioration in equity markets and, to a lesser extent, other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities. Significant other-than-temporary impairments recognized for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $135.0 million, $106.6 million, and $90.2 million, respectively, for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., or Lehman (or their respective subsidiaries, as appropriate). Recent market concerns related to those entities’ financial condition and liquidity prompted the U.S. government to seize control of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and resulted in Lehman filing for bankruptcy protection. In addition, other-than-temporary impairments recognized for the year ended December 31, 2008 included charges for fixed maturity securities and equity securities for which, due to credit downgrades and/or the extent and duration of their decline in fair value in light of the current market conditions, we determined that the impairment was deemed other-than-temporary. These securities covered a number of industries, primarily led by the banking and financial services sectors. Net realized gains in 2007 were primarily driven by sales of equity securities at a gain, partially offset by interest rate related impairments of fixed maturity securities and other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within this MD&A for a discussion of our investment impairment review process. Benefit expense increased $1.7 billion, or 4%, to $47.7 billion in 2008, primarily due to overall higher medical costs in our Local Group fully-insured and Medicare Advantage businesses. The higher benefit expense in Local Group resulted from higher medical costs and less favorable prior period development, as well as membership changes, including lower fully-insured membership. Higher medical costs in Medicare Advantage resulted from both membership growth and increases in medical costs due to higher utilization resulting from adverse selection in certain of these products, which were caused by benefit design. We have addressed this matter for 2009 through pricing and benefit design changes. These increases were partially offset by the loss of the New York State prescription drug contract, the conversion of the State-Sponsored Connecticut Medicaid program from fully-insured to self-funded in December 2007, fully-insured membership declines in UniCare, our exit from the Ohio Medicaid program and fully-insured membership declines in National Accounts and Local Group businesses. Our benefit expense ratio increased 120 basis points to 83.6% in 2008, primarily due to higher medical costs in our Local Group fully-insured business, as well as higher medical costs in our Consumer segment. The benefit expense ratio in Local Group fully-insured business increased due to higher medical costs in certain geographies. The medical costs in our Consumer segment were primarily driven by Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D. As previously discussed, we are addressing these Medicare Advantage costs in 2009 by changing the benefit design. The increase in the benefit expense ratio related to our Medicare Part D business was driven by membership increases in 2008 as this business carries a higher benefit expense ratio than our overall company average. These overall increases in our benefit expense ratio were partially offset by the loss of the New York State prescription drug contract which had a higher than average benefit expense ratio. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $319.0 million, or 4%, to $9.0 billion in 2008, primarily due to higher salary and related benefits as a result of merit increases to employees, outside services, selling expense and severance, offset by lower incentive compensation costs. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio increased 10 basis points to 14.6% in 2008. The increase in our selling, general and administrative expense ratio was primarily due to the higher costs mentioned above offset by growth in operating revenue, which allows for leveraging of general and administrative costs over a larger revenue base, and lower incentive compensation costs. Cost of drugs sold increased $35.8 million, or 8%, to $468.5 million in 2008, primarily due to increased prescription volume in our specialty pharmacy companies. These specialty prescription drugs generally carry a higher cost than other prescription drugs. These increased costs were partially offset by decreased mail order script volume. 55 Table of Contents Interest expense increased $21.9 million, or 5%, to $469.8 million in 2008, primarily due to the issuance of $2.0 billion of long-term debt during 2007, partially offset by lower rates paid on our commercial paper and other variable rate debt. Amortization of other intangible assets decreased $4.6 million, or 2%, to $286.1 million in 2008, primarily due to reductions in amortization of certain intangibles acquired in prior years, partially offset by amortization of intangibles acquired with the AIM acquisition during 2007. During the third quarter of 2008, due to ongoing changes in the economic and regulatory environment in our State-Sponsored business, including California budgetary cuts, we revised our outlook for this business in certain states. This revision triggered an interim impairment review of our indefinite lived intangible assets related to State-Sponsored licenses in certain states, and we identified and recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $141.4 million during the third quarter of 2008. Income tax expense decreased $1.3 billion, or 67%, to $631.7 million in 2008, resulting from a combination of settlement of disputes with the IRS relating to certain prior tax years, lower state income taxes due to changes in the composition of the apportionment factors in our combined state income tax returns, settlements of disputes on state audits and lower income before income tax expense. The reduction in income before income tax expense included amounts recorded for other-than-temporary investment impairments and the impairment of certain intangible assets. The effective tax rates in 2008 and 2007 were 20.2% and 36.4%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2008 was primarily due to the settlement of outstanding IRS disputes. Our net income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 140 basis points, from 5.5% in 2007 to 4.1% in 2008. The decrease in this metric reflected a combination of all factors discussed above. Reportable Segments We use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, as described in FAS 131, which are Commercial, Consumer and Other. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, selling, general and administrative expense and cost of drugs. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, impairment of intangible assets or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. For additional information, see Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. The discussions of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our reportable segments’ results of operations for 2007 have been reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation. Commercial Our Commercial segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 $ Change % Change 2008 2007 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 38,009.3 $ 38,133.7 $ (124.4 ) 0 % Operating gain $ 3,281.3 $ 3,790.5 $ (509.2 ) (13 )% Operating margin 8.6 % 9.9 % (130 )bp 56 Table of Contents Operating revenue decreased $124.4 million, or less than 1%, to $38.0 billion in 2008, primarily due to the loss of the New York State prescription drug contract and fully-insured membership declines in Local Group, including UniCare, and National Accounts businesses, almost fully offset by premium rate increases in all medical lines of business. Operating gain decreased $509.2 million, or 13%, to $3.3 billion in 2008 due to higher benefit expense resulting from higher medical costs and less favorable prior period development, as well as membership changes in Local Group, including lower fully-insured membership. In addition, the decrease in operating gain reflects increased selling, general and administrative expense for compensation, selling and severance costs. The operating margin in 2008 was 8.6%, a 130 basis point decrease primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Consumer Our Consumer segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 $ Change % Change 2008 2007 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 16,437.3 $ 15,285.7 $ 1,151.6 8 % Operating gain $ 566.5 $ 777.2 $ (210.7 ) (27 )% Operating margin 3.4 % 5.1 % (170 )bp Operating revenue increased $1.2 billion, or 8%, to $16.4 billion in 2008, primarily due to growth in our Senior business, particularly in Medicare Advantage. These increases were partially offset by declines in operating revenue due to our exit from the Ohio Medicaid program and the conversion of the State-Sponsored Connecticut Medicaid business from fully-insured to self-funded in December 2007. Operating gain decreased $210.7 million, or 27%, to $566.5 million in 2008, primarily due to higher benefit expense within Medicare Advantage and lower margins in Medicare Part D business, primarily attributable to a higher percentage of dual eligible membership in 2008 than 2007. Higher benefit expense in Medicare Advantage was primarily due to higher utilization resulting from the benefit design of certain of these products which resulted in adverse selection. We have addressed this matter for 2009 through pricing and benefit design changes. The operating margin in 2008 was 3.4%, a 170 basis point decrease primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Other Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 $ Change % Change 2008 2007 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 7,132.6 $ 6,736.2 $ 396.4 6 % Operating gain $ 500.0 $ 416.5 $ 83.5 20 % 57 Table of Contents Operating revenue increased $396.4 million, or 6%, to $7.1 billion in 2008, primarily due to higher premiums in FEP business, as well as revenues generated by AIM, which was acquired in the third quarter of 2007. Operating gain increased $83.5 million, or 20%, to $500.0 million in 2008. This increase was due to improved results in our PBM and behavioral health businesses. PBM results improved due to higher retail sales and rebate retention which aligned with market rates. Results for our behavioral health business improved due to higher membership and improved administration rates. VII. Membership—December 31, 2007 Compared to December 31, 2006 The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. Also included below are other businesses’ key metrics, including prescription volume for our PBM companies and other membership by product. The medical membership and other businesses’ metrics presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

The mail order script volume shown in the above table has been adjusted to reflect a 30 day supply. Medical Membership During the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, total medical membership increased approximately 708,000, or 2%, primarily due to increases in National, including BlueCard, and State-Sponsored business partially offset by declines in Local Group and Individual membership. Self-funded medical membership increased 992,000, or 6%, primarily due to an increase in self-funded National Accounts membership resulting from additional sales and in-group growth, BlueCard growth and the conversion of 144,000 members from the Connecticut Medicaid managed care program from fully-insured to self-funded during the fourth quarter of 2007. Fully-insured membership decreased 284,000, or 2%, primarily due to Local Group decreases, including conversions to self-funded arrangements and in-group changes, as well as due to the conversion of the Connecticut Medicaid managed care program from fully-insured to self-funded. These decreases were partially offset by increases in State-Sponsored business, whose growth was driven by the addition of two new states during 2007 and growth in existing markets. Local Group membership decreased 103,000, or 1%, primarily driven by lapses and unfavorable in-group change in our non-BCBSA branded business. Individual membership decreased 98,000, or 4%, due to decreases in certain BCBSA-branded regions as well as in UniCare due to competitive pricing pressures and competitive broker compensation programs in certain regions. National Accounts membership increased 253,000, or 4%, primarily driven by in-group growth and additional sales as employers are increasingly attracted to the benefits of our distinctive value proposition, which includes extensive and cost-effective provider networks, wellness and care management programs and a broad and innovative product portfolio. BlueCard membership increased 284,000, or 7%, representing increased sales and corresponding claims by non-affiliated BCBSA licensees’ accounts with members who reside in or travel to our licensed area. Senior membership increased 57,000, or 5%, driven by growth in Medicare Advantage membership, partially offset by a slight decline in Medicare Supplement membership. State-Sponsored membership increased 292,000, or 16%, primarily due to the addition of 172,000 new members in two new states during 2007, as well as growth in existing programs. Other Membership Our Other products are often ancillary to our health business, and can therefore be impacted by growth in our medical membership. Behavioral health membership increased 3,293,000, or 19%, primarily due to the conversion of 2,882,000 members from a third-party vendor in April 2007 and growth in membership due to new sales of our behavioral health products. Life and disability membership decreased 372,000, or 6%, primarily due to a general decrease in both life and accidental death and disability membership, as well as membership changes at a large automotive customer. 59 Table of Contents Dental membership decreased 256,000, or 5%, primarily due to the loss of the dental component within one of our State-Sponsored plans and lapses due to a very competitive environment. Vision membership increased 865,000, or 56%, primarily due to the conversion of members over the last twelve months from a competing plan in Virginia to our Blue View Vision product as well as general growth of this new product. Medicare Part D membership increased 46,000, or 3%, primarily due to growth in the Medicare Part D benefit component of our Medicare Advantage products. PBM Prescription Volume Prescription volume for paid scripts in our PBM companies increased by 5,359,000, or 2%. Paid script increases were primarily due to an increase in retail scripts resulting from higher Medicare Part D utilization. VIII. Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are discussed in the following section. Year Ended December 31 $ Change % Change 2007 2006 (In millions, except per share data) Premiums $ 55,865.0 $ 51,971.9 $ 3,893.1 7 % Administrative fees 3,673.6 3,594.8 78.8 2 Other revenue 617.0 613.1 3.9 1 Total operating revenue 60,155.6 56,179.8 3,975.8 7 Net investment income 1,001.1 878.7 122.4 14 Net realized gains (losses) on investments 11.2 (0.3 ) 11.5 NM 1 Total revenues 61,167.9 57,058.2 4,109.7 7 Benefit expense 46,037.2 42,192.0 3,845.2 9 Selling, general and administrative expense: Selling expense 1,716.8 1,654.5 62.3 4 General and administrative expense 6,984.7 7,163.2 (178.5 ) (2 ) Total selling, general and administrative expense 8,701.5 8,817.7 (116.2 ) (1 ) Cost of drugs 432.7 433.2 (0.5 ) (0 ) Interest expense 447.9 403.5 44.4 11 Amortization of other intangible assets 290.7 297.4 (6.7 ) (2 ) Total expenses 55,910.0 52,143.8 3,766.2 7 Income before income tax expense 5,257.9 4,914.4 343.5 7 Income tax expense 1,912.5 1,819.5 93.0 5 Net income $ 3,345.4 $ 3,094.9 $ 250.5 8 Average diluted shares outstanding 602.0 642.1 (40.1 ) (6 )% Diluted net income per share $ 5.56 $ 4.82 $ 0.74 15 % Benefit expense ratio2 82.4 % 81.2 % 120 bp3 Selling, general and administrative expense ratio4 14.5 % 15.7 % (120 )bp3 Income before income taxes as a percentage of total revenue 8.6 % 8.6 % 0 bp3 Net income as a percentage of total revenue 5.5 % 5.4 % 10 bp3 60 Table of Contents Certain of the following definitions are also applicable to all other results of operations tables in this discussion: 1 NM = Not meaningful 2 Benefit expense ratio = Benefit expense ÷ Premiums. 3 bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%. 4 Selling, general and administrative expense ratio = Total selling, general and administrative expense ÷ Total operating revenue. Premiums increased $3.9 billion, or 7%, to $55.9 billion in 2007, driven by premium rate increases in Local Group, growth in our State-Sponsored business primarily due to the addition of five new states between the third quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, growth in Medicare Advantage business and increased reimbursement in FEP. Administrative fees increased $78.8 million, or 2%, to $3.7 billion in 2007, primarily due to self-funded membership growth in our National and BlueCard businesses. Self-funded membership growth was driven by successful efforts to attract large self-funded accounts and was attributable to our network breadth, discounts, service and increased focus on health improvement and wellness, as well as the success of the BlueCard program. Other revenue is comprised principally of co-payments and deductibles associated with the sale of mail-order prescription drugs by our PBM companies, which provide services to members of our Commercial and Consumer and third party clients. Other revenue increased $3.9 million, or 1%, to $617.0 million in 2007, primarily due to continued growth in specialty pharmacy prescription volume, partially offset by decreased prescription volume from third party customers in our mail-order PBM business. Net investment income increased $122.4 million, or 14%, to $1.0 billion in 2007 primarily resulting from higher yields and growth in invested assets driven by reinvestments of cash generated from operations. This growth was partially offset by the use of cash for repurchases of our common stock. A summary of our net realized gains (losses) on investments for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 is as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 $ Change 2007 2006 (In millions) Net realized gains (losses) from the sale of fixed maturity securities $ 11.5 $ (47.9 ) $ 59.4 Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities 254.2 98.5 155.7 Other-than-temporary impairments—equity securities (104.5 ) (29.8 ) (74.7 ) Other-than-temporary impairments—interest rate related fixed maturity securities (146.4 ) (23.7 ) (122.7 ) Other-than-temporary impairments—credit related fixed maturity securities (8.8 ) (2.7 ) (6.1 ) Other realized gains 5.2 5.3 (0.1 ) Net realized gains (losses) $ 11.2 $ (0.3 ) $ 11.5 Net realized gains on investments in 2007 were primarily driven by sales of equity securities at a gain, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities due to rising interest rates and impairments of equity securities. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in this MD&A for a discussion of our investment impairment review process. Net realized losses on investments in 2006 related primarily to other-than-temporary impairments and the sale of fixed maturity securities at a loss, partially offset by the sale of equity securities at a gain. 61 Table of Contents Benefit expense increased $3.8 billion, or 9%, to $46.0 billion in 2007, primarily due to higher cost in the Consumer segment and medical cost trend in the Commercial segment. Benefit expense for the Consumer segment increased primarily due to growth in State-Sponsored business with the addition of five new states between the third quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, as well as growth in our Medicare Advantage business. Benefit expense in the Commercial segment increased primarily due to medical cost trend in Local Group business. Lastly, continued increased trend in FEP business resulted in higher benefit expense, for which we are reimbursed for the cost plus a fee. Our benefit expense ratio increased 120 basis points to 82.4% in 2007, primarily related to the medical business of the Consumer segment including a business mix shift resulting from a decline in Individual membership. The increase in Consumer’s benefit expense ratio resulted from higher trend in State-Sponsored business and Medicare Advantage. The benefit expense ratio of State-Sponsored business was unfavorably impacted by a higher benefit expense ratio in the Ohio Medicaid program and the Connecticut Medicaid program in 2007 compared to the prior year. In addition, the Connecticut Medicaid program was fully-insured through November 30, 2007 and converted to self-funded business effective December 1, 2007. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $116.2 million, or 1%, to $8.7 billion, primarily due to lower salary and benefit costs including performance-based incentive compensation, partially offset by higher costs associated with growth of our business. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 120 basis points to 14.5%. This decrease in our selling, general and administrative expense ratio was primarily due to growth in operating revenue and further leveraging of general and administrative costs over a larger membership base. Cost of drugs decreased $0.5 million, or 0%, to $432.7 million in 2007. This decrease was primarily attributable to decreased PBM mail-order prescription volume from our third party customers and higher utilization of generic prescription drugs, partially offset by higher specialty pharmacy prescription volume. Interest expense increased $44.4 million, or 11%, to $447.9 million in 2007, primarily due to the issuance of approximately $2.0 billion of long-term debt in 2007. Amortization of other intangible assets decreased $6.7 million, or 2%, to $290.7 million in 2007, primarily due to certain intangibles amortizing on an accelerated amortization schedule over their estimated life, which resulted in greater expense in earlier periods. Income tax expense increased $93.0 million, or 5%, to $1.9 billion in 2007. The effective tax rate declined 60 basis points to 36.4% in 2007. The 2006 effective tax rate of 37.0% included a reduction of 60 basis points due to a $28.0 million tax benefit that was recognized in 2006 resulting from lower effective state tax rates. In addition, the 2007 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by various tax settlements. Our net income as a percentage of total revenue was 5.5% in 2007 compared to 5.4% in 2006, which reflects a combination of all of the factors discussed above. Reportable Segments The discussions of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 presented below are based on operating gain and operating margin, which is calculated as previously discussed. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our reportable segments’ results of operations for 2007 and 2006 have been reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation. 62 Table of Contents Commercial Our Commercial segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 $ Change % Change 2007 2006 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 38,133.7 $ 36,827.8 $ 1,305.9 4 % Operating gain $ 3,790.5 $ 3,457.3 $ 333.2 10 % Operating margin 9.9 % 9.4 % 50 bp Operating revenue increased $1.3 billion, or 4%, to $38.1 billion in 2007, primarily due to premium rate increases across all lines of business, partially offset by membership declines in Local Group and a shift in the mix of business from fully-insured to self-funded. Operating gain increased $333.2 million, or 10%, to $3.8 billion in 2007 driven by disciplined pricing as operating revenue growth outpaced increased benefit expense, primarily in Local Group. In addition, selling, general and administrative expense decreased in 2007 driven by lower performance-based incentive compensation. The operating margin in 2007 was 9.9%, a 50 basis point increase primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Consumer Our Consumer segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 $ Change % Change 2007 2006 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 15,285.7 $ 13,167.6 $ 2,118.1 16 % Operating gain $ 777.2 $ 1,022.2 $ (245.0 ) (24 )% Operating margin 5.1 % 7.8 % (270 )bp Operating revenue increased $2.1 billion, or 16%, to $15.3 billion in 2007, primarily due to growth in State-Sponsored business including the addition of five new states between the third quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, as well as growth in Medicare Advantage, Individual and Medicare Part D businesses. Operating gain decreased $245.0 million, or 24%, to $777.2 million in 2007, primarily due to deterioration in the performance of the State-Sponsored business and lower profitability in our Senior businesses. The deterioration in the performance of State-Sponsored business was driven by our Medicaid business in Connecticut and Ohio. The decline in profitability of our Senior business resulted primarily from our Medicare Supplement products, due to the aging of our member population in that business. The operating margin in 2007 was 5.1%, a 270 basis point decrease primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs coupled with a continuing shift in business mix, which includes growth in lower-margin State-Sponsored business. 63 Table of Contents Other Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 $ Change % Change 2007 2006 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 6,736.2 $ 6,184.4 $ 551.8 9 % Operating gain $ 416.5 $ 257.4 $ 159.1 62 % Operating revenue increased $551.8 million, or 9%, to $6.7 billion in 2007, primarily due to higher premiums in our FEP business. Operating gain increased $159.1 million, or 62%, to $416.5 million in 2007. This increase was primarily driven by growth in our PBM businesses, the non-recurrence of retention bonuses associated with the merger of the former Anthem, Inc. and the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc, growth in our behavioral health business and an improved operating gain in our FEP business. IX. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider some of our most important accounting policies that require estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Form 10-K. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. Medical Claims Payable The most judgmental accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2008, this liability was $6.2 billion and represented 23% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 98%, or $6.1 billion, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2008; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 2%, or $127.5 million, of the total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2008. The level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period end to the next, from 1% to 5% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made. Liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not 64 Table of Contents paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical data of paid claims is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months (generally the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or “trend factors”. Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison of prior year, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense. In addition to incurred but not paid claims, the liability for medical claims payable includes reserves for premium deficiencies, if appropriate. Premium deficiencies are recognized when it is probable that expected claims and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums on existing medical insurance contracts without consideration of investment income. Determination of premium deficiencies for longer duration life and disability contracts includes consideration of investment income. For purposes of premium deficiencies, contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. We regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each quarter and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that quarter. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable. While there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid liability as of December 31, 2008 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by other operational variables including system changes, provider submission patterns and business combinations. 65 Table of Contents There is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through 12 months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. In our analysis for the claim liabilities at December 31, 2008, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 80 and 160 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower variability ranging from 10 to 50 basis points. Over the period from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008, completion factors initially decreased, and then increased in more recent months. With consideration of claim payments during 2008, the completion factors used to determine the incurred but not paid claim liability estimate for the December 31, 2007 valuation period have developed slightly lower than those used at December 31, 2007. This resulted in approximately $120.3 million of deficiency in the December 31, 2007 estimate and is included in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in completion factors has been taken into consideration when determining the completion factors used in establishing the December 31, 2008 incurred but not paid claim liability by choosing factors that reflect the more recent experience. The difference in completion factor assumptions, assuming moderately adverse experience, results in variability of 4%, or approximately $277.0 million, in the December 31, 2008 incurred but not paid claim liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein. Over the period from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007, completion factors decreased. With consideration of claim payments through December 31, 2007, the completion factors used to determine the incurred but not paid claim liability estimate for the December 31, 2006 valuation period have developed slightly lower than those used at December 31, 2006. This resulted in approximately $17.6 million of deficiency in the December 31, 2006 estimate and is included in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in completion factors has been taken into consideration when determining the completion factors used in establishing the December 31, 2007 incurred but not paid claim liability by choosing factors that reflect the more recent experience. The difference in completion factor assumptions, assuming moderately adverse experience, results in variability of 4%, or approximately $217.0 million, in the December 31, 2007 incurred but not paid claim liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. Over the period from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006, completion factors increased. With consideration of claim payments through December 31, 2006, the completion factors used to determine the incurred but not paid claim liability estimate for the December 31, 2005 valuation period have developed higher than those used at December 31, 2005, primarily because we received claims information from our providers more timely as a result of increased electronic submissions. In addition, we paid claims more quickly once they were received. This resulted in approximately $113.6 million of redundancy in the December 31, 2005 estimate and is included in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. The other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2008 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. In our analysis for the period ended December 31, 2008, there was a 650 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors assuming moderately adverse experience. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 9%, or approximately $526.0 million, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factor used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claim liability at December 31, 2008. As we look at the year-over-year claim trend for the prior period compared to the current period, the trend used in our reserve models has decreased. However, claim trends observed as of December 31, 2007 based upon subsequent claim runout were lower than anticipated in the assumptions used to 66 Table of Contents estimate medical claims payable at December 31, 2007. This difference between the trend assumed in establishing the December 31, 2007 medical claims payable, and the trend observed based upon subsequent claims runout through the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, resulted in approximately $383.5 million of redundancy in the December 31, 2007 estimate and included in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2008. Claim trends observed as of December 31, 2006 based upon subsequent claim runout were lower than anticipated in the assumptions used to estimate medical claims payable at December 31, 2006. This difference between the trend assumed in establishing the December 31, 2006 medical claims payable, and the trend observed based upon subsequent claims runout through the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, resulted in approximately $350.3 million of redundancy in the December 31, 2006 estimate and included in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. Claim trends observed as of December 31, 2005 based upon subsequent claim runout were lower than anticipated in the assumptions used to estimate medical claims payable at December 31, 2005. This decline was due to moderating outpatient service trends and declines in pharmacy benefit cost trend. This difference between the trends assumed in establishing the December 31, 2005 medical claims payable, and the trend observed based upon subsequent claims runout through the year ended December 31, 2006, resulted in approximately $504.1 million of redundancy in the December 31, 2005 estimate and included in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. As summarized below, Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides historical information regarding the accrual and payment of our medical claims liability. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements, the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years (redundancies)” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years (redundancies)” claims may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year”. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. We believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for unpaid claims liability at each reporting date. 67 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 is as follows: Years Ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) Gross medical claims payable, beginning of period $ 5,788.0 $ 5,290.3 $ 4,853.4 Ceded medical claims payable, beginning of period (60.7 ) (51.0 ) (27.7 ) Net medical claims payable, beginning of period 5,727.3 5,239.3 4,825.7 Business combinations and purchase adjustments — 15.2 (6.4 ) Net incurred medical claims: Current year 47,940.9 46,366.2 42,613.2 Prior years redundancies (263.2 ) (332.7 ) (617.7 ) Total net incurred medical claims 47,677.7 46,033.5 41,995.5 Net payments attributable to: Current year medical claims 42,020.7 40,765.7 37,486.0 Prior years medical claims 5,259.9 4,795.0 4,089.5 Total net payments 47,280.6 45,560.7 41,575.5 Net medical claims payable, end of period 6,124.4 5,727.3 5,239.3 Ceded medical claims payable, end of period 60.3 60.7 51.0 Gross medical claims payable, end of period $ 6,184.7 $ 5,788.0 $ 5,290.3 Current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net incurred medical claims 87.7 % 87.9 % 88.0 % Prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net medical claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current period 4.8 % 6.8 % 14.7 % Prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims 0.6 % 0.8 % 1.9 % Amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled. Liabilities at any period end are continually reviewed and re-estimated as information regarding actual claims payments, or runout, becomes known. This information is compared to the originally established year end liability. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated. The prior year redundancy of $263.2 million shown above for the year ended December 31, 2008 represents an estimate based on paid claim activity from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008. Medical claim liabilities are usually described as having a “short tail”, which means that they are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the majority of the $263.2 million redundancy relates to claims incurred in calendar year 2007. The ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 87.7% for 2008, 87.9% for 2007, and 88.0% for 2006. Comparison of these ratios indicates fairly consistent payment patterns between 2008, 2007 and 2006. We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current period in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. This metric was 4.8% for 2008, 6.8% for 2007, and 14.7% for 2006. As discussed previously, the 200 basis point decline in 2008 and the 790 basis point decline in 2007 were caused by actual completion factors and claim trends differing from the assumptions used to support our best estimate of the incurred but not paid claim liability of the prior periods. 68 Table of Contents We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation indicates the reasonableness of our prior year estimation of incurred medical claims and the consistency of our methodology. This metric was 0.6% for 2008, 0.8% for 2007, and 1.9% for 2006. This ratio is calculated using the redundancy of $263.2 million, shown above, which represents an estimate based on paid claim activity from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008. The 2006 ratio was impacted by having no net incurred medical claims for the former WellChoice, Inc. in 2005. If the former Wellchoice, Inc. had been included for the full year 2005, this ratio would have been approximately 1.6%. The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in the above table for each of 2007 and 2006 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims—current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims—prior years (redundancies)” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 2007 2006 (In millions) Total net incurred medical claims, as reported $ 46,033.5 $ 41,995.5 Retrospective basis, as described above 46,103.0 42,280.5 Variance $ (69.5 ) $ (285.0 ) Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported (0.2 )% (0.7 )% Given that our business is primarily short tailed, the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2008 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2009. The 2007 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of (0.2)% is lower than 2006 due to more favorable developments impacting the 2006 reported incurred medical claims. These relatively small variances to total net incurred medical claims show that our estimates of this liability have approximated the actual experience for the years depicted. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This standard requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance. At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following: • the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset; • the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim; • the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and • any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences. 69 Table of Contents At December 31, 2008, we had deferred tax assets related to approximately $2.3 billion of tax basis unrealized losses on investment securities. Based on our intent and ability to hold certain securities until recovery or maturity, we expect a majority of these deferred tax assets to reverse over time as the related fixed maturity securities recover in value or approach their maturity date. For the deferred tax assets related to equity securities, we have the ability, if needed, to generate capital losses from the sale of those equity securities that can be carried back and offset prior period capital gains. We also expect to generate additional taxable gains in future periods from sales of securities currently held with unrealized capital gains. In addition, we have certain tax planning strategies that we believe will enable us to fully utilize all remaining deferred tax assets, if needed. Accordingly, we do not have any valuation allowance recorded as a reduction of these deferred tax assets at December 31, 2008. We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits, as required by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted. In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we intend to defend our positions vigorously through the federal, state and local appeals processes. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact on our results of operations from these matters. As of December 31, 2008, the examinations of our 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004 tax years are being concluded by the IRS. In addition, we have several tax years for which there are ongoing disputes related to pre-acquisition companies that are being concluded by the IRS. We joined the IRS Compliance Assurance Process, or CAP, in 2007 and continue to remain a participant. The objective of CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the IRS of the accuracy of tax returns prior to filing, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations. Various tax examinations and proceedings also continue for certain subsidiaries for tax years prior to being included in our consolidated tax return. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we settled disputes with the IRS relating to certain tax years and involving industry issues which we had been discussing with the IRS for several years. In certain years tax positions have been resolved but the overall tax year may require additional approval from the Joint Committee on Taxation before it can be finalized in total. As a result of this settlement, gross unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by $391.1 million and the consolidated results of operations were benefited by $289.5 million through a reduction in income tax expense. We recorded additional tax benefits in the amount of $35.1 million for intangible asset deductions and other various items. Our unrecognized tax benefits were $159.1 million at December 31, 2008. In addition, tax litigation in the U.S. Tax Court concluded adversely to us this year. The case has been appealed to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. While it is difficult to determine when a tax settlement will actually occur, it is reasonably possible that one should occur in the next twelve months and our unrecognized tax benefits could change within a range of approximately $0.0 million to $(70.0) million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we decreased our state deferred tax liabilities by $49.7 million, resulting in a tax benefit, net of federal taxes of $32.3 million. This resulted from a lower effective tax rate due to changes in the composition of the apportionment factors in our combined state income tax returns. 70 Table of Contents During 2008 and 2007, the valuation allowance decreased by $9.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The decrease in 2008 primarily resulted from the release of a state deferred tax asset valuation allowance for state net operating losses, changes in realized and unrealized capital losses of subsidiaries not included in our consolidated tax return, and changes in pre-acquisition companies’ valuation allowances related to goodwill adjustments. The decrease in 2007 resulted from realized and unrealized capital losses of subsidiaries not included in our consolidated tax return. During the third quarter of 2006, we decreased our state deferred tax liability by $43.0 million, resulting in a tax benefit, net of federal taxes, of $28.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006. This resulted from a lower effective tax rate due to changes in our state apportionment factors following the WellChoice acquisition. For additional information, see Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Form 10-K. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2008 was $13.5 billion and other intangible assets were $8.8 billion. The sum of goodwill and intangible assets represented 46% of our total consolidated assets and 104% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2008. We follow guidance provided by FAS 141, Business Combinations, and FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FAS 141 specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under FAS 142, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units in accordance with FAS 142 for purposes of the annual impairment test. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, including goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives. In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately. Fair value is calculated using a blend of a projected income and market value approach. The income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted average cost of capital and reflects volatility associated with the cost of equity capital. Market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including membership, revenue, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and net income as well as market capitalization analysis of WellPoint and other comparable companies. We completed our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) for each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 and based upon these tests we have not incurred any material impairment losses related to any goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives). The annual impairment tests are performed in the fourth quarter, and thus the 2008 test was performed after the impairments recognized in the third quarter as discussed in the following paragraph. During the third quarter of 2008, due to ongoing changes in the economic and regulatory environment in our State-Sponsored business, including California budgetary cuts, we revised our outlook for this business in those states. This revision triggered an interim impairment review of our indefinite lived intangible assets related to State-Sponsored licenses in certain states, and we identified and recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $141.4 million during the third quarter of 2008. These intangible assets are included in the Consumer segment and were valued using the income approach valuation method. In addition, we performed an impairment review of our goodwill balances during the first quarter of 2008 as a result of experiencing higher than anticipated medical costs, lower than expected fully-insured enrollment and the changing economic environment. No impairments were noted and no impairment charges were recorded. 71 Table of Contents While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income. For additional information, see Note 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Form 10-K. Investments Current and long term available-for-sale investment securities were $14.5 billion at December 31, 2008 and represented 30% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2008. In accordance with FAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, our fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as “available-for-sale” or “trading” and are reported at fair value. We classify our investments in available-for-sale fixed maturity securities as either current or noncurrent assets based on their contractual maturity. Certain investments, which we intend to sell within the next twelve months, are carried as current without regard to their contractual maturities. Additionally, certain investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity. The unrealized gains or losses on both current and long-term available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders’ equity, unless the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and we do not have the intent and ability to hold such securities until their full cost can be recovered, in which case the securities are written down to fair value and the loss is charged to income. Investment income is recorded when earned, and realized gains or losses, determined by specific identification of investments sold, are included in income when the securities are sold. We maintain various rabbi trusts to account for the assets and liabilities under certain deferred compensation plans. Under these deferred compensation plans, the participants can defer certain types of compensation and elect to receive a return on the deferred amounts based on the changes in fair value of various investment options, primarily a variety of mutual funds. We also generally purchase corporate-owned life insurance policies on participants in the deferred compensation plans. The cash surrender value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies is reported in “Other invested assets, long-term” in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in cash surrender value is reported as an offset to premium expense of the policies, classified as general and administrative expense. In addition to available-for-sale investment securities, we held other long-term investments of $703.2 million, or 1% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2008. These long-term investments consist primarily of real estate, cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and certain other investments. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term. We review investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. If any declines are determined to be other-than-temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made. We have a committee of certain accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. The current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. 72 Table of Contents We recorded charges for other-than-temporary impairment of securities of $1.2 billion, $259.7 million, and $56.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Significant other-than-temporary impairments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2008 included $135.0 million, $106.6 million and $90.2 million, respectively, for our investments in Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Lehman (or their respective subsidiaries, as appropriate). Recent market concerns related to those entities’ financial condition and liquidity prompted the U.S. government to seize control of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and resulted in Lehman filing for bankruptcy protection. In addition, other-than-temporary impairments recognized for the year ended December 31, 2008 included charges for fixed maturity securities and equity securities for which, due to credit downgrades and/or the extent and duration of their decline in fair value in light of the current market conditions, we determined that the impairment was deemed other-than-temporary. These securities covered a number of industries, primarily led by the banking and financial services sectors. Other-than-temporary impairments on investments in 2007 and 2006 primarily related to fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position due to the prevailing interest rate environment, as well as other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities that had been in an unrealized loss position for an extended period of time. We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. This could result in realized losses relating to other-than-temporary declines being charged against future income. Given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional, material other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods. A summary of available-for-sale investments with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2008 along with the related fair value, aggregated by the length of time that investments have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, is as follows: Less thanTwelve Months Twelve Monthsor More Total FairValue GrossUnrealizedLosses FairValue GrossUnrealizedLosses FairValue GrossUnrealizedLosses (In millions) Fixed maturity securities $ 4,944.7 $ (590.4 ) $ 940.5 $ (284.4 ) $ 5,885.2 $ (874.8 ) Equity securities 633.1 (234.8 ) — — 633.1 (234.8 ) Total $ 5,577.8 $ (825.2 ) $ 940.5 $ (284.4 ) $ 6,518.3 $ (1,109.6 ) Our fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, which impact the fair value of individual securities. Unrealized losses reported above were primarily caused by the effect of the interest rate environment and the widening of credit spreads on certain securities. We currently have the ability and intent to hold these securities until their full cost can be recovered. Therefore, we do not believe the unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment as of December 31, 2008. A primary objective in the management of the fixed maturity and equity portfolios is to maximize total return relative to underlying liabilities and respective liquidity needs. In achieving this goal, assets may be sold to take advantage of market conditions or other investment opportunities as well as tax considerations. Sales will generally produce realized gains and losses. In the ordinary course of business, we may sell securities at a loss for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the investment environment; (ii) expectation that the fair value could deteriorate further; (iii) desire to reduce exposure to an issuer or an industry; (iv) changes in credit quality; or (v) changes in expected cash flow. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold $6.3 billion of fixed maturity and equity securities which resulted in gross realized losses of $199.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold $8.1 billion of fixed maturity and equity securities 73 Table of Contents which resulted in gross realized losses of $83.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we sold $5.9 billion of fixed maturity and equity securities resulting in gross realized losses of $95.7 million. We participate in securities lending programs whereby marketable securities in our investment portfolio are transferred to independent brokers or dealers based on, among other things, their creditworthiness in exchange for cash collateral initially equal to at least 102% of the value of the securities on loan and is thereafter maintained at a minimum of 100% of the market value of the securities loaned (calculated as the ratio of initial market value of cash collateral to current market value of the securities on loan). Accordingly, the market value of the securities on loan to each borrower is monitored daily and the borrower is required to deliver additional cash collateral if the market value of the securities on loan exceeds the cash collateral delivered. The fair value of the collateral amounted to $529.0 million and $854.1 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The value of the cash collateral delivered represented 103% of the market value of the securities on loan at both December 31, 2008 and 2007. Under the guidance provided in FAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, we recognize the cash collateral as an asset, which is reported as “securities lending collateral” on our consolidated balance sheets and we record a corresponding liability for the obligation to return the cash collateral to the borrower, which is reported as “securities lending payable”. The securities on loan are reported in the applicable investment category on the consolidated balance sheets. Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage the market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits of investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future earnings and financial position. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $13.4 billion at December 31, 2008. The weighted-average credit rating of these securities was “AA” as of December 31, 2008. Included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities and corporate securities of $1.7 billion, $56.8 million and $7.7 million, respectively, that are guaranteed by third parties. With the exception of four securities with a fair value of $20.6 million, these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2008 with the guarantee by the third party. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities without the guarantee was “AA” as of December 31, 2008 for the securities for which such information is available. Fair values of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with FAS 157, Fair Value Measurements, or FAS 157. Third party pricing services normally derive the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. For securities not actively traded, the third party pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform monthly analysis on the prices received from third parties to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes a review of month to month price fluctuations and, as needed, a comparison of pricing services’ valuations to other pricing services’ valuations for the identical security. In certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. Such securities are designated Level III in accordance with FAS 157. Securities designated Level III at December 31, 2008 totaled $357.7 million and 74 Table of Contents represented 2% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level III securities primarily consist of certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities that were thinly traded during 2008 due to concerns in the securities markets and the resulting lack of liquidity. In addition, our Level III securities also include certain inverse floating rate securities that were not actively trading in their market. Consequently, observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using internal estimates for inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields. As a result, securities with a fair value of $632.7 million were transferred into the Level III balance during 2008. We recorded $45.6 million of realized losses on our Level III designated securities during the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of other-than-temporary impairments. During the fourth quarter of 2008, a portion of our securities that had been thinly traded during the earlier part of 2008 began actively trading and observable inputs used to determine the fair value of the securities became available. Therefore, securities with a fair value of $155.8 million were transferred from the Level III fixed maturity securities balance into the Level II fixed maturity securities balance at December 31, 2008. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $549.7 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $551.0 million increase in fair value. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $112.2 million. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $112.2 million. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, of this Form 10-K, and Notes 3 and 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Form 10-K. Retirement Benefits Pension Benefits We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our employees. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FAS 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions, as amended by FAS 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans – an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R), which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by FAS 87, we calculate the value of plan assets as described below. Further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods. We adopted the measurement date provisions of FAS 158 on December 31, 2008, using the alternative transition method. In lieu of re-measuring plan assets at the beginning of 2008, the alternative transition method allowed for the use of the September 30, 2007 measurement date with net periodic benefit costs for the period from October 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 allocated proportionately between an adjustment of retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (for the period from October 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007) and net periodic benefit cost for 2008 (for the period from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008). As a result, we recorded reductions to retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income of $1.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our December 31, 2008 measurement date, we selected a long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00% for all plans, which is consistent with our prior year assumption of 8.00%. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are 75 Table of Contents considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. The expected long-term rate of return is calculated by the geometric averaging method, which calculates an expected multi-period return, reflecting volatility drag on compound returns. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase. This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date (December 31, 2008). The selected discount rate for all plans is 5.64% (compared to a discount rate of 6.00% for 2008 expense recognition), which was developed using a yield curve approach. Using yields available on high-quality fixed maturity securities with various maturity dates, the yield curve approach provides a “customized” rate, which is meant to match the expected cash flows of our specific benefit plans. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FAS 87. In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities, equity securities and alternatives across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow. As of our December 31, 2008 measurement date, we had approximately 43% of plan assets invested in equity securities, 50% in fixed maturity securities and 7% in other assets. No plan assets were invested in WellPoint common stock as of the measurement date. For the year ended December 31, 2008, no contributions were necessary to meet ERISA required funding levels; however, we made discretionary contributions totaling $32.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. For the year ending December 31, 2009, we do not expect any material required contributions under ERISA; however, we may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. At December 31, 2008, our consolidated pension liabilities were $232.8 million, including liabilities of $62.1 for certain supplemental plans. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recognized consolidated pretax pension (credit) expense of $(27.0) million, $(12.9) million, and $32.6 million, respectively. Other Postretirement Benefits We provide most associates with certain life, medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions including a discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits. We recognized a postretirement benefit liability of $540.1 million at December 31, 2008. We recognized consolidated pre-tax other postretirement expense of $30.7 million, $36.3 million, and $42.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At our December 31, 2008 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 5.73% (compared to a discount rate of 6.10% for 2008 expense recognition). We developed this rate using a yield curve approach as described above. 76 Table of Contents The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of other benefits at our December 31, 2008 measurement dates was 8.00% for 2009 with a gradual decline to 5.00% by the year 2015. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2008 by $42.5 million and would increase service and interest costs by $2.5 million. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by $36.2 million as of December 31, 2008 and would decrease service and interest costs by $2.1 million. For additional information regarding retirement benefits, see Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Form 10-K. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, or FAS 157. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. FAS 157 was effective for us on January 1, 2008. The adoption of FAS 157 did not have a material impact on our financial position or operating results. In September 2006, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force finalized Issue No. 06-4, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements, or EITF 06-4. EITF 06-4 requires that a liability be recorded during the service period when a split-dollar life insurance agreement continues after participants’ employment or retirement. The required accrued liability is based on either the post-employment benefit cost for the continuing life insurance or based on the future death benefit depending on the contractual terms of the underlying agreement. We adopted EITF 06-4 on January 1, 2008. See Note 10, Retirement Benefits, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for discussion of the impact of adoption of EITF 06-4. In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an Amendment of FASB Statement 115, or FAS 159. FAS 159 allows entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis under the fair value option. FAS 159 was effective for us on January 1, 2008. The adoption of FAS 159 did not have a material impact on our financial position or operating results. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141R, Business Combinations, or FAS 141R, and FAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51, or FAS 160. These new standards will significantly change the accounting for and reporting of business combinations and noncontrolling (minority) interest transactions completed after January 1, 2009. FAS 141R and FAS 160 are required to be adopted simultaneously and were effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. The adoption of FAS 141R and FAS 160 effective January 1, 2009 did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements; however, the adoption will impact the accounting for any business combinations completed after January 1, 2009. In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. FAS 161 requires expanded disclosures regarding the location and amounts of derivative instruments in an entity’s financial statements, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, operating results and cash flows. FAS 161 was effective for us on January 1, 2009. The adoption of FAS 161 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 77 Table of Contents In January 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 99-20-1, Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20, or the FSP. The FSP amends the determination of when a decline in fair value of a purchased beneficial interest is considered other-than-temporary and more closely aligns the determination with the impairment model provided in FAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Accordingly, the FSP requires that an other-than-temporary impairment be recognized when it is probable that there has been an adverse change in the estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously projected. The FSP became effective retroactive to December 31, 2008. The adoption of the FSP did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. There were no other new accounting pronouncements issued during the year ended December 31, 2008 that had a material impact on our financial position, operating results or disclosures. X. Liquidity and Capital Resources Introduction Our cash receipts result primarily from premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on long-term borrowings, capital expenditures and repurchases of our common stock. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have some negative impact on our liquidity. We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy. A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities, to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. Recently, credit markets have experienced a tightening of available liquidity, primarily as a result of uncertainty surrounding mortgage-backed securities. In October 2008 the Federal government approved a bill that is aimed at addressing liquidity issues in the financial markets and is working to provide other initiatives designed to help relieve the credit crisis. In addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide liquidity and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions. We have a $2.5 billion commercial paper program. The commercial paper markets have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption, resulting in higher costs to issue commercial paper. As a result we recently reduced the amount of commercial paper outstanding, with $0.9 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2008 as compared to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2007. We continue to monitor the commercial paper markets and will act in a prudent manner. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we intend to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our $2.4 billion senior credit facility to redeem our commercial paper when it matures. While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we believe the lenders 78 Table of Contents participating in our credit facility will be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. In addition to the $2.4 billion senior credit facility, we expect to receive approximately $2.4 billion of ordinary dividends from our subsidiaries during 2009, which also provides further operating and financial flexibility. The table below outlines the cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,535.4 $ 4,344.6 $ 4,044.2 Investing activities 616.2 (768.9 ) (457.3 ) Financing activities (3,735.6 ) (3,409.9 ) (3,725.0 ) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (584.0 ) $ 165.8 $ (138.1 ) Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 During 2008, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion, compared to $4.3 billion in 2007, a decrease of $1.8 billion. This decrease resulted primarily from lower net income in 2008 compared to 2007, increases in accounts receivables and lower tax deductions related to reduced stock option exercises. The increase in accounts receivable was due to self-funded membership growth and higher amounts due from providers. The reduction in net income reflects higher medical costs. Net cash flow provided by investing activities was $616.2 million in 2008, compared to $768.9 million of cash used in 2007. The increase in cash flow provided by investing activities of $1.4 billion between the two periods primarily resulted from decreases in net purchases of investments, decreases in purchases of subsidiaries, and decreases in securities lending collateral, partially offset by increases in net purchases of property and equipment. Net cash flow used in financing activities was $3.7 billion in 2008 compared to cash used in financing activities of $3.4 billion in 2007. The increase in cash flow used in financing activities of $325.7 million primarily resulted from increases in net repayments of borrowings, including commercial paper, a decrease in securities lending payable, a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchase plan and a decrease in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, offset by decreases in the repurchase of common stock and an increase in bank overdrafts. Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 During 2007, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $4.3 billion, compared to $4.0 billion in 2006, an increase of $300.4 million. This increase resulted primarily from improved net income in 2007. Net cash flow used in investing activities was $768.9 million in 2007, compared to $457.3 million of cash used in 2006. The increase in cash flow used in investing activities of $311.6 million between the two periods primarily resulted from increases in securities lending collateral, increases in purchases of subsidiaries, and increased amounts for the purchase of property and equipment, partially offset by decreases in the net purchases of investments, including corporate owned life insurance. On August 1, 2007, we completed our acquisition of AIM for which we paid approximately $300.0 million in cash. Net cash flow used in financing activities was $3.4 billion in 2007 compared to cash used in financing activities of $3.7 billion in 2006. The decrease in cash used in financing activities of $315.1 million between the 79 Table of Contents two periods primarily resulted from increases in net proceeds from borrowings, including commercial paper, a decrease in securities lending payable and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchase plan, offset by increases in the repurchase of common stock and a decrease in bank overdrafts. Financial Condition We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, of $17.4 billion at December 31, 2008. Since December 31, 2007, total cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, decreased by $3.8 billion primarily due to repurchases of our common stock and declines in the fair value of certain investments as a result of the volatility experienced in the capital markets. Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. In addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in our California and Georgia subsidiaries. At December 31, 2008, we held at the parent company approximately $683.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and investments, which is available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, share and debt repurchases and interest payments. Our consolidated debt-to-total capital ratio (calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt plus shareholders’ equity) was 29.2% as of December 31, 2008 and 28.2% as of December 31, 2007. Our senior debt is rated “A-” by Standard & Poor’s, “A-” by Fitch, Inc., “Baa1” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. A significant downgrade in our debt ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs. Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity On February 5, 2009 we issued $400.0 million of 6.000% notes due 2014 and $600.0 million of 7.000% notes due 2019 under an updated shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on December 12, 2008. The proceeds from this debt issuance are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, repayment of short-term debt and repurchasing shares of our common stock. The notes have a call feature that allows us to repurchase the notes at anytime at our option and a put feature that allows a note holder to require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of both a change of control event and a downgrade of the notes. On December 12, 2008, we filed an updated shelf registration statement with the SEC to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt, capitalization of our subsidiaries, repurchases of our common stock or the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion. In September 2008, we became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, or FHLBI. As a member of the FHLBI, we have the ability to obtain cash advances from the FHLBI, subject to certain requirements. In order to obtain cash advances, we are required to pledge securities as collateral to the FHLBI, initially equal to a certain percentage of the cash borrowings, depending on the type of securities pledged as collateral. The market value of the collateral is monitored daily by the FHLBI, and if it falls below the required percentage of the cash borrowings, we are required to pledge additional securities as collateral or repay the outstanding cash advance balance. In addition, our borrowings cannot exceed twenty times our investment in 80 Table of Contents FHLBI common stock. Our investment in FHLBI common stock at December 31, 2008 totaled $5.0 million, which is reported in “Investments available-for-sale – Equity securities” on the consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2008, $98.0 million of cash advances from the FHLBI was outstanding and is reported in “Short-term borrowings” on the consolidated balance sheets. The interest rate on the outstanding cash advance balance at December 31, 2008 was 0.870%. Securities, primarily certain U.S. government sponsored mortgage-backed securities, with a fair value of $111.7 million at December 31, 2008 have been pledged as collateral. The securities pledged are reported in “Investments available-for-sale – Fixed maturity securities” on the consolidated balance sheets. On April 29, 2008, we borrowed $525.0 million under a three-year senior term loan agreement, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. The interest rate on this term loan is based on either (i) the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined percentage based on our credit rating, or (ii) the base rate as defined in the term loan agreement. On November 29, 2005, we entered into a senior revolving credit facility, or the facility, with certain lenders for general corporate purposes. The facility, as amended, provides credit up to $2.4 billion and matures on September 30, 2011. The interest rate on this facility is based on either: (i) the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined percentage rate based on our credit rating at the date of utilization, or (ii) a base rate as defined in the facility agreement. Our ability to borrow under this facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2008 or during the year then ended. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.4 billion available under this facility. We have Board of Directors’ approval to borrow up to $2.5 billion under our commercial paper program. Proceeds from any issuance of commercial paper may be used for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of our debt and common stock. Commercial paper notes are short-term senior unsecured notes, with a maturity not to exceed 270 days from date of issuance. When issued, the notes bear interest at the then current market rates. We had $0.9 billion of borrowings outstanding under this commercial paper program as of December 31, 2008. As previously discussed in “Introduction to Liquidity and Capital Resources”, the commercial paper markets have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. We will continue to monitor the commercial paper markets and will act in a prudent manner. We continue to classify our commercial paper as long-term debt given our intent to issue commercial paper or our ability to redeem our commercial paper using our $2.4 billion senior credit facility. As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we are currently estimating approximately $2.4 billion of dividends to be paid to the parent company during 2009. During 2008, we received $3.9 billion of dividends from our subsidiaries. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. The repurchases are effected from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. During 2008, we repurchased and retired approximately 56.4 million shares at an average per share price of $58.07, for an aggregate cost of $3.3 billion. As of December 31, 2008, we had $1.0 billion of authorization remaining under this program. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired approximately 5.0 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $201.6 million, leaving approximately $820.6 million for authorized future repurchases at February 11, 2009. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares when we believe it is a prudent use of capital. Our current pension funding strategy is to fund an amount at least equal to the minimum required funding as determined under ERISA with consideration of maximum tax deductible amounts. We may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For the year ended 81 Table of Contents December 31, 2008, no contributions were necessary to meet ERISA required funding levels; however, we made tax deductible discretionary contributions totaling $32.9 million to the defined benefit pension plans during 2008. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2008 are as follows: Total Payments Due by Period Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 Years (In millions) Long-term debt, including capital leases1 $ 13,764.8 $ 2,233.6 $ 1,905.1 $ 1,793.1 $ 7,833.0 Operating lease commitments 830.7 141.9 235.6 180.1 273.1 Projected other postretirement benefits 787.0 39.5 144.1 147.9 455.5 Purchase obligations: IBM outsourcing agreements2 877.4 218.1 508.9 150.4 — Other purchase obligations3 353.9 94.7 182.1 77.1 — Other long-term liabilities 1,044.8 — 408.7 402.3 233.8 Venture capital commitments 203.1 55.1 119.7 28.3 — Total contractual obligations and commitments $ 17,861.7 $ 2,782.9 $ 3,504.2 $ 2,779.2 $ 8,795.4 1 Includes estimated interest expense. 2 Relates to agreements with International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, to provide information technology infrastructure services. See Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Form 10-K for further information. 3 Includes obligations related to non-IBM information technology service agreements and telecommunication contracts. The above table does not contain $188.1 million of gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities. See Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Form 10-K for further information. In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our credit agreement or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions. For additional information on our debt and lease commitments, see Notes 12 and 17, respectively, to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Form 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that will require funding in future periods. Risk-Based Capital Our regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies largely based on the NAIC’s RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements 82 Table of Contents are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under this Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our risk-based capital as of December 31, 2008, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, was in excess of all mandatory RBC thresholds. In addition to exceeding the RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries.

As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2008. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return. Investments Our investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk. The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit downgrade to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that downgrade. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately “AA”. Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which represent an exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value. Our portfolio includes corporate securities (approximately 36% of the total fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2008), which are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. This risk is managed through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately “A-”. Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systematic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 92% of our available-for-sale investments were fixed maturity securities. Market risk is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $549.7 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $551.0 million increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly. Our available-for-sale equity securities portfolio, as of December 31, 2008, was approximately 8% of our investments. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, 84 Table of Contents would result in a fair value decrease of $112.2 million. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $112.2 million. Long-Term Debt Our total long-term debt at December 31, 2008 was $8.7 billion, and included $897.6 million of commercial paper and $498.8 million outstanding on a senior term loan. The carrying values of the commercial paper and senior term loan approximate fair value as the underlying instruments have variable interest rates at market value. The remainder of the debt is subject to interest rate risk as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2008, we had $7.3 billion of senior unsecured notes with fixed interest rates. These notes, at par value, included $300.0 million at 4.25% due 2009, $700.0 million at 5.000% due 2011, $350.0 million at 6.375% due 2012, $800.0 million at 6.80% due 2012, $500.0 million at 5.00% due 2014, $1,100.0 million at 5.250% due 2016, $700.0 million at 5.875% due 2017, $1,090.0 million at 5.264% due 2022, $500.0 million at 5.950% due 2034, $900.0 million at 5.850% due 2036, and $800.0 million at 6.375% due 2037. These notes had combined carrying and estimated fair value of $7.3 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2008. Our subordinated debt includes surplus notes issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries. Par value of amounts outstanding at December 31, 2008 included $42.0 million of 9.125% surplus notes due 2010 and $25.1 million of 9.000% surplus notes due 2027. Any payment of interest or principal on the surplus notes may be made only with the prior approval of the Indiana Department of Insurance. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the surplus notes were $66.7 million and $66.6 million at December 31, 2008 Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. Derivatives We use derivative financial instruments, specifically interest rate swap agreements, to hedge exposure in interest rate risk on our borrowings. These derivatives are also subject to credit quality risk from the counterparty. Our derivative use is generally limited to hedging purposes and we generally do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we terminated two interest rate swaps of our fixed rate debt for which the counterparty was Lehman. Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection on September 15, 2008. We recognized a $2.1 million impairment of these fair value hedges as net realized losses on investments during the year ended December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we entered into two fair value hedges with a total notional value of $440.0 million. The first hedge is a $240.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to receive a fixed 6.800% rate and pay a LIBOR-based floating rate and expires on August 1, 2012. The second hedge is a $200.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to receive a fixed 5.000% rate and pay a LIBOR-based floating rate and expires on December 15, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we entered into two fair value hedges with a total notional value of $660.0 million. The first hedge is a $360.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 6.800% rate for a LIBOR-based floating rate and expires on August 1, 2012. The second hedge is a $300.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 5.000% rate for LIBOR-based floating rate and expires December 15, 2014. 85 Table of Contents Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these swap agreements. As of December 31, 2008, we recorded an asset of $122.1 million, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swap’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $42.7 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $42.7 million increase in fair value. The unrecognized loss for all cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2008 was $8.5 million. As of December 31, 2008, the total amount of amortization over the next twelve months for all cash flow hedges will decrease interest expense by approximately $0.4 million. 86 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:52:58.218097

References to the terms “we”, “our”, or “us” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, refer to WellPoint, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries.

Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009, included in this Form 10-K. I. Executive Summary We are the largest health benefits company in terms of medical membership in the United States, serving 33.7 million medical members as of December 31, 2009. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or BCBS, licensee for: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (as BCBS in 10 New York City metropolitan and surrounding counties, and as Blue Cross or BCBS in selected upstate counties only), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield or Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield (in our New York service areas). We also serve customers throughout much of the country as UniCare. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states through our subsidiaries. Operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $60.8 billion, a decrease of $0.8 billion, or 1%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by fully-insured membership declines across our Commercial and Consumer businesses resulting from the current economic conditions, as well as our strategic withdrawal from certain State-Sponsored programs. These decreases were partially offset by premium rate increases for all medical lines of business and increased reimbursement in the Federal Employees Program, or FEP. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $4.7 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion, or 91% over the year ended December 31, 2008. Our fully-diluted earnings per share, or EPS, for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $9.88, an increase of $5.12, or 108% over the year ended December 31, 2008. Our fully-diluted shares were 480.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of 42.5 million, or 8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. 45 Table of Contents The results included the following after-tax items: For the year ended December 31, 2009—net income of $4.7 billion or EPS of $9.88 • Gain on sale of our prescription benefits management, or PBM business, of $2.4 billion or EPS of $4.91 • Other-than-temporary impairment losses, net of realized gains on investments of $(255.2) million or EPS of $(0.53) • Restructuring charges net of other items of $(102.3) million or EPS of $(0.21) • Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets of $(184.6) million or EPS of $(0.38) For the year ended December 31, 2008—net income of $2.5 billion or EPS of $4.76 • Other-than-temporary impairment losses, net of realized gains on investments of $(759.6) million or EPS of $(1.45) • Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets of $(90.8) million or EPS of $(0.17) • Income tax benefits from favorable resolution of certain federal and state tax matters of $473.0 million or EPS of $0.90 See “Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008” included in this MD&A for further discussion of our operating results for these two years. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $3.0 billion or 0.6 times net income, which was driven by the gain on sale of our PBM business and is included in investing cash flow. Excluding the after-tax impact of the gain on sale of our PBM business from net income, operating cash flow was 1.3 times net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $2.5 billion or 1.0 times net income. The increase in operating cash flow from 2008 was driven primarily by the favorable net change in provider advances, decreased tax payments, lower experience-rated refunds to certain large customers and decreased incentive payments. These favorable operating cash flow drivers were partially offset by unfavorable operating cash flows related to the transitioning of the PBM business to Express Scripts, higher discretionary benefit plan contributions and the delay in receipt of certain State-Sponsored business premiums until early 2010. We intend to continue expanding through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and capital transactions in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. While we have achieved strong growth as a result of strategic mergers and acquisitions, we have also achieved organic growth in our existing markets over time by providing excellent service, offering competitively priced products and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks. II. Overview We manage our operations through three reportable segments: Commercial, Consumer, and Other. Segment disclosures for 2007 have been reclassified to conform to the 2009 and 2008 presentation. Our Commercial and Consumer segments both offer a diversified mix of managed care products, including preferred provider organizations, or PPOs; health maintenance organizations, or HMOs; traditional indemnity benefits and point-of-service plans, or POS plans; and a variety of hybrid benefit plans including consumer-driven health plans, or CDHPs, hospital only and limited benefit products. Our Commercial segment includes Local Group (including UniCare), National Accounts and certain other ancillary business operations (dental, vision, life and disability and workers’ compensation). Business units in the 46 Table of Contents Commercial segment offer fully-insured products and provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers, including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management, disease management, wellness programs and other administrative services. Our Consumer segment includes Senior, State-Sponsored and Individual businesses. Senior business includes services such as Medicare Part D, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare Supplement, while State-Sponsored business includes our managed care alternatives for the Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Plan programs. The Other segment includes our Comprehensive Health Solutions Business unit, or CHS, that brings together our resources focused on optimizing the quality of health care and cost of care management. CHS included our PBM business until its sale to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009, and also includes provider relations, care and disease management, employee assistance programs, including behavioral health, radiology benefit management and analytics-driven personal healthcare guidance. Our Other segment also includes results from our Federal Government Solutions, or FGS, business. FGS business includes the FEP and National Government Services, Inc., or NGS, which acts as a Medicare contractor in several regions across the nation. The Other segment also includes other businesses that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment as defined in Financial Accouting Standards Board, or FASB, guidance for disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information, as well as intersegment sales and expense eliminations and corporate expenses not allocated to the other reportable segments. Our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue comes from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. Administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, or where the fee is based on either processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized. Additionally, we earn administrative fee revenues from our Medicare processing business and from other health-related businesses including disease management programs. Other revenue is principally generated from member co-payments and deductibles associated with the mail-order sale of drugs by our PBM business prior to its sale on December 1, 2009. Our benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. While we offer a diversified mix of managed care products, including PPO, HMO, POS and CDHP products, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products. In recent periods, we have seen an increase in COBRA coverage within these product offerings that can further impact our cost of care. COBRA is named for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, which provides unemployed group members with coverage for up to 18 months after losing their job. On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or ARRA, was signed into law. ARRA provides for a temporary subsidy of COBRA premiums for individuals that were involuntarily terminated from employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct) between September 1, 2008 and February 28, 2010. There have also been discussions among lawmakers regarding extension of ARRA through December 31, 2010. The COBRA subsidy under ARRA has caused more individuals to elect COBRA coverage. Our selling expense consists of external broker commission expenses, and generally varies with premium or membership volume. Our general and administrative expense consists of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Other costs are variable or discretionary in nature. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Other variable 47 Table of Contents costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium, but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels, and thus associate compensation expense. Examples of discretionary costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity. Our cost of drugs consists of the amounts we pay to pharmaceutical companies for the drugs we sold via mail order through our PBM and specialty pharmacy companies until their sale to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009. This amount excludes the cost of drugs related to affiliated health customers recorded in benefit expense. Our cost of drugs was influenced by the volume of prescriptions at our PBM companies until the sale to Express Scripts, as well as cost changes, driven by prices set by pharmaceutical companies and mix of drugs sold. Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management programs. Several economic factors related to health care costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. While we price our business so that premium yield exceeds total cost trends, the potential effect of escalating health care costs as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material impact on our results of operations. Our future results of operations may also be impacted by certain external forces and resulting changes in our business model and strategy. During 2009, the U.S. Congress proposed several new pieces of legislation aimed at reforming the U.S. health care system. The proposals vary widely and encompass certain new taxes and fees, including an excise tax on high value insurance policies and new fees on companies in our industry which may not be deductible for income tax purposes, as well as the establishment of a public health insurance plan that would compete with private health insurance plans, guaranteed coverage requirements, establishment of minimum loss ratio requirements and greater limitations on premiums we could charge. In addition, there are numerous other provisions and proposals being considered in Congress and at the state level that could impact our operations and financial results. None of these proposals have yet been enacted; however, certain of the provisions could have a material adverse effect on our business model and results of operations. Also see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. In addition to external forces discussed in the preceding paragraph, our results of operations are impacted by levels and mix of membership. During 2009, we experienced both fully-insured and self-funded membership declines. Given the current economic conditions in the U.S., it is expected that unemployment levels will remain high throughout 2010, which may impact our ability to increase or even maintain current membership levels. These membership trends could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Also see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. Partially in response to these factors, we continue to review our business model and explore various cost reduction activities to make us more efficient and effective. As a result of strategic actions we are taking to achieve this objective, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $171.6 million for restructuring costs during the fourth quarter of 2009. The outcomes of these initiatives are anticipated to benefit us in the future. III. Significant Events Sale of PBM Business On December 1, 2009, we sold our PBM business to Express Scripts and received $4.7 billion in cash. The pre-tax and after-tax gains on the sale were $3.8 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. During the first quarter of 2010, we will make tax payments of approximately $1.2 billion relating to the PBM sale. We also entered into a 10-year contract for Express Scripts to provide PBM services to our members. We expect this alliance to provide 48 Table of Contents our members with more cost effective solutions as well as access to state-of-the-art PBM services. The results of operations of our PBM business have been included in our consolidated results through November 30, 2009. Announcement of Member Transition Agreement for UniCare Business On October 28, 2009, we announced that we entered into a member transition agreement with Health Care Service Corporation, or HCSC, which operates as Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Illinois and Texas. Under this agreement, HCSC will offer guaranteed replacement coverage to our UniCare commercial group and individual members in those states. Starting on January 1, 2010, certain of our membership began transitioning to HCSC as a result of this agreement and we expect them to experience significant benefits, including gaining access to HCSC’s extensive provider networks and leading discounts. The member transition agreement did not have a material effect on our consolidated cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. Acquisition of DeCare Dental, LLC On April 9, 2009, we completed our acquisition of DeCare Dental, LLC, or DeCare, a wholly-owned subsidiary of DeCare International. DeCare is one of the country’s largest administrators of dental benefit plans and provides services directly and through partnerships and administrative agreements with ten dental insurance brands, primarily as a third party administrator. DeCare manages benefits for approximately four million people and is expected to provide our customers with innovative dental products and enhanced customer service. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of DeCare have been included in our consolidated results for periods following April 9, 2009. Suspension by The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services During 2008, we worked with The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to resolve issues identified as a result of our internal compliance audits and findings from a 2008 CMS audit. Our work included detailed action plans to remediate such findings. In addition, we engaged an independent third party to provide CMS with on-going assessments regarding our compliance, including verification of systems, processes and procedures. On January 12, 2009, CMS notified us that we were suspended from marketing to and enrolling new members in our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D health benefit products until remediation efforts had been fully implemented and confirmed. On September 9, 2009, CMS notified us that the sanctions had been lifted. We began marketing our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D products on October 1, 2009 and began enrolling new members on November 15, 2009 for the 2010 contract year. However, we are not currently eligible to receive auto-enrollment or reassignment of Medicare Part D Low Income Subsidy, or LIS, beneficiaries. We continue to work with CMS to demonstrate that our operations related to the Medicare Part D LIS programs have been corrected so that we will again be allowed to participate in the Medicare Part D LIS auto-assignment process. Stock Repurchase Program We regularly review the appropriate use of capital. Accordingly, under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. The repurchases are effected from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased and retired approximately 57.3 million shares at an average per share price of $46.02, for an aggregate cost of $2.6 billion. On March 5, 2009, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of $1.5 billion in our stock repurchase program. On October 23, 2009, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase of $0.5 billion in our stock repurchase program, subject to completion of the Express Scripts transaction, and pending current market and industry conditions. As of December 31, 2009, $0.4 49 Table of Contents billion remained authorized for future repurchases. On January 26, 2010, our Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by $3.5 billion. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we repurchased and retired approximately 6.5 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $0.4 billion, leaving approximately $3.5 billion for authorized future repurchases at February 10, 2010. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares when we believe it is a prudent use of capital. Tax Resolutions During the year ended December 31, 2008, we settled disputes with the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, relating to certain tax years and industry issues that we had been discussing with the IRS for several years. Also relating to the industry issues that were settled, we recorded additional tax benefits that had previously been denied by the IRS. In addition, tax litigation in the U.S. Tax Court concluded adversely to us during 2008. The case has been appealed to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals and oral arguments are scheduled for February 2010. IV. Membership—December 31, 2009 Compared to December 31, 2008 Our medical membership includes seven different customer types: Local Group, Individual, National Accounts, BlueCard, Senior, State-Sponsored and FEP. BCBSA-branded business refers to members in our service, or geographic, areas licensed by the BCBSA. Non-BCBSA-branded business refers to UniCare members predominately outside of our BCBSA service areas. • Local Group (including UniCare) consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 2,500 eligible employees. • Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 (including UniCare) and their covered dependents. • National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in a WellPoint service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 2,500 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker relationships. • BlueCard host members represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by WellPoint who receive health care services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-WellPoint controlled BCBSA licensee (i.e., the “home” plan). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard claims received per month. • Senior members are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a managed care alternative for the Medicare program, or who have purchased Medicare Supplement benefit coverage. • State-Sponsored membership represents eligible members with State-Sponsored managed care alternatives in Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Plan programs. • FEP members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who 50 Table of Contents elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some self-funded customers choose to purchase stop-loss coverage to limit their retained risk. The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Also included below are other businesses’ key metrics, including prescription volume for our PBM companies, which were sold to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009, and other membership by product. The medical membership and other businesses’ metrics presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

Managed dental membership includes members acquired through the DeCare acquisition for which we provide administrative services only. 2 NM = Not meaningful. 3 PBM business was sold to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009 resulting in eleven months of PBM volume reported for 2009. 4 Mail order scripts generally cover a 60 or 90 day supply with a weighted average supply of 86 days. The mail order script volume shown in the above table has been adjusted to reflect a 30 day supply. 51 Table of Contents Medical Membership During the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, total medical membership decreased 1,379,000, or 4%, primarily due to decreases in Local Group (including UniCare), State-Sponsored, Individual and Senior businesses, partially offset by increases in our National Accounts membership. The majority of the decline was in our Local Group business and primarily reflects lapses and net unfavorable in-group change caused by higher unemployment resulting from the current economic downturn partially offset by new sales. In-group enrollment change represents membership changes within a group that still remains our customer. Self-funded medical membership decreased 284,000, or 2%, primarily due to declines in self-funded Local Group membership resulting from lapses and net unfavorable in-group change caused by higher unemployment and withdrawal from the Connecticut Medicaid program, partially offset by an increase in self-funded National Account membership resulting from additional sales and ongoing conversions to self-funded arrangements. Fully-insured membership decreased by 1,095,000 members, or 7%, primarily due to declines in fully-insured Local Group membership resulting from lapses and net unfavorable in-group enrollment change caused by higher unemployment partially offset by new sales, reduced Individual membership, partially caused by the current economic downturn, lower membership in certain California State-Sponsored programs and ongoing conversions to self-funded arrangements. Local Group membership decreased 989,000, or 6%, primarily due to membership declines in our BCBSA-branded business, and to a lesser extent, our UniCare business. These declines were primarily related to lapses and net unfavorable in-group enrollment changes associated with the current economic downturn partially offset by new sales. Certain of our UniCare members began transitioning to HCSC on January 1, 2010. Individual membership decreased 141,000, or 6%, due to competitive pricing pressures and overall economic conditions. This decline was weighted slightly more toward our BCBSA-branded business, but was also driven by UniCare. Certain of our UniCare members began transitioning to HCSC on January 1, 2010. National Accounts membership increased 93,000, or 1%, primarily driven by additional sales, reflective of our extensive and cost-effective provider networks and a broad and innovative product portfolio. These increases were partially offset by lapses and net unfavorable in-group enrollment changes due to the current economic downturn. BlueCard membership increased 8,000, or less than 1%, primarily due to increased utilization by other BCBSA licensee members who reside in or travel to our licensed areas. Senior membership decreased 89,000, or 7%, primarily due to the loss of membership from product portfolio changes implemented in 2009 for certain Medicare Advantage plans, including withdrawal from selected plans and lower membership in Medicare Supplement. State-Sponsored membership decreased 259,000, or 13%, primarily due to our strategic withdrawal from the Connecticut and Nevada Medicaid programs and certain California State-Sponsored programs partially offset by growth in Indiana as a competitor exited the state. Other Membership Our Other products are often ancillary to our health business, and can therefore be impacted by corresponding changes in our medical membership. Behavioral health membership decreased 603,000, or 3%, primarily due to higher unemployment resulting from the current economic downturn, partially offset by growth in certain products. 52 Table of Contents Life and disability membership decreased 84,000, or 2%, primarily due to lapses and net unfavorable in-group enrollment changes associated with the current economic downturn and increasing unemployment. Life and disability products are generally offered as a part of Commercial medical fully-insured membership sales. Dental membership decreased 276,000, or 6%, primarily due to net unfavorable in-group enrollment changes and lapses due to the current economic downturn, partially offset by new sales to several groups and members acquired with DeCare on April 9, 2009. Managed dental membership increased 3,949,000 reflecting our acquisition of DeCare on April 9, 2009. Vision membership increased 474,000, or 18%, primarily due to continued sales and market penetration of our Blue View vision product, partially offset by lapses and net unfavorable in-group changes. Medicare Part D membership decreased 361,000, or 19%, as the CMS sanctions prevented us from capturing sales from new business to offset declines, including those from normal attrition. PBM Prescription Volume PBM prescription volume was completely transferred to Express Scripts as a result of the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009. For the eleven months ended November 30, 2009 as compared to November 30, 2008, prescription volume decreased 2,009,000, or 1%, primarily due to a decrease in retail scripts resulting from lower membership driven by the current economic conditions and the exit from a joint venture in the Northeast. The declines were partially offset by increases in script volume as our PBM business began servicing approximately one million members transferred from an outside vendor on January 1, 2009. V. Cost of Care The following discussion summarizes our aggregate underlying cost of care trends for the rolling 12 months ended December 31, 2009 for our Local Group fully-insured business only. As previously discussed, these costs are influenced by our mix of managed care products, including PPO, HMO, POS and CDHP products, in addition to changes in the unit costs and utilization levels. Our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing the year-over-year change in average per member per month claim costs, including member co-payments and deductibles. While our cost of care trend varies by geographic location, based on underlying medical cost trends our aggregate cost of care trend was 8.9%. Overall, our medical cost trend continued to be driven by unit costs. Inpatient hospital trend was in the low double digit range and was primarily related to increases in cost per admission. Developing trend indicates that approximately 90% of the inpatient trend is cost driven, while 10% is utilization driven. Primary contributors to unit cost trends include elevated average case acuity (intensity) as well as higher negotiated rate increases with hospitals. As we are successful in moving lower intensity procedures to lower cost outpatient services, the remaining inpatient procedures are of higher average intensity. A portion of the recent inpatient trend acceleration is attributable to utilization. Both the inpatient admission counts per thousand members and the inpatient day counts per thousand members were higher than the prior year. The average length of inpatient stays also increased over prior year levels. Continued clinical management and re-contracting efforts are in place to help mitigate the inpatient trend increases. Programs such as the enterprise-wide enhanced 360º Health care management programs, the industry’s first program to integrate all care management programs and tools into a centralized, consumer-friendly resource, continue to aid our members in accessing the most comprehensive and appropriate care available. Efforts also include focused review of neo-natal intensive care unit cases, spinal surgery cases and enhanced clinical management of chronic kidney disease/end-stage renal disease cases. New pilot programs are being introduced for readmission management as well as focused utilization management at high cost facilities. 53 Table of Contents Outpatient trend was in the low double digit range and was 65% cost driven and 35% utilization driven. Outpatient costs are a collection of different types of expenses, such as outpatient facilities, labs, x-rays, emergency room, and occupational and physical therapy. Per visit costs are still the largest contributor to overall outpatient trend, influenced by price increases within certain provider contracts. Utilization increases are spanning multiple categories of outpatient care and are driving some of the increased trend in recent months. ER management programs and initiatives to help optimize site of service decisions are serving to encourage appropriate utilization of outpatient services. Additionally, we continued to see the positive impact of incorporating the technology of our American Imaging Management, Inc., or AIM, subsidiary. This is allowing us to achieve greater efficiencies in the high trend area of radiology, ensuring that consumers receive the quality tests they need. Expanding AIM’s platform to nuclear cardiology management and specialty pharmacy reviews is aiding our efforts to mitigate trend increases. Physician services trend was in the mid single digit range and was 55% cost driven and 45% utilization driven. Increases in the physician care category were partially driven by contracting changes. Recent increases in utilization trends are driven at least in part by recent H1N1 activity. We are continually monitoring H1N1 and seasonal flu experience (both internal and national experience) to ensure that trend estimates reflect the best information available. Additionally, we continue to collaborate with physicians to improve quality of care through pay-for-performance programs. Pharmacy trend was in the mid-to-high single digit range and was primarily unit cost (cost per prescription) related. Recent inflation in the average wholesale price of drugs is applying upward pressure to the overall cost per prescription as is the increased use of specialty drugs. Specialty drugs, also known as biotech drugs, are generally higher cost and are being utilized more frequently. The increase in cost per prescription measures were mitigated by increases in our generic usage rates, benefit plan design changes and continued management of contracting arrangements and fee schedules. In response to cost trends, we continue to pursue contracting and plan design changes, promote and implement performance-based contracts that reward clinical outcomes and quality, and expand our radiology management, disease management and advanced care management programs. Expansion continues on 360º Health, which assists patients in navigating the health care system, using their health benefits and accessing the most comprehensive and appropriate care available. Additionally, our Resolution Health, Inc. subsidiary is allowing us to fully integrate their suite of products to extend the range and quality of services for our members. As a leading data analytics-driven personal health care guidance company, Resolution Health, Inc. continues to expand its efforts to improve healthcare quality and reduce healthcare costs. The sale of our PBM business and the resulting strategic alliance with Express Scripts will bring with it greater capabilities and resources, allowing members to leverage more cost-effective solutions and state-of-the-art PBM services. In addition to these efforts, we continuously evaluate our drug formulary to ensure the most effective pharmaceutical therapies are available for our members. 54 Table of Contents VI. Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are discussed in the following section.

These decreases were partially offset by premium rate increases for all medical lines of business and increased reimbursement in the FEP program. Administrative fees remained level at $3.8 billion in 2009, primarily due to increased pricing in our Local Group self-funded business, self-funded membership growth in National Accounts, revenue from DeCare following the acquisition and increased State-Sponsored fees, partially offset by lower revenues in our NGS Medicare business and our withdrawal from the Connecticut Medicaid program. Other revenue is comprised principally of co-payments and deductibles associated with the sale of mail-order prescription drugs by our PBM companies, which provide services to members of our Commercial and Consumer segments and third party clients. Other revenue decreased $35.3 million, or 6%, to $606.3 million in 2009, primarily due to one less month of PBM revenue as compared to 2008, resulting from the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009 and decreased mail order script volume from third parties prior to the sale, partially offset by proceeds from the UniCare member transition agreement with HCSC and DeCare revenues following the acquisition of DeCare on April 9, 2009. Net investment income decreased $50.1 million, or 6%, to $801.0 million in 2009, primarily resulting from reduced investment balances, prior to the receipt of the PBM sale proceeds, and lower yields on short-term investments. Gain on sale of business of $3.8 billion represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts. We received $4.7 billion in cash. A summary of our net realized gains (losses) on investments for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 $ Change 2009 2008 (In millions) Net realized gains on investments Net realized gains (losses) from the sale of fixed maturity securities $ 22.8 $ (46.9 ) $ 69.7 Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities 35.0 28.3 6.7 Other net realized (losses) gains on investments (1.4 ) 47.3 (48.7 ) Net realized gains on investments 56.4 28.7 27.7 Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income Other-than-temporary impairment losses—equity securities (232.6 ) (728.1 ) 495.5 Other-than-temporary impairment losses—fixed maturity securities (217.6 ) (479.8 ) 262.2 Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income (450.2 ) (1,207.9 ) 757.7 Net realized gains on investments and other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income $ (393.8 ) $ (1,179.2 ) $ 785.4 Net realized gains on investments increased in 2009 primarily due to increased gains from the sale of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by declines in realized gains on other investments. 56 Table of Contents Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income in 2009 were equally related to impairment of fixed maturity securities, primarily from declines in credit ratings and declines in equity securities. There was no individually significant other-than-temporary impairment of investments by issuer during the year ended December 31, 2009. Net realized gains/losses on investments and other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income for the year ended December 31, 2008 were primarily driven by other-than-temporary impairments related to the deterioration in equity markets, and to a lesser extent, other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities. The other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income included $135.0 million, $106.6 million, and $90.2 million, respectively, for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., or Lehman (or their respective subsidiaries, as appropriate) that were recorded in 2008. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” within this MD&A for a discussion of our investment impairment review process. Benefit expense decreased $1.2 billion, or 2%, to $46.6 billion in 2009, primarily due to fully-insured membership declines across our Commercial and Consumer businesses, including results from our strategic actions taken with State-Sponsored programs that led to the withdrawal from certain programs. In addition, we experienced higher than anticipated prior year favorable reserve releases of an estimated $262.0 million during 2009 that were not reestablished at December 31, 2009. Finally, lower benefit expense in our Senior business contributed to the overall decrease in benefit expense. The lower benefit expense in the Senior business included reduced benefit expense for Medicare Advantage, which primarily reflected product portfolio changes and pricing adjustments that were implemented in 2009. These decreases were partially offset by increases in benefit costs in our Local Group and FEP businesses. The increase in Local Group benefit costs were driven by higher unit costs and the impact of the recession on business mix changes, including higher COBRA membership and increased utilization. We are refining our product offerings, expanding membership retention programs, driving cost of care initiatives and implementing pricing actions to favorably impact our Local Group business. Our benefit expense ratio decreased 100 basis points to 82.6% in 2009, due to improvements in our Consumer segment, partially offset by increases in our Commercial segment. Both our Consumer and Commercial segments benefited from higher than anticipated prior year favorable reserve releases of an estimated $262.0 million during 2009 that were not reestablished at December 31, 2009, which favorably impacted the benefit expense ratio by 46 basis points. The decline in the Consumer segment benefit expense ratio was also driven by improvements in our Senior business, primarily due to product portfolio changes and pricing adjustments in Medicare Advantage that were implemented for 2009, and improved results in State-Sponsored business due to certain strategic actions that have been undertaken. These decreases in the benefit expense ratio were partially offset by a higher ratio for Local Group business, reflecting higher unit costs and the impact of the recession on business mix changes, including higher COBRA membership and increased utilization. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $638.6 million, or 7%, to $9.7 billion in 2009. Our selling, general and administrative expense increased due to higher incentive compensation costs and outside services. In addition, as further described in Note 19 to the audited financial statements included in this Form 10-K, we recorded $171.6 million of restructuring costs during the fourth quarter of 2009. These expenses were partially offset by lower selling expenses. These drivers, as well as lower operating revenue resulting from declining membership, caused our selling, general and administrative expense ratio to increase 130 basis points to 15.9% in 2009. Cost of drugs sold decreased $49.5 million, or 11%, to $419.0 million in 2009, primarily due to one less month of PBM activity as compared to 2008, resulting from the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009 and decreased mail order prescription volume from third parties prior to the sale. Interest expense decreased $22.4 million, or 5%, to $447.4 million in 2009, primarily due to a reduced use of commercial paper and the repurchase of our zero coupon notes, partially offset by slightly higher interest rates on new debt, including the issuance of $1.0 billion of long-term debt in February 2009. 57 Table of Contents Amortization of other intangible assets decreased $20.1 million, or 7%, to $266.0 million in 2009, primarily due to reductions in amortization of certain other intangible assets acquired in prior years and ceasing amortization related to PBM intangible assets due to the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009. Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets increased $121.1 million, or 86%, to $262.5 million in 2009. As further discussed in Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, the anticipated closing of the PBM sale, the expected decline in 2010 Medicare Part D auto-assigned membership and the anticipated transition of our Illinois and Texas UniCare commercial group and individual members to HCSC, triggered an interim impairment review of our UniCare tradenames as of September 30, 2009. As a result, we identified and recorded a pre-tax impairment charge relating to our UniCare tradenames during the third quarter of 2009, the majority of which was driven by the loss of the 2010 low margin Medicare Part D auto-assigned membership. Subsequently, primarily in connection with the December 2009 closing of the PBM sale and the execution of the HCSC agreement, we initiated an impairment review of goodwill associated with our UniCare subsidiaries during the fourth quarter and also updated a previous impairment review of our UniCare tradename. These reviews resulted in an impairment charge of $57.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 to adjust the carrying values of the goodwill and intangible assets to their estimated fair values. As a result, total impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets were $262.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. During 2008, due to ongoing changes in the economic and regulatory environment in our State-Sponsored business, including California budgetary cuts, we revised our outlook for this business in certain states. This revision triggered an interim impairment review of our indefinite lived intangible assets related to State-Sponsored licenses in certain states, and we identified and recorded a pre-tax impairment charge relating to certain intangible assets of $141.4 million during 2008. Income tax expense increased $2.0 billion to $2.7 billion in 2009. During 2009 income tax expense was higher as we recorded income tax expense of $1.4 billion related to the sale of our PBM business and as a result of increased income before income tax expense. During 2008, income tax expense was lower due to a combination of settlement of disputes with the IRS relating to certain prior tax years, lower state income taxes due to changes in the composition of the apportionment factors in our combined state income tax returns, settlements of disputes on state audits and lower income before income tax expense. The effective tax rates in 2009 and 2008 were 35.9% and 20.2%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2008 was primarily due to the settlement of the outstanding IRS disputes. Our net income as a percentage of total revenue increased 320 basis points, from 4.1% in 2008 to 7.3% in 2009, primarily due to the gain on the sale of our PBM business. Excluding the gain on sale, our net income as a percentage of total revenue was 3.9% in 2009. Reportable Segments We use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, which are Commercial, Consumer and Other. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, selling, general and administrative expense and cost of drugs. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains/losses on investments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. For additional information, see Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 included in this Form 10-K. The discussions of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 58 Table of Contents Commercial Our Commercial segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 $ Change % Change 2009 2008 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 37,363.4 $ 38,009.3 $ (645.9 ) (2 )% Operating gain $ 2,430.3 $ 3,392.7 $ (962.4 ) (28 )% Operating margin 6.5 % 8.9 % (240 )bp Operating revenue decreased $645.9 million, or 2%, to $37.4 billion in 2009, primarily due to fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group, UniCare and National businesses due to economic factors. These decreases were partially offset by premium rate increases for all medical lines of business, increased membership in our self-funded National business, increased fees in our Local Group self-funded business and revenues from DeCare following our acquisition of DeCare in April, 2009. Operating gain decreased $962.4 million, or 28%, to $2.4 billion in 2009 primarily due to higher benefit expenses in our Local Group business, overall increased administrative costs and fully-insured membership declines resulting from the current economic conditions. The higher benefit expenses in our Local Group business were driven by higher unit costs and business mix changes, including higher COBRA membership and increased utilization. Administrative costs primarily increased due to a fourth quarter restructuring charge of $127.0 million and higher overall compensation costs. These operating gain declines were partially offset by premium rate increases and the impact of an estimated $81.0 million in higher than anticipated favorable prior year reserve releases that were not reestablished at December 31, 2009. The operating margin in 2009 was 6.5%, a 240 basis point decrease from 2008 primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Consumer Our Consumer segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 $ Change % Change 2009 2008 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 16,141.8 $ 16,437.3 $ (295.5 ) (2 )% Operating gain $ 1,279.7 $ 585.1 $ 694.6 119 % Operating margin 7.9 % 3.6 % 430 bp Operating revenue decreased $295.5 million, or 2%, to $16.1 billion in 2009, primarily due to our withdrawal from certain State-Sponsored programs, most notably the Ohio Medicaid programs, membership declines in Senior business and declines in our fully-insured Individual membership, partially offset by premium rate increases in all lines of business. Operating gain increased $694.6 million, or 119%, to $1.3 billion in 2009, primarily due to higher than anticipated prior year favorable reserve releases of an estimated $181.0 million in 2009 that were not reestablished at December 31, 2009, as well as improved results in our Senior business as we implemented benefit design changes and modified pricing for 2009. We also had improved results in our State-Sponsored business due to strategic actions taken, including withdrawal from certain unprofitable contracts as well as working with individual states on certain benefit design changes. 59 Table of Contents The operating margin in 2009 was 7.9%, a 430 basis point increase over 2008 primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Other Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 $ Change % Change 2009 2008 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 7,323.4 $ 7,132.6 $ 190.8 3 % Operating gain $ 469.4 $ 370.0 $ 99.4 27 % Operating revenue increased $190.8 million, or 3%, to $7.3 billion in 2009, primarily due to higher premiums in our FEP business, partially offset by lower administrative fees in our NGS business and one less month of PBM revenue in 2009 as compared to 2008, resulting from the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts. Operating gain increased $99.4 million, or 27%, to $469.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase was due to improved results for the first eleven months of 2009 in our PBM business, primarily with respect to our retail and specialty pharmacy operations, and as NextRx began servicing approximately one million customers transferred from an outside vendor on January 1, 2009. Our PBM business was sold to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009; results of the PBM business are included in our results until the sale date. In addition, operating gain in our disease management and cost of care businesses increased. These increases were partially offset by higher unallocated incentive compensation expense. As a consequence of the PBM sale, the future operating results of the Other segment will no longer benefit from the operating revenue and operating gain associated with the PBM business. 60 Table of Contents VII. Membership—December 31, 2008 Compared to December 31, 2007 The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. Also included below are other businesses’ key metrics, including prescription volume for our PBM companies and other membership by product. The medical membership and other businesses’ metrics presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

The mail order script volume shown in the above table has been adjusted to reflect a 30 day supply. 61 Table of Contents Medical Membership During the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, total medical membership increased approximately 240,000, or 1%, due to increases in our National, Senior and FEP businesses, partially offset by declines in State-Sponsored, Individual and Local Group membership. Self-funded medical membership increased 783,000, or 4%, primarily due to an increase in self-funded National Accounts membership resulting from additional sales, BlueCard growth and Local Group growth and ongoing conversions to self-funded arrangements. Fully-insured membership decreased 543,000, or 3%, primarily due to declines in fully-insured Local Group membership, our exit from the Ohio Medicaid program and ongoing conversions to self-funded arrangements. Local Group membership decreased 31,000, or less than 1%, primarily due to the loss of 224,000 members in our UniCare business, partially offset by overall increases of 193,000 members in our BCBSA-branded business. Individual membership decreased 118,000, or 5%, with our UniCare business declining slightly more than BCBSA-branded business. The decline was due to competitive pricing pressures, competitive broker compensation in certain regions and overall economic conditions. National Accounts membership increased 331,000, or 5%, primarily driven by additional sales as employers are increasingly attracted to the benefits of our distinctive value proposition, which includes extensive and cost-effective provider networks and a broad and innovative product portfolio. These increases were partially offset by lapses and negative in-group-change due to the recent economic downturn. BlueCard membership increased 173,000, or 4%, primarily due to increased sales by other BCBSA licensees to accounts with members who reside in or travel to our licensed area. Senior membership increased 54,000, or 4%, primarily due to additional sales of our Medicare Advantage product, partially offset by a slight decline in Medicare Supplement membership. State-Sponsored membership decreased 182,000, or 8%, primarily due to our exit from the Ohio Medicaid programs. Other Membership Our Other products are often ancillary to our health business and can therefore be impacted by changes in our medical membership. Behavioral health membership increased 3,338,000, or 17%, primarily due to the conversion of 2,415,000 members from a third-party vendor in January 2008 and growth in membership due to new sales of our behavioral health products. Life and disability membership decreased 121,000, or 2%, primarily due to overall membership declines from a very competitive marketplace, reduction of members following employment declines at certain large customers and lapses due to the current economic environment. Life and disability membership is generally offered as part of Commercial medical fully-insured membership activity. Dental membership decreased 454,000, or 9%, primarily due to the loss of several large customers and sales continue to lag due to a slowing economy. Vision membership increased 213,000, or 9%, primarily due to continued market penetration of our Blue View Vision product. Medicare Part D membership increased 256,000, or 16%, primarily due to growth from new sales during the 2008 marketing period. 62 Table of Contents PBM Prescription Volume Prescription volume for paid scripts in our PBM companies increased by 16,426,000, or 7%. Paid script increases were primarily due to an increase in retail scripts resulting from higher membership, partially offset by lower utilization of our mail order business. The lower utilization of our mail order business resulted primarily from the introduction of four dollar generic drug programs offered by certain large retailers and the introduction of Zyrtec® as an over-the-counter drug. Our PBM business was sold to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009. VIII. Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are discussed in the following section. Year EndedDecember 31 $ Change % Change 2008 2007 (In millions, except per share data) Premiums $ 57,101.0 $ 55,865.0 $ 1,236.0 2 % Administrative fees 3,836.6 3,673.6 163.0 4 Other revenue 641.6 617.0 24.6 4 Total operating revenue 61,579.2 60,155.6 1,423.6 2 Net investment income 851.1 1,001.1 (150.0 ) (15 ) Net realized gains on investments 28.7 270.9 (242.2 ) NM 1 Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments: Total other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments (1,207.9 ) (259.7 ) (948.2 ) NM 1 Portion of other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in other comprehensive income — — — NM 1 Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income (1,207.9 ) (259.7 ) (948.2 ) NM 1 Total revenues 61,251.1 61,167.9 83.2 — Benefit expense 47,742.4 46,037.2 1,705.2 4 Selling, general and administrative expense: Selling expense 1,778.4 1,716.8 61.6 4 General and administrative expense 7,242.1 6,984.7 257.4 4 Total selling, general and administrative expense 9,020.5 8,701.5 319.0 4 Cost of drugs 468.5 432.7 35.8 8 Interest expense 469.8 447.9 21.9 5 Amortization of other intangible assets 286.1 290.7 (4.6 ) (2 ) Impairment of intangible assets 141.4 — 141.4 NM 1 Total expenses 58,128.7 55,910.0 2,218.7 4 Income before income tax expense 3,122.4 5,257.9 (2,135.5 ) (41 ) Income tax expense 631.7 1,912.5 (1,280.8 ) (67 ) Net income $ 2,490.7 $ 3,345.4 $ (854.7 ) (26 ) Average diluted shares outstanding 523.0 602.0 (79.0 ) (13 ) Diluted net income per share $ 4.76 $ 5.56 $ (0.80 ) (14 ) Benefit expense ratio2 83.6 % 82.4 % 120 bp3 Selling, general and administrative expense ratio4 14.6 % 14.5 % 10 bp3 Income before income taxes as a percentage of total revenue 5.1 % 8.6 % (350 )bp3 Net income as a percentage of total revenue 4.1 % 5.5 % (140 )bp3 Certain of the following definitions are also applicable to all other results of operations tables in this discussion: 1 NM = Not meaningful 2 Benefit expense ratio = Benefit expense ÷ Premiums. 3 bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%. 4 Selling, general and administrative expense ratio = Total selling, general and administrative expense ÷ Total operating revenue. 63 Table of Contents Premiums increased $1.2 billion, or 2%, to $57.1 billion in 2008, primarily due to premium rate increases for all medical customer types, growth in our Medicare Advantage business and increased reimbursement in the FEP program. These increases were partially offset by the loss of the New York State prescription drug contract, our exit from the Ohio Medicaid program, fully-insured membership declines in UniCare and National Accounts, the conversion of the Connecticut Medicaid program from fully-insured to self-funded in December 2007 and fully-insured membership declines in Local Group business. Administrative fees increased $163.0 million, or 4%, to $3.8 billion in 2008, primarily due to self-funded membership growth in National and Local Group and increased revenue for medical management programs offered by CHS. Self-funded membership growth was driven by successful efforts to attract large self-funded accounts and was attributable to our network breadth, discounts, service and increased focus on health improvement and wellness. Self-funded membership growth also increased due to the conversion of the Connecticut Medicaid program from fully-insured to self-funded in December 2007. These increases were partially offset by lower fees in our Blue Card business. Other revenue is comprised principally of co-payments and deductibles associated with the sale of mail-order prescription drugs by our PBM companies, which provide services to members of our Commercial and Consumer segments and third party clients. Other revenue increased $24.6 million, or 4%, to $641.6 million in 2008, primarily due to increased specialty prescription volume, partially offset by decreased mail order script volume. The lower utilization in our mail order business, as previously described, resulted primarily from the introduction of four dollar generic drug programs offered by certain large retailers and the introduction of Zyrtec® as an over-the-counter-drug. Net investment income decreased $150.0 million, or 15%, to $851.1 million in 2008 primarily resulting from reduced investment balances and lower yields on short-term investments during 2008. A summary of our net realized (losses) gains on investments for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 is as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 $ Change 2008 2007 (In millions) Net realized gains on investments Net realized (losses) gains from the sale of fixed maturity securities $ (46.9 ) $ 11.5 $ (58.4 ) Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities 28.3 254.2 (225.9 ) Other net realized gains on investments 47.3 5.2 42.1 Net realized gains on investments 28.7 270.9 (242.2 ) Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income Other-than-temporary impairment losses—equity securities (728.1 ) (105.6 ) (622.5 ) Other-than-temporary impairment losses—fixed maturity securities (479.8 ) (154.1 ) (325.7 ) Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income (1,207.9 ) (259.7 ) (948.2 ) Net realized (losses) gains on investments and other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income $ (1,179.2 ) $ 11.2 $ (1,190.4 ) 64 Table of Contents Net realized losses in 2008 were primarily driven by other-than-temporary impairments related to the deterioration in equity markets and, to a lesser extent, other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities. Significant other-than-temporary impairments recognized for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $135.0 million, $106.6 million, and $90.2 million, respectively, for Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Lehman (or their respective subsidiaries, as appropriate). Recent market concerns related to those entities’ financial condition and liquidity prompted the U.S. government to seize control of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and resulted in Lehman filing for bankruptcy protection. In addition, other-than-temporary impairments recognized for the year ended December 31, 2008 included charges for fixed maturity securities and equity securities for which, due to credit downgrades and/or the extent and duration of their decline in fair value in light of the current market conditions, we determined that the impairment was deemed other-than-temporary. These securities covered a number of industries, primarily led by the banking and financial services sectors. Net realized gains in 2007 were primarily driven by sales of equity securities at a gain, partially offset by interest rate related impairments of fixed maturity securities and other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” within this MD&A for a discussion of our investment impairment review process. Benefit expense increased $1.7 billion, or 4%, to $47.7 billion in 2008, primarily due to overall higher medical costs in our Local Group fully-insured and Medicare Advantage businesses. The higher benefit expense in Local Group resulted from higher medical costs and less favorable prior period development, as well as membership changes, including lower fully-insured membership. Higher medical costs in Medicare Advantage resulted from both membership growth and increases in medical costs due to higher utilization resulting from adverse selection in certain of these products, which were caused by benefit design. We have addressed this matter for 2009 through pricing and benefit design changes. These increases were partially offset by the loss of the New York State prescription drug contract, the conversion of the State-Sponsored Connecticut Medicaid program from fully-insured to self-funded in December 2007, fully-insured membership declines in UniCare, our exit from the Ohio Medicaid program and fully-insured membership declines in National Accounts and Local Group businesses. Our benefit expense ratio increased 120 basis points to 83.6% in 2008, primarily due to higher medical costs in our Local Group fully-insured business, as well as higher medical costs in our Consumer segment. The benefit expense ratio in Local Group fully-insured business increased due to higher medical costs in certain geographies. The medical costs in our Consumer segment were primarily driven by Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D. As previously discussed, we are addressing these Medicare Advantage costs in 2009 by changing the benefit design. The increase in the benefit expense ratio related to our Medicare Part D business was driven by membership increases in 2008 as this business carries a higher benefit expense ratio than our overall company average. These overall increases in our benefit expense ratio were partially offset by the loss of the New York State prescription drug contract which had a higher than average benefit expense ratio. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $319.0 million, or 4%, to $9.0 billion in 2008, primarily due to higher salary and related benefits as a result of merit increases to employees, outside services, selling expense and severance, offset by lower incentive compensation costs. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio increased 10 basis points to 14.6% in 2008. The increase in our selling, general and administrative expense ratio was primarily due to the higher costs mentioned above offset by growth in operating revenue, which allows for leveraging of general and administrative costs over a larger revenue base, and lower incentive compensation costs. Cost of drugs sold increased $35.8 million, or 8%, to $468.5 million in 2008, primarily due to increased prescription volume in our specialty pharmacy companies. These specialty prescription drugs generally carry a higher cost than other prescription drugs. These increased costs were partially offset by decreased mail order script volume. Interest expense increased $21.9 million, or 5%, to $469.8 million in 2008, primarily due to the issuance of $2.0 billion of long-term debt during 2007, partially offset by lower rates paid on our commercial paper and other variable rate debt. 65 Table of Contents Amortization of other intangible assets decreased $4.6 million, or 2%, to $286.1 million in 2008, primarily due to reductions in amortization of certain intangibles acquired in prior years, partially offset by amortization of intangibles acquired with the AIM acquisition during 2007. During the third quarter of 2008, due to ongoing changes in the economic and regulatory environment in our State-Sponsored business, including California budgetary cuts, we revised our outlook for this business in certain states. This revision triggered an interim impairment review of our indefinite lived intangible assets related to State-Sponsored licenses in certain states, and we identified and recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $141.4 million during the third quarter of 2008. Income tax expense decreased $1.3 billion, or 67%, to $631.7 million in 2008, resulting from a combination of settlement of disputes with the IRS relating to certain prior tax years, lower state income taxes due to changes in the composition of the apportionment factors in our combined state income tax returns, settlements of disputes on state audits and lower income before income tax expense. The reduction in income before income tax expense included amounts recorded for other-than-temporary investment impairments and the impairment of certain intangible assets. The effective tax rates in 2008 and 2007 were 20.2% and 36.4%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2008 was primarily due to the settlement of outstanding IRS disputes. Our net income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 140 basis points, from 5.5% in 2007 to 4.1% in 2008. The decrease in this metric reflected a combination of all factors discussed above. Reportable Segments We use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, which are Commercial, Consumer and Other. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, selling, general and administrative expense and cost of drugs. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains (losses) on investments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, impairment of intangible assets or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. For additional information, see Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. The discussions of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our reportable segments’ results of operations for 2007 have been reclassified to conform to the 2009 and 2008 presentation. Commercial Our Commercial segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 $ Change % Change 2008 2007 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 38,009.3 $ 38,133.7 $ (124.4 ) 0% Operating gain $ 3,392.7 $ 3,855.9 $ (463.2 ) (12)% Operating margin 8.9 % 10.1 % (120)bp Operating revenue decreased $124.4 million, or less than 1%, to $38.0 billion in 2008, primarily due to the loss of the New York State prescription drug contract and fully-insured membership declines in Local Group, including UniCare, and National Accounts businesses, almost fully offset by premium rate increases in all medical lines of business. 66 Table of Contents Operating gain decreased $463.2 million, or 12%, to $3.4 billion in 2008 due to higher benefit expense resulting from higher medical costs and less favorable prior period development, as well as membership changes in Local Group, including lower fully-insured membership. In addition, the decrease in operating gain reflects increased selling, general and administrative expense for compensation, selling and severance costs. The operating margin in 2008 was 8.9%, a 120 basis point decrease primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Consumer Our Consumer segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 $ Change % Change 2008 2007 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 16,437.3 $ 15,285.7 $ 1,151.6 8% Operating gain $ 585.1 $ 789.1 $ (204.0 ) (26)% Operating margin 3.6 % 5.2 % (160)bp Operating revenue increased $1.2 billion, or 8%, to $16.4 billion in 2008, primarily due to growth in our Senior business, particularly in Medicare Advantage. These increases were partially offset by declines in operating revenue due to our exit from the Ohio Medicaid program and the conversion of the State-Sponsored Connecticut Medicaid business from fully-insured to self-funded in December 2007. Operating gain decreased $204.0 million, or 26%, to $585.1 million in 2008, primarily due to higher benefit expense within Medicare Advantage and lower margins in Medicare Part D business, primarily attributable to a higher percentage of dual eligible membership in 2008 than 2007. Higher benefit expense in Medicare Advantage was primarily due to higher utilization resulting from the benefit design of certain of these products which resulted in adverse selection. We have addressed this matter for 2009 through pricing and benefit design changes. The operating margin in 2008 was 3.6%, a 160 basis point decrease primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Other Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 $ Change % Change 2008 2007 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 7,132.6 $ 6,736.2 $ 396.4 6 % Operating gain $ 370.0 $ 339.2 $ 30.8 9 % Operating revenue increased $396.4 million, or 6%, to $7.1 billion in 2008, primarily due to higher premiums in FEP business, as well as revenues generated by AIM, which was acquired in the third quarter of 2007. Operating gain increased $30.8 million, or 9%, to $370.0 million in 2008. This increase was due to improved results in our PBM and behavioral health businesses. PBM results improved due to higher retail sales and rebate retention which aligned with market rates. Results for our behavioral health business improved due to higher membership and improved administration rates. 67 Table of Contents IX. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider some of our most important accounting policies that require estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, included in this Form 10-K. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. Medical Claims Payable The most judgmental accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2009, this liability was $5.5 billion and represented 20% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 99.7%, or $5.5 billion, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2009; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 0.3%, or $16.9 million, of the total medical claims payable as of December 31, 2009. The level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period end to the next, from 0% to 3% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made. Liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or “trend factors”. Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of 68 Table of Contents business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison of prior year, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense. In addition to incurred but not paid claims, the liability for medical claims payable includes reserves for premium deficiencies, if appropriate. Premium deficiencies are recognized when it is probable that expected claims and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums on existing medical insurance contracts without consideration of investment income. Determination of premium deficiencies for longer duration life and disability contracts includes consideration of investment income. For purposes of premium deficiencies, contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. No premium deficiencies were established at year end 2009. We regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each quarter and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that quarter. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable. In 2009, higher than anticipated favorable reserve releases of approximately $262.0 million were recognized and not reestablished at December 31, 2009. The majority of that release is due to recognition of considerable improvements in our processing environment and continued better transparency into claims payments. While there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid liability as of December 31, 2009 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by other operational variables including system changes, provider submission patterns and business combinations. There is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through 12 months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. In our analysis for the claim liabilities at December 31, 2009, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 80 and 120 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower variability ranging from 20 to 60 basis points. Over the period from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009, completion factors have increased as the impacts of faster processing have been fully reflected in the historical patterns. With consideration of claim payments during 2009, the completion factors used to determine the incurred but not paid claim liability estimate for the December 31, 2008 valuation period have developed slightly higher than those used at December 31, 2008. The increase in completion factors has been taken into consideration when determining the completion factors used in establishing the December 31, 2009 incurred but not paid claim liability by choosing factors that reflect the more recent experience. The difference in completion factor assumptions, assuming moderately adverse experience, results in variability of 5%, or approximately $279.0 million, in the December 31, 2009 69 Table of Contents incurred but not paid claim liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein. The other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2009 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. In our analysis for the period ended December 31, 2009, there was a 610 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors assuming moderately adverse experience. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 9%, or approximately $478.0 million, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factor used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claim liability at December 31, 2009. As summarized below, Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides historical information regarding the accrual and payment of our medical claims liability. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements, the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year”. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. We believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for unpaid claims liability at each reporting date. 70 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 is as follows: Years Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Gross medical claims payable, beginning of period $ 6,184.7 $ 5,788.0 $ 5,290.3 Ceded medical claims payable, beginning of period (60.3 ) (60.7 ) (51.0 ) Net medical claims payable, beginning of period 6,124.4 5,727.3 5,239.3 Business combinations and purchase adjustments 2.8 — 15.2 Net incurred medical claims: Current year 47,315.1 47,940.9 46,366.2 Prior years redundancies (807.2 ) (263.2 ) (332.7 ) Total net incurred medical claims 46,507.9 47,677.7 46,033.5 Net payments attributable to: Current year medical claims 42,056.9 42,020.7 40,765.7 Prior years medical claims 5,157.6 5,259.9 4,795.0 Total net payments 47,214.5 47,280.6 45,560.7 Net medical claims payable, end of period 5,420.6 6,124.4 5,727.3 Ceded medical claims payable, end of period 29.9 60.3 60.7 Gross medical claims payable, end of period $ 5,450.5 $ 6,184.7 $ 5,788.0 Current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net incurred medical claims 88.9 % 87.7 % 87.9 % Prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net medical claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current period 15.2 % 4.8 % 6.8 % Prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims 1.7 % 0.6 % 0.8 % Amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled. Liabilities at any period end are continually reviewed and re-estimated as information regarding actual claims payments, or runout, becomes known. This information is compared to the originally established year end liability. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated. The prior year redundancy of $807.2 million shown above for the year ended December 31, 2009 represents an estimate based on paid claim activity from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009. Medical claim liabilities are usually described as having a “short tail”, which means that they are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the majority of the $807.2 million redundancy relates to claims incurred in calendar year 2008. 71 Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of the completion and trend factor assumptions, which had the most significant impact on the actual development of our incurred but not paid claims liability estimates for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by other operational variables, including system changes, provider submission patterns and business combinations. Favorable (Unfavorable) Developments byChanges in Key Assumptions 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Assumed trend factors $ 466.1 $ 383.5 $ 350.3 Assumed completion factors 341.1 (120.3 ) (17.6 ) Total $ 807.2 $ 263.2 $ 332.7 The favorable development in 2009 resulted from completion factors developing more favorably than those used at December 31, 2008 due to recognition of faster claims processing, and trend factors for the most recent two months developing lower than initially anticipated. The key factors driving the favorable developments in these key assumptions are below: • The receipt cycle time (date of service to date of receipt) declined by 5% and the payment cycle time (date of receipt to date of payment) declined by 11%, for an overall decline in claims payment cycle times of 7% in 2009; and • More favorable claims recovery activity than anticipated. The prior year redundancy in 2008 and 2007 was primarily driven by the favorable development of the trend factor assumption used for establishing the December 31, 2007 and 2006 medical claims payable, respectively, partially offset by a deficiency in the development of the completion factor assumption. The ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 88.9% for 2009, 87.7% for 2008, and 87.9% for 2007. Comparison of these ratios reflects the acceleration in processing that has occurred. We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current period in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. This metric was 15.2% for 2009, 4.8% for 2008, and 6.8% for 2007. The 1,040 basis point increase in 2009 from 2008 resulted from actual completion factors and claims trends differing from the assumptions used, with the increase in 2009 resulting from the factors noted above. The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in the above table for each of 2008 and 2007 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims—current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims—prior years redundancies” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 2008 2007 (In millions) Total net incurred medical claims, as reported $ 47,677.7 $ 46,033.5 Retrospective basis, as described above 47,133.7 46,103.0 Variance $ 544.0 $ (69.5 ) Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported 1.1 % (0.2 )% 72 Table of Contents Given that our business is primarily short tailed, the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2009 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2010. The 2008 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of 1.1% is higher than 2007 due to unfavorable developments impacting the 2007 reported incurred medical claims and the acceleration of claims processing that occurred during 2008 and 2009. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with FASB guidance, which requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance. At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following: • the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset; • the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim; • the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and • any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences. We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits, as required by the guidance. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted. In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intend to defend our positions vigorously through the federal, state and local appeals processes. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact on our results of operations from these matters. As of December 31, 2009, the examinations of our 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004 tax years are being concluded by the IRS. In addition, we have several tax years for which there are ongoing disputes related to pre-acquisition companies that are being concluded by the IRS. We joined the IRS Compliance Assurance Process, or CAP, in 2007 and continue to remain a participant. The objective of CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the IRS of the accuracy of tax returns prior to filing, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations. Administrative tax appeals and proceedings also continue for certain subsidiaries for tax years prior to being included in our consolidated tax return. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we completed the sale of our PBM business and recorded tax expense of $1.4 billion related to this sale. 73 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2008, we settled disputes with the IRS relating to certain tax years and involving industry issues which we had been discussing with the IRS for several years. For certain years, tax positions have been resolved but the overall tax year may require additional approval from the Joint Committee on Taxation before it can be finalized in total. In addition, tax litigation in the U.S. Tax Court concluded adversely to us during 2008. The case has been appealed to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals and oral arguments are scheduled for February 2010. While it is difficult to determine when a tax settlement will actually occur, it is reasonably possible that one could occur in the next twelve months and our unrecognized tax benefits could change within a range of approximately $0.0 million to $(50.0) million. For additional information, see Note 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, included in this Form 10-K. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2009 was $13.3 billion and other intangible assets were $8.3 billion. The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets represented 41% of our total consolidated assets and 87% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2009. We follow FASB guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, which include goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately. We completed our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarters of 2009, 2008 and 2007. These tests involved the use of estimates related to the fair value of the goodwill reporting unit and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and required a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Certain interim impairment tests were performed in 2009 and 2008 due to changes in our business. As a result of our annual and interim impairment tests during 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets of $262.5 million, $141.4 million and $0.0 million, respectively. Fair value is estimated using the income and market approaches for our goodwill reporting units and the income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. The income and market approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. The income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. These estimated future cash flows are then discounted. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted average cost of capital. The discount rate used in the 2009 valuation had increased from the discount rate used in 2008, which reflects an increase in stock volatility and higher risk and uncertainty related to health care reform. Market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including membership, revenue, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and book value as well as market capitalization analysis of WellPoint and other comparable companies. 74 Table of Contents While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income. For additional information, see Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, included in this Form 10-K. Investments Current and long-term available-for-sale investment securities were $17.0 billion at December 31, 2009 and represented 33% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2009. In accordance with FASB guidance for debt and equity investments, we classify fixed maturity and equity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” or “trading” and report those securities at fair value. Prior to the April 1, 2009 adoption of FASB guidance for recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairment, or FASB OTTI guidance, as discussed below, we classified our fixed maturity securities as current or noncurrent based on their contractual maturities. In connection with the adoption of FASB OTTI guidance on April 1, 2009, we have determined that certain of these fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, have classified such investments as current assets as of December 31, 2009 without regard to their contractual maturities. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity. Investment income is recorded when earned, and realized gains or losses, determined by specific identification of investments sold, are included in income when securities are sold. We review investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. In addition, for equity securities, we determine whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time to allow for a recovery of its fair value above its carrying amount. If any declines of equity securities are determined to be other-than-temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made. In April 2009, the FASB issued its OTTI guidance, which applies to fixed maturity securities only and provides new guidance on the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments. Furthermore, the FASB OTTI guidance requires additional disclosures related to other-than-temporary impairments. Under this revised guidance, if a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and is recorded to other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income in our consolidated income statements. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, the credit component of the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income in our consolidated income statements and the non-credit component of the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in other comprehensive income. 75 Table of Contents The credit component of an other-than temporary impairment is determined by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of acquisition. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other debt securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings, and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by interest rate and other non-credit factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Upon adoption of FASB OTTI guidance on April 1, 2009, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment, net of taxes, of $88.9 million as of the beginning of the period of adoption, April 1, 2009, to reclassify the non-credit component of a previously recognized other-than-temporary impairment from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income. The unrealized gains or losses on our equity and fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. We have a committee of certain accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. The current economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income totaled $450.2 million, $1.2 billion and $259.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. There were no individually significant other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments by issuer during the years ended December 31, 2009 or 2007. The significant other-than-temporary impairments recognized during 2008 primarily related to our investments in Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Lehman (or their respective subsidiaries, as appropriate), as discussed below. Our equity securities at December 31, 2008 included investments in stock, largely preferred stock, of the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Market concerns during the third quarter of 2008 related to those entities’ financial condition and liquidity prompted the U.S. government to seize control of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Any potential recovery of the fair value of these securities was dependent on a number of factors and was not expected in the near term. These facts, together with the significant declines in the fair value of these securities, led us to conclude that they were other-than-temporarily impaired. Accordingly, during 2008, we recorded $135.0 million and $106.6 million of realized losses from other-than-temporary impairments related to our equity security investments in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, respectively. Our fixed maturity securities included investments in Lehman at December 31, 2008. On September 15, 2008, Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, recovery of our investments, if any, was deemed remote and we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment of $90.2 million during 2008. In addition, other-than-temporary impairments recognized in 2008 included charges for fixed maturity securities and equity securities for which, due to credit downgrades and/or the extent and duration of their decline in fair value in light of the then current market conditions, we determined that the impairment was deemed other-than-temporary. These securities covered a number of industries, led by the banking and financial services sectors. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $184.6 million of gross unrealized losses on investments recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, $173.4 million of which related to fixed maturity securities and $11.2 million of which related to equity securities. 76 Table of Contents We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. This could result in other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments being charged against future income. Given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional, material other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments may be recorded in future periods. A primary objective in the management of fixed maturity and equity portfolios is to maximize total return relative to underlying liabilities and respective liquidity needs. In achieving this goal, assets may be sold to take advantage of market conditions or other investment opportunities as well as tax considerations. Sales will generally produce realized gains and losses. In the ordinary course of business, we may sell securities at a loss for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the investment environment; (ii) expectation that the fair value could deteriorate further; (iii) desire to reduce exposure to an issuer or an industry; (iv) changes in credit quality; or (v) changes in expected cash flow. We maintain various rabbi trusts to account for the assets and liabilities under certain deferred compensation plans. Under these deferred compensation plans, the participants can defer certain types of compensation and elect to receive a return on the deferred amounts based on the changes in fair value of various investment options, primarily a variety of mutual funds. We also generally purchase corporate-owned life insurance policies on participants in the deferred compensation plans. The cash surrender value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies is reported in “Other invested assets, long-term” in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in cash surrender value is reported as an offset to the premium expense of the policies, classified as general and administrative expenses. In addition to available-for-sale investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $775.3 million, or 1% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2009. These long-term investments consist primarily of real estate, cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and certain other investments. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term. We participate in securities lending programs whereby marketable securities in our investment portfolio are transferred to independent brokers or dealers based on, among other things, their creditworthiness in exchange for cash collateral initially equal to at least 102% of the value of the securities on loan and is thereafter maintained at a minimum of 100% of the market value of the securities loaned (calculated as the ratio of initial market value of cash collateral to current market value of the securities on loan). Accordingly, the market value of the securities on loan to each borrower is monitored daily and the borrower is required to deliver additional cash collateral if the market value of the securities on loan exceeds the initial market value of cash collateral delivered. Under FASB guidance for transfers and servicing, we recognize the collateral as an asset, which is reported as “securities lending collateral” on our consolidated balance sheets and we record a corresponding liability for the obligation to return the collateral to the borrower, which is reported as “securities lending payable”. The securities on loan are reported in the applicable investment category on the consolidated balance sheets. Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage the market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits of investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future earnings and financial position. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $15.9 billion at December 31, 2009. The weighted-average credit rating of these securities was “AA” as of December 31, 2009. Included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities and corporate securities of $2.4 billion, $57.1 million and $4.3 million, respectively, that are guaranteed by third parties. With the exception of 15 securities with a fair value of $54.9 million, these securities 77 Table of Contents are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2009 with a guarantee by a third party. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities without the guarantee was “AA” as of December 31, 2009 for the securities for which such information is available. At December 31, 2009, we owned $3.5 billion of mortgage-backed securities and $304.0 million of asset-backed securities out of a total available-for-sale investment portfolio of $17.0 billion. These securities included sub-prime and Alt-A securities with fair values of $107.5 million and $285.9 million, respectively. These sub-prime and Alt-A securities had net unrealized losses of $14.8 million and $38.1 million, respectively. The average credit rating of the sub-prime and Alt-A securities was “A” and “BBB”, respectively. Fair values of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs, in accordance with FASB guidance, for the determination of fair value to facilitate fair value measurements and disclosures. We obtain only one quoted price for each security from third party pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. For securities not actively traded, the third party pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform monthly analysis on the prices received from third parties to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes a review of month to month price fluctuations. If unusual fluctuations are noted in this review, we may obtain additional information from other pricing services to validate the quoted price. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from third party pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 that were material to the consolidated financial statements. In certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. Such securities are designated Level III in accordance with FASB guidance. Securities designated Level III at December 31, 2009 totaled $351.3 million and represented 2% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level III securities primarily consist of certain mortgage-backed, asset-backed and corporate inverse floating rate securities that were thinly traded or not traded at all due to concerns in the securities markets and the resulting lack of liquidity. In addition, one or more of the inputs used to determine the securities’ fair value, including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields, became unobservable, and the fair values of those securities were estimated using internal estimates for those unobservable inputs. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, of this Form 10-K, and Notes 4 and 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, included in this Form 10-K. Retirement Benefits Pension Benefits We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for some of our employees. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FASB guidance for retirement benefits, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by the guidance, we calculate the value of plan assets as described below. Further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods. 78 Table of Contents An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our December 31, 2009 measurement date, we selected a long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00% for all plans, which is consistent with our prior year assumption of 8.00%. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and an average of historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase. This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date (December 31, 2009). The selected discount rate for all plans is 5.36%, which was developed using a yield curve approach. Using yields available on high-quality fixed maturity securities with various maturity dates, the yield curve approach provides a “customized” rate, which is meant to match the expected cash flows of our specific benefit plans. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with the guidance. In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities, equity securities and alternative investments across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow. The target allocation for pension benefit plan assets is 54% equity securities, 35% fixed maturity securities, and 11% to all other types of investments. No plan assets were invested in WellPoint common stock as of the measurement date. For the year ended December 31, 2009, no material contributions were required to meet the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, minimum required funding levels; however, we made tax deductible discretionary contributions totaling $103.6 million to the defined benefit pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009 our consolidated net pension liabilities were $48.0 million, including liabilities of $65.2 million for certain supplemental plans. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recognized consolidated pretax pension credit of $27.8 million, $27.0 million, and $12.9 million, respectively. Other Postretirement Benefits We provide most associates with certain life, medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions including a discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits. We recognized a postretirement benefit liability of $487.4 million at December 31, 2009. We recognized consolidated pre-tax other postretirement expense of $33.8 million, $30.7 million, and $36.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 79 Table of Contents At our December 31, 2009 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 5.79% (compared to a discount rate of 5.73% for 2009 expense recognition). We developed this rate using a yield curve approach as described above. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of other benefits at our December 31, 2009 measurement dates was 8.50% for 2010 with a gradual decline to 5.00% by the year 2017. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2009 by $45.8 million and would increase service and interest costs by $2.6 million. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by $39.0 million as of December 31, 2009 and would decrease service and interest costs by $2.2 million. We made tax deductible discretionary contributions totaling $85.0 million to the other postretirement benefit plans during the year ended December 31, 2009. For additional information regarding retirement benefits, see Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, included in this Form 10-K. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or Codification, as the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements. This guidance was included in the Codification under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 105. Rules and interpretive releases of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification became effective for us on September 30, 2009 and supersedes all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other non-grandfathered non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification became non-authoritative. The Codification does not change or alter existing GAAP, and, therefore, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued FASB ASC paragraphs 810-10-30-7 and 810-10-30-8 through -8D, Consolidation—Initial Measurement-Variable Interest Entities, or FASB ASC paragraphs 810-10-30-7 through -8D. FASB ASC paragraphs 810-10-30-7 through -8D amends FASB ASC Section 810-10-25, Consolidation—Recognition (FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)) to require an entity to perform an analysis to determine whether the entity’s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. FASB ASC paragraphs 810-10-30-7 through -8D were effective for us beginning on January 1, 2010. The adoption of FASB ASC paragraphs 810-10-30-7 through -8D effective January 1, 2010 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued FASB ASC paragraphs 860-10-40-5 and 860-10-40-6A, Transfers and Servicing-Derecognition—Criteria for Sale of Financial Assets, or FASB ASC paragraphs 860-10-40-5 and -6A. FASB ASC paragraphs 860-10-40-5 and -6A is intended to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that an entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of a transfer on its financial position, financial performance, and cash flows; and a transferor’s continuing involvement, if any, in transferred financial assets. FASB ASC paragraphs 860-10-40-5 and -6A were effective for us beginning on January 1, 2010. The adoption of FASB ASC paragraphs 860-10-40-5 and -6A effective January 1, 2010 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In May 2009, the FASB issued FASB ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events, or FASB ASC Topic 855, which establishes standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before 80 Table of Contents financial statements are issued. Entities are required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated and the basis for that date. FASB ASC Topic 855 was effective for us on a prospective basis for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. We adopted FASB ASC Topic 855 on June 30, 2009. The adoption of FASB ASC 855 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and required disclosures. In April 2009, the FASB issued FASB ASC paragraph 820-10-65-4, Transition Related to FASB Staff Position FAS 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly, or FASB ASC paragraph 820-10-65-4. FASB ASC paragraph 820-10-65-4 provides additional authoritative guidance to assist both issuers and users of financial statements in determining whether a market is active or inactive, and whether a transaction is distressed. FASB ASC paragraph 820-10-65-4 was effective for us on April 1, 2009. The adoption of FASB ASC paragraph 820-10-65-4 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In April 2009, the FASB issued FASB ASC paragraph 825-10-65-1, Transition Related to FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 128-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, or FASB ASC paragraph 825-10-65-1. FASB ASC paragraph 825-10-65-1 requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements. FASB ASC paragraph 825-10-65-1 was effective for us on June 30, 2009. The adoption of FASB ASC paragraph 825-10-65-1 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In March 2008, the FASB issued FASB ASC paragraph 815-10-65-1, Transition and Effective Date Related to FASB No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, or FASB ASC paragraph 815-10-65-1. FASB ASC paragraph 815-10-65-1 requires expanded disclosures regarding the location and amounts of derivative instruments in an entity’s financial statements, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or FASB ASC Topic 815, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, operating results and cash flows. FASB ASC Topic 815 was effective for us on January 1, 2009. The adoption of FASB ASC Topic 815 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. For additional information regarding our disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, included in this Form 10-K. There were no other new accounting pronouncements issued during the year ended December 31, 2009 that had a material impact on our financial position, operating results or disclosures. X. Liquidity and Capital Resources Introduction Our cash receipts result primarily from premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on long-term borrowings, capital expenditures and repurchases of our common stock. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have some negative impact on our liquidity. We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy. 81 Table of Contents A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities, to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. Credit markets have experienced a tightening of available liquidity, primarily as a result of uncertainty surrounding the economic crisis and the resulting volatility experienced in the debt and equity markets. Beginning in October 2008, the Federal government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to restore liquidity in the financial markets and to help relieve the credit crisis and strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. In addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide liquidity and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions. We have a $2.5 billion commercial paper program. We continue to monitor the commercial paper markets due to recent volatility and disruption in the markets and will act in a prudent manner. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we intend to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our $2.4 billion senior credit facility to redeem our commercial paper when it matures. While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we believe the lenders participating in our credit facility will be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. In addition to the $2.4 billion senior credit facility, we expect to receive approximately $2.3 billion of ordinary dividends from our subsidiaries during 2010, which also provides further operating and financial flexibility. The table below outlines the cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,038.9 $ 2,535.4 $ 4,344.6 Investing activities 3,002.8 616.2 (768.9 ) Financing activities (3,402.8 ) (3,735.6 ) (3,409.9 ) Effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (6.7 ) — — Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 2,632.2 $ (584.0 ) $ 165.8 Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 During 2009, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $3.0 billion, compared to $2.5 billion in 2008, an increase of $0.5 billion. This increase in operating cash flow compared to 2008 was driven primarily by the favorable net change in provider advances, decreased tax payments, lower experience-rated refunds to certain large customers and decreased incentive compensation payments. These favorable operating cash flow drivers were partially offset by unfavorable operating cash flows related to the transition of the PBM business to Express Scripts, higher discretionary benefit plan contributions and the delay in receipt of certain State-Sponsored business premiums until early 2010. Net cash flow provided by investing activities was $3.0 billion in 2009, compared to $616.2 million in 2008. The increase in cash flow provided by investing activities of $2.4 billion from 2008 primarily resulted from the 82 Table of Contents cash proceeds from the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts and decreases in purchases of subsidiaries, partially offset by increases in net purchases of investments, decreases in securities lending collateral and increases in net purchases of property and equipment. Net cash flow used in financing activities was $3.4 billion in 2009 compared to $3.7 billion in 2008. The decrease in cash flow used in financing activities of $332.8 million primarily resulted from decreases in the repurchase of common stock and decreases in securities lending payable, partially offset by increases in the net repayments of borrowings and an increase in bank overdrafts. Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 During 2008, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion, compared to $4.3 billion in 2007, a decrease of $1.8 billion. This decrease resulted primarily from lower net income in 2008 compared to 2007, increases in accounts receivables and lower tax deductions related to reduced stock option exercises. The increase in accounts receivable was due to self-funded membership growth and higher amounts due from providers. The reduction in net income reflects higher medical costs. Net cash flow provided by investing activities was $616.2 million in 2008, compared to $768.9 million of cash used in 2007. The increase in cash flow provided by investing activities of $1.4 billion between the two periods primarily resulted from decreases in net purchases of investments, decreases in purchases of subsidiaries, and decreases in securities lending collateral, partially offset by increases in net purchases of property and equipment. Net cash flow used in financing activities was $3.7 billion in 2008 compared to $3.4 billion in 2007. The increase in cash flow used in financing activities of $325.7 million primarily resulted from increases in net repayments of borrowings, including commercial paper, a decrease in securities lending payable, a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchase plan and a decrease in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by decreases in the repurchase of common stock and an increase in bank overdrafts. Financial Condition We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, of $22.6 billion at December 31, 2009. Since December 31, 2008, total cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, increased by $5.2 billion primarily due to cash proceeds from the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts, net change in provider advances, decreased tax payments, lower experience-rated refunds to certain large customers and decreased incentive compensation payments. Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. In addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2009, we held at the parent company approximately $4.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents and investments, which is available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, share and debt repurchases and interest payments. Our consolidated debt-to-total capital ratio (calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt plus shareholders’ equity) was 25.3% as of December 31, 2009 and 29.2% as of December 31, 2008. Our senior debt is rated “A-” by Standard & Poor’s, “A-” by Fitch, Inc., “Baa1” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. A significant downgrade in our debt ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs. 83 Table of Contents Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity On December 1, 2009, we sold our PBM business to Express Scripts and received $4.7 billion in cash. We expect to pay cash tax payments of approximately $1.2 billion during the first quarter of 2010 related to the PBM sale, which will be included in our net cash flows provided by operations for the quarter ending March 31, 2010. On December 12, 2008, we filed an updated shelf registration statement with the SEC to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt, capitalization of our subsidiaries, repurchases of our common stock or the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion. We are a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, collectively, the FHLBs, and as a member we have the ability to obtain cash advances subject to certain requirements. In order to obtain cash advances, we are required to pledge securities as collateral to the FHLBs, initially equal to a certain percentage of the cash borrowings, depending on the type of securities pledged as collateral. The market value of the collateral is monitored daily by the FHLBs, and if it falls below the required percentage of the cash borrowings, we are required to pledge additional securities as collateral or repay a portion of the outstanding cash advance balance. In addition, our borrowings may be limited based on the amount of our investment in the FHLBs’ common stock. Our investment in the FHLBs’ common stock at December 31, 2009 totaled $9.4 million, which is reported in “Investments available-for-sale—Equity securities” on the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, $0.0 million and $98.0 million, respectively, of cash advances from the FHLBs was outstanding and is reported in “Short-term borrowings” on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities, primarily certain U.S. government sponsored mortgage-backed securities, with a fair value of $230.5 million at December 31, 2009 have been pledged as collateral. The securities pledged are reported in “Investments available-for-sale—Fixed maturity securities” on the consolidated balance sheets. On November 29, 2005, we entered into a senior revolving credit facility, or the facility, with certain lenders for general corporate purposes. The facility, as amended, provides credit up to $2.4 billion and matures on September 30, 2011. The interest rate on this facility is based on either: (i) the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined percentage rate based on our credit rating at the date of utilization, or (ii) a base rate as defined in the facility agreement. Our ability to borrow under this facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2009 or during the year then ended. At December 31, 2009, we had $2.4 billion available under this facility. We have our Board of Directors’ approval to borrow up to $2.5 billion under our commercial paper program. Proceeds from any issuance of commercial paper may be used for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of our debt and common stock. Commercial paper notes are short-term senior unsecured notes, with a maturity not to exceed 270 days from date of issuance. When issued, the notes bear interest at the then current market rates. We had $0.5 billion of borrowings outstanding under this commercial paper program as of December 31, 2009. As previously discussed in “Introduction to Liquidity and Capital Resources”, the commercial paper markets have experienced increased volatility and disruption. We will continue to monitor the commercial paper markets and will act in a prudent manner. We continue to classify our commercial paper as long-term debt given our intent to issue commercial paper or our ability to redeem our commercial paper using our $2.4 billion senior credit facility. As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we are currently estimating approximately $2.3 billion of ordinary dividends to be paid to the parent company during 2010. During 2009, we received $5.7 billion of dividends from our subsidiaries. 84 Table of Contents We regularly review the appropriate use of capital. Accordingly, under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. The repurchases are effected from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased and retired approximately 57.3 million shares at an average per share price of $46.02, for an aggregate cost of $2.6 billion. On March 5, 2009, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of $1.5 billion in our stock repurchase program. On October 23, 2009, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase of $0.5 billion in our stock repurchase program, subject to completion of the Express Scripts transaction and pending current market conditions and industry issues. As of December 31, 2009, $0.4 billion remained authorized for future repurchases. On January 26, 2010 our Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by $3.5 billion. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we repurchased and retired approximately 6.5 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $0.4 billion, leaving approximately $3.5 billion for authorized future repurchases at February 10, 2010. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares when we believe it is a prudent use of capital. Our current retirement benefits funding strategy is to fund an amount at least equal to the minimum required funding as determined under ERISA with consideration of maximum tax deductible amounts. We may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2009, no contributions were required to meet ERISA required funding levels; however, we made tax deductible discretionary contributions totaling $188.6 million to our retirement benefit plans during the year ended December 31, 2009. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2009 are as follows: Total Payments Due by Period Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 Years (In millions) Long-term debt, including capital leases1 $ 13,570.2 $ 1,042.6 $ 3,094.8 $ 1,568.8 $ 7,864.0 Operating lease commitments 695.8 126.8 207.3 165.4 196.3 Projected other postretirement benefits 710.4 41.0 142.6 147.2 379.6 Purchase obligations: IBM outsourcing agreements2 671.8 248.4 391.5 31.9 — Other purchase obligations3 1,477.1 514.9 588.3 293.5 80.4 Other long-term liabilities4 924.4 — 361.3 355.7 207.4 Venture capital commitments 179.2 69.8 81.3 28.1 — Total contractual obligations and commitments $ 18,228.9 $ 2,043.5 $ 4,867.1 $ 2,590.6 $ 8,727.7 1 Includes estimated interest expense. 2 Relates to agreements with International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, to provide information technology infrastructure services. See Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 included in this Form 10-K for further information. 3 Includes obligations related to non-IBM information technology service agreements and telecommunication contracts. 4 Estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from this table as we had no funding requirements under ERISA at December 31, 2009, as a result of the value of the assets in the plans. The above table does not contain $144.5 million of gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities. See Note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 included in this Form 10-K for further information. 85 Table of Contents In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our senior credit facility or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions. For additional information on our debt and lease commitments, see Notes 12 and 17, respectively, to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, included in this Form 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that will require funding in future periods. Risk-Based Capital Our regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies largely based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’, or NAIC’s, RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under this Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our risk-based capital as of December 31, 2009, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, was in excess of all mandatory RBC thresholds. In addition to exceeding the RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries. XI. Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 This document contains certain forward-looking information about us that is intended to be covered by the safe harbor for “forward-looking statements” provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures in our SEC reports. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2009. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return. Investments Our investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk. The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit downgrade to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that downgrade. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately “AA”. Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which represent an exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value. Our portfolio includes corporate securities (approximately 41% of the total fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2009), which are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. This risk is managed through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately “A-”. 87 Table of Contents Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systematic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 94% of our available-for-sale investments were fixed maturity securities. Market risk is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $691.4 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $707.4 million increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly. Our available-for-sale equity securities portfolio, as of December 31, 2009, was approximately 6% of our investments. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $104.3 million. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $104.3 million. Long-Term Debt Our total long-term debt at December 31, 2009 was $8.4 billion, and included $500.6 million of commercial paper and $433.1 million outstanding on a senior term loan. The carrying values of the commercial paper and senior term loan approximate fair value as the underlying instruments have variable interest rates at market value. The remainder of the debt is subject to interest rate risk as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2009, we had $7.4 billion of senior unsecured notes with fixed interest rates. These notes, at par value, included $700.0 million at 5.000% due 2011, $350.0 million at 6.375% due 2012, $800.0 million at 6.80% due 2012, $500.0 million at 5.00% due 2014, $400.0 million at 6.00% due 2014, $1,100.0 million at 5.250% due 2016, $700.0 million at 5.875% due 2017, $600.0 million at 7.000% due 2019, $500.0 million at 5.950% due 2034, $900.0 million at 5.850% due 2036, and $800.0 million at 6.375% due 2037. These notes had combined carrying and estimated fair value of $7.4 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009. Our subordinated debt includes surplus notes issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries. Par value of amounts outstanding at December 31, 2009 included $42.0 million of 9.125% surplus notes due 2010 and $25.1 million of 9.000% surplus notes due 2027. Any payment of interest or principal on the surplus notes may be made only with the prior approval of the Indiana Department of Insurance. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the surplus notes were $66.8 million and $73.4 million at December 31, 2009. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. Derivatives We use derivative financial instruments, specifically interest rate swap agreements, to hedge exposure to interest rate risk on our borrowings. These derivatives are also subject to credit quality risk from the counterparty. Our derivative use is generally limited to hedging purposes and we generally do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. 88 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2009, we entered into a fair value hedge with a total notional value of $600.0 million. The hedge is an interest rate swap agreement to receive a fixed 5.000% rate and pay a LIBOR-based floating rate and expires on January 15, 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we terminated two interest rate swaps of our fixed rate debt for which the counterparty was Lehman. Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection on September 15, 2008. We recognized a $2.1 million impairment of these fair value hedges as net realized losses on investments during the year ended December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we entered into two fair value hedges with a total notional value of $440.0 million. The first hedge is a $240.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to receive a fixed 6.800% rate and pay a LIBOR-based floating rate and expires on August 1, 2012. The second hedge is a $200.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to receive a fixed 5.000% rate and pay a LIBOR-based floating rate and expires on December 15, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we entered into two fair value hedges with a total notional value of $660.0 million. The first hedge is a $360.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 6.800% rate for a LIBOR-based floating rate and expires on August 1, 2012. The second hedge is a $300.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 5.000% rate for LIBOR-based floating rate and expires December 15, 2014. Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these swap agreements. As of December 31, 2009, we recorded an asset of $84.8 million, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swap’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $39.7 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $39.7 million increase in fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we entered into a series of forward starting pay fixed swaps with total outstanding notional amounts of $295.0 million. The objective of these series of hedges is to eliminate the variability of the cash flows in the interest payments on our senior term loan. We agreed to receive a LIBOR-based floating rate and pay a fixed rate. The swaps began to expire on a monthly basis on December 31, 2009; the final swap in the series expires on June 30, 2010. In January 2009, we entered into forward starting pay fixed swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $800.0 million. The objective of these hedges was to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the interest payments on the debt securities issued in February 2009. These swaps were terminated in February 2009, and we paid a net $3.2 million, the net fair value at the time of termination. In addition, we recorded a loss of $2.1 million, net of tax, in other comprehensive income. Following the February 5, 2009 issuance of debt securities, the unamortized fair value of the forward starting pay fixed swaps included in accumulated other comprehensive income began amortizing into earnings, as an increase to interest expense. In addition, we have amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income for certain forward starting pay fixed swaps that were terminated in prior years. The hedged debt securities have maturity dates ranging from 2014 to 2036. The unrecognized loss for all cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2009 was $10.8 million. As of December 31, 2009, the total amount of amortization over the next twelve months for all cash flow hedges will decrease interest expense by approximately $0.9 million. 89 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:53:10.199010

Products and Services A general description of our products and services is provided below: Preferred Provider Organization. PPO products offer the member an option to select any health care provider, with benefits reimbursed by us at a higher level when care is received from a participating network provider. Coverage is subject to co-payments or deductibles and coinsurance, with member cost sharing usually limited by out-of-pocket maximums. Consumer-Driven Health Plans. CDHPs provide consumers with increased financial responsibility, choice and control regarding how their health care dollars are spent. Generally, CDHPs combine a high-deductible PPO plan with an employer-funded and/or employee-funded personal care account, which may result in tax benefits to the employee. Some or all of the dollars remaining in the personal care account at year-end can be rolled over to the next year for future health care needs. Traditional Indemnity. Indemnity products offer the member an option to select any health care provider for covered services. Coverage is subject to deductibles and coinsurance, with member cost sharing usually limited by out-of-pocket maximums. Health Maintenance Organization. HMO products include comprehensive managed care benefits, generally through a participating network of physicians, hospitals and other providers. A member in one of our HMOs must typically select a primary care physician, or PCP, from our network. PCPs generally are family practitioners, internists or pediatricians who provide necessary preventive and primary medical care, and are generally responsible for coordinating other necessary health care services. We offer HMO plans with varying levels of co-payments, which result in different levels of premium rates. Point-of-Service. POS products blend the characteristics of HMO, PPO and indemnity plans. Members can have comprehensive HMO-style benefits through participating network providers with minimum out-of-pocket expenses (co-payments) and also can go directly, without a referral, to any provider they choose, subject to, among other things, certain deductibles and coinsurance. Member cost sharing is limited by out-of-pocket maximums. 10 Table of Contents Administrative Services. In addition to fully-insured products, we provide administrative services to large group employers that maintain self-funded health plans. These administrative services include underwriting, actuarial services, medical management, claims processing and other administrative services for self-funded employers. Self-funded health plans are also able to use our provider networks and to realize savings through our negotiated provider arrangements, while allowing employers the ability to design certain health benefit plans in accordance with their own requirements and objectives. We also underwrite stop loss insurance for self-funded plans. BlueCard. BlueCard host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer sponsored health plan serviced by a non-WellPoint controlled BCBS licensee, who is the “home” plan. We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard host members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Senior Plans. We offer a wide variety of senior plans, products and options such as Medicare supplement plans, Medicare Advantage (including private fee-for-service plans) and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans, or Medicare Part D. Medicare supplement plans typically pay the difference between health care costs incurred by a beneficiary and amounts paid by Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans provide Medicare beneficiaries with a managed care alternative to traditional Medicare and often include a Medicare Part D benefit. Medicare Part D offers a prescription drug plan to Medicare and dual eligible (Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries. We offer these plans to customers through our health benefit subsidiaries throughout the country. Individual Plans. We offer a full range of health insurance plans with a variety of options and deductibles for individuals under age 65 who are not covered by employer-sponsored coverage. Some of our products target certain demographic populations such as the uninsured, “young invincibles,” (individuals between the ages of 19 and 29), families and those transitioning between jobs or early retirees. Medicaid Plans and Other State-Sponsored Programs. We have contracts to serve members enrolled in Medicaid, State Children’s Health Insurance programs and other publicly funded health care programs for low income and/or high medical risk individuals. We provide services in California, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, New York, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Pharmacy Products. Until December 1, 2009, we offered pharmacy and PBM services directly to our members through our PBM subsidiaries. Subsequent to the December 1, 2009 sale of our PBM subsidiaries, these services are now managed for us by Express Scripts under our ten-year contract. Pharmacy services incorporate features such as drug formularies, a pharmacy network and maintenance of a prescription drug database and mail order capabilities. PBM services include management of drug utilization through outpatient prescription drug formularies, retrospective review and drug education for physicians, pharmacists and members. Two of our PBM subsidiaries were licensed pharmacies and made prescription dispensing services available through mail order for PBM clients. Our PBM companies also included Precision Rx Specialty Solutions, a full service specialty pharmacy designed to help improve quality and cost of care by coordinating a relatively new class of prescription medications commonly referred to as biopharmaceuticals, also known as specialty medications. Life Insurance. We offer an array of competitive individual and group life insurance benefit products to both large and small group customers in conjunction with our health plans. The life products include term life and accidental death and dismemberment. Disability. We offer short-term and long-term disability programs, usually in conjunction with our health plans. Behavioral Health. We offer specialized behavioral health plans and benefit management. These plans cover mental health and substance abuse treatment services on both an inpatient and an outpatient basis. We have implemented employee assistance and behavioral managed care programs for a wide variety of businesses throughout the United States. These programs are offered through our subsidiaries. 11 Table of Contents Radiology Benefit Management. We offer outpatient diagnostic imaging management services to health plans. These services include utilization management for advanced diagnostic imaging procedures, network development and optimization, patient safety, claims adjudication and provider payment. Personal Health Care Guidance. We offer leading analytics-driven personal health care guidance. These services help improve the quality, coordination and safety of health care, enhance communications between patients and their physicians, and reduce medical costs. Dental. Our dental plans include networks in certain states in which we operate. Many of the dental benefits are provided to customers enrolled in our health plans and are offered on both a fully-insured and self-funded basis. Additionally, we offer managed dental services to other health care plans to assist those other health care plans in providing dental benefits to their customers. Vision Services. Our vision plans include networks within the states where we operate. Many of the vision benefits are provided to customers enrolled in our health plans and are offered on both a fully-insured and self-funded basis. Long-Term Care Insurance. We offer long-term care insurance products to our California members through a subsidiary. The long-term care products include tax-qualified and non-tax qualified versions of a skilled nursing home care plan and comprehensive policies covering skilled, intermediate and custodial long-term care and home health services. Medicare Administrative Operations. Through our subsidiary, NGS, we serve as a fiscal intermediary, carrier and Medicare administrative contractor providing administrative services for the Medicare program, which generally provides coverage for persons who are 65 or older and for persons who are disabled or with end-stage renal disease. Part A of the Medicare program provides coverage for services provided by hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and other health care facilities. Part B of the Medicare program provides coverage for services provided by physicians, physical and occupational therapists and other professional providers, as well as certain durable medical equipment and medical supplies. CMS is currently conducting competitive procurements to replace the current fiscal intermediary and carrier contracts with contracts that conform to the Federal Acquisition Regulations. These new contracts, referred to as Medicare Administrative Contracts, or MACs, will combine most of the administrative activities currently performed by the existing intermediaries and carriers. At year end 2010, NGS held two MACs as a prime contractor and supported two MACs as a subcontractor. Compensation under the MACs is on a cost plus award fee basis while compensation under the fiscal intermediary and carrier contracts is on a cost reimbursement basis. Customer Types Our products are generally developed and marketed with an emphasis on the differing needs of our various customers. In particular, our product development and marketing efforts take into account the differing characteristics between the various customers served by us, including individuals, employers, seniors and Medicaid recipients, as well as the unique needs of educational and public entities, labor groups, federal employee health and benefit programs, national employers and state-run programs servicing low-income, high-risk and under-served markets. Each business unit is responsible for product design, pricing, enrolling, underwriting and servicing customers in specific customer types. We believe that one of the keys to our success has been our focus on distinct customer types, which better enables us to develop benefit plans and services that meet our customers’ unique needs. 12 Table of Contents Overall, we seek to establish pricing and product designs to achieve an appropriate level of profitability for each of our customer categories balanced with competitive objectives. As of December 31, 2010, our medical membership customer types included the following categories: • Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. In addition, Local Group includes UniCare local group members. These groups are generally sold through brokers or consultants working with industry specialists from our in-house sales force. Local Group insurance premiums may be based on claims incurred by the group or sold on a self-insured basis. The customer’s buying decision is typically based upon the size and breadth of our networks, customer service, the quality of our medical management services, the administrative cost included in our quoted price, our financial stability, reputation and our ability to effectively service large complex accounts. Local Group accounted for 46% of our medical members at December 31, 2010. • Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 (including UniCare) and their covered dependents. Individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, our in-house sales force or via the Internet. Individual business is sold on a fully-insured basis and is usually medically underwritten at the point of initial issuance. Individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network, and the efficiency of administration. Account turnover is generally higher with Individual as compared to Local Groups. Individual business accounted for 6% of our medical members at December 31, 2010. • National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in a WellPoint service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker relationships. Service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. National Accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. We have a significant advantage when competing for very large National Accounts due to the size and breadth of our networks and our ability to access the national provider networks of BCBS companies and take advantage of their provider discounts in their local markets. National Accounts represented 21% of our medical members at December 31, 2010. • BlueCard host customers represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by WellPoint who receive health care services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-WellPoint controlled BCBSA licensee (i.e., the “home plan”). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard claims received per month. BlueCard host membership accounted for 14% of our medical members at December 31, 2010. • Senior customers are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a managed care alternative for the Medicare program, who have purchased Medicare Supplement benefit coverage, some disabled under 65, or all ages with End Stage Renal Disease. Medicare Supplement policies are sold to Medicare recipients as supplements to the benefits they receive from the Medicare program. Rates are filed with and in some cases approved by state insurance departments. Most of the premium for Medicare Advantage is paid directly by the Federal government on behalf of the participant who may also be charged a small premium. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. Senior business accounted for 4% of our medical members at December 31, 2010. 13 Table of Contents • State-Sponsored membership represents eligible members with State-Sponsored managed care alternatives in Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Plan programs. Total State-Sponsored program business accounted for 5% of our medical members at December 31, 2010. • FEP members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. FEP business accounted for 4% of our medical members at December 31, 2010. In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two principal funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some self-funded customers choose to purchase stop-loss coverage to limit their retained risk. The following tables set forth our medical membership by customer type and funding arrangement: December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Customer Type: Local Group 15,216 15,643 Individual 1,905 2,131 National: National Accounts 7,029 6,813 BlueCard 4,711 4,744 Total National 11,740 11,557 Senior 1,259 1,215 State-Sponsored 1,756 1,733 FEP 1,447 1,391 Total medical membership by customer type 33,323 33,670 Funding Arrangement: Self-Funded 19,590 18,236 Fully-Insured 13,733 15,434 Total medical membership by funding arrangement 33,323 33,670 For additional information regarding the change in medical membership between years, see Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Form 10-K. In addition to the above medical membership, we also serve customers who purchase one or more of our other products or services that are often ancillary to our health business. Examples of these other products or services include life, disease management and wellness, personal health care guidance, radiology benefit management, vision, dental and Medicare Part D. We also provide some of these other products to unaffiliated BCBS or other health plans which contract with us for certain services. Networks and Provider Relations Our relationships with physicians, hospitals and professionals that provide health care services to our members are guided by regional and national standards for network development, reimbursement and contract methodologies. 14 Table of Contents We attempt to provide market-based hospital reimbursement along industry standards. We also seek to ensure that physicians in our network are paid in a timely manner at appropriate rates. We use multi-year contracting strategies, including case or fixed rates, to limit our exposure to medical cost inflation and increase cost predictability. We seek to maintain broad provider networks to ensure member choice, based on both price and access needs, while implementing programs designed to improve the quality of care received by our members. It is generally our philosophy not to delegate full financial responsibility to our physician providers in the form of capitation-based reimbursement. However, in certain markets we believe capitation can be a useful method to lower costs and reduce underwriting risk, and we therefore have some capitation contracts. Depending on the consolidation and integration of physician groups and hospitals, reimbursement strategies vary across markets. Fee-for-service is our predominant reimbursement methodology for physicians. Physician fee schedules are developed at the state level based on an assessment of several factors and conditions, including CMS resource-based relative value system, or RBRVS, changes, medical practice cost inflation and physician supply. We utilize CMS RBRVS fee schedules as a reference point for fee schedule development and analysis. The RBRVS structure was developed and is maintained by CMS, and is used by the Medicare program and other major payers. In addition, we have implemented and continue to expand physician incentive contracting, which recognizes clinical quality and performance as a basis for reimbursement. Our hospital contracts provide for a variety of reimbursement arrangements depending on local market dynamics and current hospital utilization efficiency. Most hospitals are reimbursed a fixed amount per day or per case for inpatient covered services. Some hospitals, primarily sole community hospitals, are reimbursed on a discount from approved charge basis for covered services. Our “per case” reimbursement methods utilize many of the same attributes contained in Medicare’s Diagnosis Related Groups, or DRG, methodology. Hospital outpatient services are reimbursed by fixed case rates, fee schedules or percent of approved charges. Our hospital contracts recognize unique hospital attributes, such as academic medical centers or community hospitals, and the volume of care performed for our members. To improve predictability of expected cost, we frequently use a multi-year contracting approach and have been transitioning to case rate payment methodologies. Many of our hospital contracts have reimbursement linked to improved clinical performance, patient safety and medical error reduction. We are also advancing a number of innovative payment models such as accountable care organizations, or ACO, and patient-centered medical homes, or PCMH, that aim to improve affordability and the quality of care delivered to our members. Under an ACO arrangement, providers receive incentives based on quality, cost, safety and coordination of care metrics. Through this shared risk arrangement, providers share in the savings achieved through better quality and reduced costs, but also share the financial risk if results are not achieved. We are also in the early years of ten PCMH programs in eight of our Blue states. In the PCMH model, physician practices become the medical “home” for members with chronic conditions. These practices help improve quality through enhanced service offerings and better care coordination with other physicians and specialists across the healthcare system. Participating practices receive tiered reimbursement that includes a per member per month management fee and significant quality-based incentives. Medical Management Programs Our medical management programs include a broad array of activities that facilitate improvements in the quality of care provided to our members and promote cost effective medical care. These medical management activities and programs are administered and directed by physicians and trained nurses. One of the goals of our medical management strategies is to ensure that the care delivered to our members is supported by appropriate medical and scientific evidence. 15 Table of Contents Precertification. A traditional medical management program involves assessment of the appropriateness of certain hospitalizations and other medical services prior to the service being rendered. For example, precertification is used to determine whether a set of hospital and medical services is being appropriately applied to the member’s clinical condition, in accordance with criteria for medical necessity as that term is defined in the member’s benefits contract. Most of our health plans have implemented precertification programs for certain high cost radiology studies, addressing an area of historically significant cost trends. As previously described in “Significant Events” herein, on August 1, 2007, we completed our acquisition of AIM. We continue to incorporate AIM’s services and technology for more effective and efficient use of diagnostic imaging services by our members. Concurrent review. Another traditional medical management strategy we use is concurrent review, which is based on nationally recognized criteria developed by third-party medical specialists. With concurrent review, the requirements and intensity of services during a patient’s hospital stay are reviewed, at times by an onsite skilled nurse professional in collaboration with the hospital’s medical and nursing staff, in order to coordinate care and determine the most effective transition of care from the hospital setting. Formulary management. We have developed formularies, which are selections of drugs based on clinical quality and effectiveness. A pharmacy and therapeutics committee of physicians uses scientific and clinical evidence to ensure that our members have access to the appropriate drug therapies. This function remained with us after the sale of our PBM business. Medical policy. A medical policy group comprised of physician leaders from various areas of the country, working in cooperation with academic medical centers, practicing community physicians and medical specialty organizations such as the American College of Radiology and national organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and the American Cancer Society, determines our national policy for the application of new medical technologies and treatments. Quality programs. We are actively engaged with our hospital and physician networks to enable them to improve medical and surgical care and achieve better outcomes for our members. We endorse, encourage and incent hospitals and physicians to support national initiatives to improve the quality of clinical care, patient outcomes and to reduce medication errors and hospital infections. We have demonstrated our leadership in developing hospital quality programs. External review procedures. We work with outside experts through a process of external review to provide our members scientifically and clinically, evidenced-based medical care. When we receive member concerns, we have formal appeals procedures that ultimately allow coverage disputes related to medical necessity decisions under the benefits contract to be settled by independent expert physicians. Service management. In HMO and POS networks, primary care physicians serve as the overall coordinators of members’ health care needs by providing an array of preventive health services and overseeing referrals to specialists for appropriate medical care. In PPO networks, patients have access to network physicians without a primary care physician serving as the coordinator of care. Anthem Care Comparison. We educate members about high-quality, cost-effective procedures that are covered by their benefit plans. Members are able to access via the internet a comparison of the cost of care, quality ratings and benefit levels for common services at specified facilities, including the facility and professional and ancillary service costs. This allows members to make an educated decision about quality and cost before choosing a provider for these common procedures. This tool was recently adopted by the BCBSA and is available in 48 states. Personal Health Care Guidance. These services help improve the quality, coordination and safety of health care, enhance communications between patients and their physicians, and reduce medical costs. Examples of services include member and physician messaging, providing access to evidence-based medical guidelines, physician quality profiling, and other consulting services. 16 Table of Contents Care Management Programs We continue to expand our 360º Health suite of integrated care management programs and tools, offered through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Health Management Corporation. 360º Health offers the following programs, among others, that have been proven to increase quality and reduce medical costs for our members: ConditionCare and FutureMoms are care management and maternity management programs that serve as excellent adjuncts to physician care. A dedicated nurse and added support from our team of dietitians, exercise physiologists, pharmacists, health educators and other health professionals help participants understand their condition, their doctor’s orders and how to become a better self-manager of their condition. 24/7 NurseLine offers access to qualified, registered nurses anytime. This allows our members to make informed decisions about the appropriate level of care and avoid unnecessary worry. This program also includes a robust audiotape library, accessible by phone, with more than 400 health topics, as well as on-line health education topics designed to educate members about symptoms and treatment of many common health concerns. ComplexCare is an advanced care management program that reaches out to participants with multiple health care issues who are at risk for frequent and high levels of medical care in order to offer support and assistance in managing their health care needs. ComplexCare identifies candidates through claims analysis using predictive modeling techniques, the use of health risk assessment data, utilization management reports and referrals from a physician or one of our other programs, such as the 24/7 NurseLine. MyHealth Advantage utilizes integrated information systems and sophisticated data analytics to help our members improve their compliance with evidence-based care guidelines, providing personal care notes that alert members to potential gaps in care, enable more prudent health care choices, and assist in the realization of member out-of-pocket cost savings. MyHealth Coach provides our members with a professional guide who helps them navigate the health care system and make better decisions about their well-being. MyHealth Coach proactively reaches out to people who are at risk for serious health issues or have complex health care needs. Our health coaches help participants understand and manage chronic conditions, handle any health and wellness related services they need and make smart lifestyle choices. HealthyLifestyles helps employees transform unhealthy habits into positive ones by focusing on behaviors that can have a positive effect on their health and their employer’s financial well-being. HealthyLifestyles programs include smoking cessation, weight management, stress management, physical activity and diet and nutrition. MyHealth@Anthem is our secure web-based solution, complementing other programs by reinforcing telephonic coaching and mail campaigns. The website engages participants in regularly assessing their health status, gives them feedback about their progress, and tracks important health measures such as blood pressure, weight and blood glucose levels. Employee Assistance Programs provide many resources that allow members to balance work and personal life by providing quick and easy access to confidential resources to help meet the challenges of daily life. Examples of services available in person as well as via telephone or internet are counseling for child care, health and wellness, financial issues, legal issues, adoption and daily living. Health Care Quality Initiatives Increasingly, the health care industry is able to define quality health care based on preventive health measurements, outcomes of care and optimal care management for chronic disease. A key to our success has been our ability to work with our network physicians and hospitals to improve the quality and outcomes of the health care services provided to our members. Our ability to promote quality medical care has been recognized by the NCQA, the largest and most respected national accreditation program for managed care health plans. 17 Table of Contents Several quality health care measures, including the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set, or HEDIS, have been incorporated into the oversight certification by NCQA. HEDIS measures range from preventive services, such as screening mammography and pediatric immunization, to elements of care, including decreasing the complications of diabetes and improving treatment for patients with heart disease. For the HMO and POS plans, NCQA’s highest accreditation is granted only to those plans that demonstrate levels of service and clinical quality that meet or exceed NCQA’s rigorous requirements for consumer protection and quality improvement. Plans earning this accreditation level must also achieve HEDIS results that are in the highest range of national or regional performance. For the PPO plans, NCQA’s highest accreditation is granted to those plans that have excellent programs for quality improvement and consumer protection and that meet or exceed NCQA’s standards. Overall, our managed care plans have been rated “Excellent,” the highest accreditation, by NCQA. We have committed to measuring our progress in improving the quality of care that our members and our communities receive through our proprietary Member Health Index, or MHI, and State Health Index, or SHI. The MHI is comprised of 23 clinically relevant measures for our health plan members and combines prevention, care management, clinical outcome and patient safety metrics. The SHI measures the health of all the residents in our BCBSA licensed states, not just our members, using public data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Our wholly-owned clinical research and health outcomes research subsidiary, HealthCore, has supported biopharmaceutical manufacturers, health professionals, and health plans by enabling more effective medical management and increased physician adherence to evidence based care, and creating new knowledge on the value of clinical therapies, resulting in better care decisions. Our wholly-owned radiology management subsidiary, AIM, has supported quality by implementing utilization management programs for advanced imaging procedures that are based on widely accepted clinical guidelines. These programs promote the most appropriate use of these procedures to improve the quality of overall health care delivered to our members and members of other health plans that are covered under AIM’s programs. In addition to utilization management, AIM has also implemented its OptiNet® program, which promotes more informed selection of diagnostic imaging facilities by providing cost and facility information to physicians at the point that a procedure is ordered. AIM also provides education on radiation exposure associated with advanced diagnostic procedures to members and physicians. Our wholly-owned analytics-driven personal health care guidance subsidiary, Resolution Health, Inc., has supported quality by helping our members take action to get healthy, stay healthy and better manage chronic illness. Our analysis of an individual member’s health data identifies opportunities to improve health care quality and safety; we then send personalized messages to the member, their doctor and care manager to take action. For example, our drug safety messages inform a member’s doctor, pharmacist or care manager of potentially dangerous drug-drug, drug-condition, drug-age, or drug-dose interactions identified in our Drug Safety Scan. This helps improve safety, drug effectiveness and medication adherence. Pricing and Underwriting of Our Products We price our products based on our assessment of current health care claim costs and emerging health care cost trends, combined with charges for administrative expenses, risk and profit. We continually review our product designs and pricing guidelines on a national and regional basis so that our products remain competitive and consistent with our profitability goals and strategies. In applying our pricing to each employer group and customer, we maintain consistent, competitive, strict underwriting standards. We employ our proprietary accumulated actuarial data in determining underwriting and pricing parameters. Where allowed by law and regulation, we underwrite individual policies based upon the medical history of the individual applying for coverage, small groups based upon case specific underwriting procedures and large groups based on each group’s aggregate claim experience. Also, we employ credit underwriting procedures with respect to our self-funded products. 18 Table of Contents In most circumstances, our pricing and underwriting decisions follow a prospective rating process in which a fixed premium is determined at the beginning of the contract period. For fully-insured business, any deviation, favorable or unfavorable, from the medical costs assumed in determining the premium is our responsibility. Some of our larger groups employ retrospective rating reviews, where positive experience is partially refunded to the group, and negative experience is charged against a rate stabilization fund established from the group’s favorable experience, or charged against future favorable experience. BCBSA Licenses We have filed for registration of and maintain several service marks, trademarks and trade names at the federal level and in various states in which we operate. We have the exclusive right to use the BCBS names and marks for our health benefits products in California (Blue Cross only), Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (as BCBS in 10 New York City metropolitan and surrounding counties, and as Blue Cross or BCBS in selected upstate counties only), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield or Empire Blue Cross (in our New York service areas). Our license agreements require an annual fee based on enrollment to be paid to the BCBSA. BCBSA is a national trade association of Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees, the primary function of which is to promote and preserve the integrity of the BCBS names and marks, as well as provide certain coordination among the member companies. Each BCBSA licensee is an independent legal organization and is not responsible for obligations of other BCBSA member organizations. We have no right to market products and services using the BCBS names and marks outside of the states in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. We believe that the BCBS names and marks are valuable identifiers of our products and services in the marketplace. The license agreements, which have a perpetual term, contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the BCBS names and marks. Upon termination of the license agreements, we would cease to have the right to use the BCBS names and marks in one or more of the states in which we are authorized to use the marks and the BCBSA could thereafter issue licenses to use the BCBS names and marks in those states to another entity. Events that could cause the termination of a license agreement with the BCBSA include failure to comply with minimum capital requirements imposed by the BCBSA, a change of control or violation of the BCBSA ownership limits on our capital stock, impending financial insolvency, the appointment of a trustee or receiver or the commencement of any action against a licensee seeking its dissolution. The license agreements with the BCBSA contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the BCBS names and marks, including: • minimum capital and liquidity requirements; • enrollment and customer service performance requirements; • participation in programs that provide portability of membership between plans; • disclosures to the BCBSA relating to enrollment and financial conditions; • disclosures as to the structure of the BCBS system in contracts with third parties and in public statements; • plan governance requirements; • a requirement that at least 80% (or, in the case of Blue Cross of California, substantially all) of a licensee’s annual combined net revenue attributable to health benefit plans within its service area must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the BCBS names and marks; 19 Table of Contents • a requirement that at least 66 2/3% of a licensee’s annual combined national revenue attributable to health benefit plans must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the BCBS names and marks; • a requirement that neither a plan nor any of its licensed affiliates may permit an entity other than a plan or a licensed affiliate to obtain control of the plan or the licensed affiliate or to acquire a substantial portion of its assets related to licensable services; • a requirement that limits beneficial ownership of our capital stock to less than 10% for institutional investors and less than 5% for non-institutional investors; • a requirement that we divide our Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms; • a requirement that we guarantee certain contractual and financial obligations of our licensed affiliates; and • a requirement that we indemnify the BCBSA against any claims asserted against it resulting from the contractual and financial obligations of any subsidiary that serves as a fiscal intermediary providing administrative services for Medicare Parts A and B. We believe that we and our licensed affiliates are currently in compliance with these standards. The standards under the license agreements may be modified in certain instances by the BCBSA. Regulation General Our operations are subject to comprehensive and detailed state, federal and international regulation throughout the jurisdictions in which we do business. As discussed below, the regulatory aspects of the U.S. health care system will be significantly affected by health care reform legislation. Supervisory agencies, including state health, insurance and corporation departments, have broad authority to: • grant, suspend and revoke licenses to transact business; • regulate many aspects of our products and services; • monitor our solvency and reserve adequacy; and • scrutinize our investment activities on the basis of quality, diversification and other quantitative criteria. To carry out these tasks, these regulators periodically examine our operations and accounts. Regulation of Insurance Company and HMO Business Activity The federal government, as well as the governments of the states in which we conduct our operations, have adopted laws and regulations that govern our business activities in various ways. Further, we expect that health care reform legislation will result in increased federal regulation that could have a significant impact on our business. These laws and regulations, which vary significantly by state, may restrict how we conduct our businesses and may result in additional burdens and costs to us. Areas of governmental regulation include but are not limited to: • medical loss ratios; • tax deductibility of certain compensation; • licensure; • premium rates; • underwriting and pricing; 20 Table of Contents • benefits; • eligibility requirements; • guaranteed renewability; • service areas; • market conduct; • sales and marketing activities; • quality assurance procedures; • plan design and disclosures, including mandated benefits; • underwriting, marketing and rating restrictions for small group products; • utilization review activities; • prompt payment of claims; • member rights and responsibilities; • collection, access or use of protected health information; • data reporting, including financial data and standards for electronic transactions; • payment of dividends; • provider rates of payment; • surcharges on provider payments; • provider contract forms; • provider access standards; • premium taxes and assessments for the uninsured and/or underinsured; • member and provider complaints and appeals; • financial condition (including reserves and minimum capital or risk based capital requirements and investments); • reimbursement or payment levels for government funded business; and • corporate governance. These laws and regulations are subject to amendments and changing interpretations in each jurisdiction. Our Medicare plans, Medicaid plans and other State-Sponsored programs are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations. States generally require health insurers and HMOs to obtain a certificate of authority prior to commencing operations. If we were to establish a health insurance company or an HMO in any jurisdiction where we do not presently operate, we generally would have to obtain such a certificate. The time necessary to obtain such a certificate varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Each health insurer and HMO must file periodic financial and operating reports with the states in which it does business. In addition, health insurers and HMOs are subject to state examination and periodic license renewal. The health benefits business also may be adversely impacted by court and regulatory decisions that expand the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations. It is uncertain whether we can recoup, through higher premiums or other measures, the increased costs of mandated benefits or other increased costs caused by potential legislation, regulation or court rulings. Federal laws and regulations concerning health care and health insurance may be subject to significant change. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. 21 Table of Contents Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act The PPACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, will create significant changes for health insurance markets for the next several years. Specifically, many of the near-term changes are effective for certain groups and individuals on their first renewal on or after September 23, 2010, including a prohibition on lifetime limits, certain annual limits, member cost-sharing on specified preventive benefits, and pre-existing condition exclusions for children. Certain requirements for insurers are also effective in 2011, including the minimum medical loss ratio provision that requires insurers to pay rebates to customers when insurers do not meet or exceed the specified medical loss ratio thresholds, and changes to Medicare Advantage payments. Most of the provisions of PPACA with more significant effects on the health insurance marketplace go into effect on January 1, 2014, including a requirement that insurers guarantee the issuance of coverage to all individuals regardless of health status, strict rules on how health insurance is rated, the assessment of new taxes and fees, the creation of new insurance exchanges for individuals and small groups, and substantial expansions in eligibility for Medicaid. Some provisions of the health care reform legislation became effective in 2010, including those that bar health insurance companies from placing lifetime limits on insurance coverage, those related to the increased restrictions on rescinding coverage and those that extend coverage of dependents to the age of 26. The establishment of minimum medical loss ratios, which could have a significant impact on our operations, became effective for certain of our businesses beginning in January, 2011. A new requirement for reviewing certain rate filings that fall above specified thresholds is also scheduled to go into effect in 2011. Lastly, other significant changes, including the annual fees on health insurance companies, the excise tax on high premium insurance policies, the guaranteed coverage requirements and the requirement that individuals obtain coverage, do not become effective until 2014 or later. Many of the details of the new law require additional guidance and specificity to be provided by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Treasury. In certain cases, these regulatory agencies were directed to accept recommendations from external groups, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC. While proposed regulations on some provisions have been released for review and comment, all of which we are carefully evaluating, it is too early to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall business. Some of the more significant provisions of PPACA are described below: • While the NAIC released its proposed recommendations governing medical loss ratios, and HHS largely adopted the NAIC’s recommendations in its Interim Final Rule, significant changes could still occur to the medical loss ratio requirements through regulatory guidance and publication of the final regulation. • PPACA also requires states to establish health insurance exchanges for qualified individuals and small employers effective January 1, 2014. If a state fails to establish a health insurance exchange, the federal government will establish a health insurance exchange in that state. While the states are expected to have some flexibility over the design and implementation of these health insurance exchanges, HHS is expected to release two sets of regulations outlining more detailed requirements for exchanges, one in the spring of 2011 and another in the fall of 2011. In addition, California passed legislation establishing an insurance exchange within that state to comply with the related provisions that will likely become effective in 2014. As California is the first state to provide a structure for such state-based insurance exchanges pursuant to the legislation, other states may adopt a similar format for their exchanges subject to the regulations that will be provided by HHS in 2011. • HHS has proposed regulations that require certain rate filings above specified thresholds to be reviewed, effective in July, 2011. The regulation provides for state departments of insurance to conduct the reviews, except for cases where a state does not have an “effective” rate review program, in which case HHS will conduct the reviews. • Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates will decline due to a new payment formula promulgated by PPACA that is expected to significantly reduce reimbursements in the future. We also expect final 22 Table of Contents regulations for other significant provisions of PPACA related to Medicare, including quality bonus payments and rebates, authority for CMS to deny bids and first-dollar coverage requirements for preventive care. • PPACA also includes three “risk adjuster” programs that will introduce new requirements beginning in 2014 depending on the risk mix of individuals enrolled in the individual and small group markets. Among other things, these programs require insurers enrolling lower-risk individuals to pay into funds to compensate insurers enrolling higher-risk individuals. Details of these programs in the form of proposed regulations may emerge in 2011. • Recent federal court decisions questioning the constitutionality of all or portions of the new federal health care reform legislation add further uncertainty to our ability to understand the ultimate impacts of the legislation on our overall business. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act During 2010, the U.S. Congress passed and the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a far-reaching overhaul of the framework for the U.S. financial services industry. Even though we are primarily a health benefits company, our business may be impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act. Many of its provisions require the adoption of rules for implementation, including those that govern which non-bank financial companies may become subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Dodd-Frank Act identifies non-bank financial companies that may become subject to Federal Reserve oversight as those that could pose a threat to financial stability either due to the potential of material financial distress at the company or due to the company’s ongoing activities. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, or the Council, recently published proposed criteria and a framework for determining which non-bank financial companies meet these definitions. These criteria and framework are subject to a public comment period and will then result in final rules that may or may not be different from the proposals. The Council announced that it will begin evaluating companies against the final rules shortly thereafter. We believe that we might be considered a non-bank financial company and it is possible that we could become subject to additional oversight by the Federal Reserve under the final rules. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act creates a Federal Insurance Office, with limited powers that include information-gathering and subpoena authority. Although the Federal Insurance Office does not have authority over health insurance, it may have authority over other parts of our business, such as life insurance. HIPAA and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes obligations for issuers of health insurance coverage and health benefit plan sponsors. This law requires guaranteed renewability of health care coverage for most group health plans and certain individuals. Also, the law limits exclusions based on preexisting medical conditions. The Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA imposed a number of requirements on covered entities (including insurers, HMOs, group health plans, providers and clearinghouses). These requirements include uniform standards of common electronic health care transactions; privacy and security regulations; and unique identifier rules for employers, health plans and providers. Additional federal privacy and security requirements, including breach notification, improved enforcement and additional limitations on use and disclosure of protected health information were passed through the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH, provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and corresponding implementing regulations. Additional implementing regulations relating to HITECH are expected in 2011. The federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally places restrictions on the disclosure of non-public information to non-affiliated third parties, and requires financial institutions, including insurers, to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal information is used, including an opportunity to 23 Table of Contents “opt out” of certain disclosures. State departments of insurance and certain federal agencies adopted implementing regulations as required by federal law. A number of states have adopted data security laws and/or regulations, regulating data security and/or requiring security breach notification, which may apply to us in certain circumstances. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 The provision of services to certain employee welfare benefit plans is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, a complex set of laws and regulations subject to interpretation and enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor. ERISA regulates certain aspects of the relationships between us, the employers who maintain employee welfare benefit plans subject to ERISA and participants in such plans. Some of our administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under ERISA. In addition, certain states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims administration services for benefit plans. We provide a variety of products and services to employee welfare benefit plans that are covered by ERISA. Plans subject to ERISA can also be subject to state laws and the question of whether and to what extent ERISA preempts a state law has been, and will continue to be, interpreted by many courts. HMO and Insurance Holding Company Laws We are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and HMO subsidiaries are domiciled. These acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or HMO and its affiliates. These holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and HMOs within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states’ insurance departments certain reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. In addition, various notice and reporting requirements generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and HMOs and their affiliates within an insurance holding company system, depending on the size and nature of the transactions. Some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or, in certain circumstances, prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies, HMOs, their parent holding companies and affiliates. Among other provisions, state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. Additionally, the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company, which controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company. “Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person. Guaranty Fund Assessments Under insolvency or guaranty association laws in most states, insurance companies can be assessed for amounts paid by guaranty funds for policyholder losses incurred when an insurance company becomes insolvent. Most state insolvency or guaranty association laws currently provide for assessments based upon the amount of premiums received on insurance underwritten within such state (with a minimum amount payable even if no premium is received). Under many of these guaranty association laws, assessments against insurance companies that issue policies of accident or sickness insurance are made retrospectively. 24 Table of Contents While the amount and timing of any future assessments cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that future guaranty association assessments for insurer insolvencies will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources with the exception of potential exposure related to the Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary American Network Insurance Company insolvency as discussed under Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” included in this Form 10-K. Risk-Based Capital Requirements The states of domicile of our regulated subsidiaries have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies and HMOs based on the RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to assess the capital adequacy of life and health insurers and HMOs, taking into account the risk characteristics of a company’s investments and products. The RBC Model Act sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual company’s business. In general, under these laws, an insurance company or HMO must submit a report of its RBC level to the insurance department or insurance commissioner of its state of domicile for each calendar year. The law requires increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as a company’s RBC declines. The RBC Model Act provides for four different levels of regulatory attention depending on the ratio of a company’s total adjusted capital (defined as the total of its statutory capital, surplus and asset valuation reserve) to its risk-based capital. The level of regulatory oversight ranges from requiring the company to inform and obtain approval from the domiciling insurance commissioner of a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its RBC, to mandatory regulatory intervention requiring a company to be placed under regulatory control in a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding. As of December 31, 2010, the RBC levels of our insurance and HMO subsidiaries exceeded all RBC thresholds. Employees At December 31, 2010, we had approximately 37,500 employees. As of December 31, 2010, a small portion of employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements: 157 employees in the Sacramento, California area with the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 29; 49 employees in the greater Detroit, Michigan area with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, Local No. 614; 12 employees in the New York city metropolitan area with the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 153; and 24 employees in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 9. Our employees are an important asset, and we seek to develop them to their full potential. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all our potential risks or uncertainties. Because of these and other factors, past performance should not be considered an indication of future performance. Recently enacted federal health care reform legislation, as well as expected additional changes in federal or state regulations could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operation. During the first quarter of 2010, the U.S. Congress passed and the President signed into law PPACA as well as HCERA, which represent significant changes to the current U.S. health care system. The legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage over time by increasing the eligibility 25 Table of Contents thresholds for most state Medicaid programs and providing certain other individuals and small businesses with tax credits to subsidize a portion of the cost of health insurance coverage. The legislation includes a requirement that most individuals obtain health insurance coverage beginning in 2014 and also a requirement that certain large employers offer coverage to their employees or pay a financial penalty. In addition, the new laws include certain new taxes and fees, including an excise tax on high premium insurance policies, limitations on the amount of compensation that is tax deductible and new fees on companies in our industry, some of which will not be deductible for income tax purposes. The legislation also imposes new regulations on the health insurance sector, including, but not limited to, guaranteed coverage requirements, prohibitions on some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to our members, increased restrictions on rescinding coverage, establishment of minimum medical loss ratio requirements, a requirement to cover preventive services on a first dollar basis, the establishment of state insurance exchanges and essential benefit packages and greater limitations on how we price certain of our products. The legislation also reduces the reimbursement levels for health plans participating in the Medicare Advantage program over time. These and other provisions of the new law are likely to have significant effects on our future operations, which, in turn, could impact the value of our business model and results of operations, including potential impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies may further restrict our ability to obtain new product approvals, implement changes in premium rates or impose additional restrictions, under new or existing laws that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the regulation of our business by state and federal regulators may adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance, managed health care and HMO subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the insurance, managed health care or HMO regulatory authorities of each state in which they are licensed or authorized to do business, as well as to regulation by federal and local agencies. We cannot assure that future regulatory action by state insurance or HMO authorities or federal regulatory authorities will not have a material adverse effect on the profitability or marketability of our health benefits or managed care products or on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because of our participation in government-sponsored programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, changes in government regulations or policy with respect to, among other things, reimbursement levels, eligibility requirements and additional governmental participation could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot ensure that application of the federal and/or state tax regulatory regime that currently applies to us will not, or future tax regulation by either federal and/or state governmental authorities concerning us could not, have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. State legislatures will continue to focus on health care delivery and financing issues. A number of states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, New York, Vermont and Pennsylvania, are contemplating significant reform of their health insurance markets. These proposals may include provisions affecting both public programs and privately-financed health insurance arrangements. As these proposals are still being debated in the various legislatures, we cannot assure you that, if enacted into law, these proposals would not have a negative impact on our business, operations or financial condition. In addition, several states are considering legislative proposals to require prior regulatory approval of premium rate increases or establish minimum benefit expense ratio thresholds. If enacted, these state proposals could have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. From time to time, Congress has considered various forms of managed care reform legislation which, if adopted, could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under ERISA. Additionally, there have been legislative attempts to limit ERISA’s preemptive effect on state laws and litigants’ ability to seek damages 26 Table of Contents beyond the benefits offered under their plans. If adopted, such limitations could increase our liability exposure, could permit greater state regulation of our operations, and could expand the scope of damages, including punitive damages litigants could be awarded. While we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become effective or, if enacted, what their terms will be, their enactment could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business. Further, as we continue to implement our e-business initiatives, uncertainty surrounding the regulatory authority and requirements in this area may make it difficult to ensure compliance. Our inability to contain health care costs, implement increases in premium rates on a timely basis, maintain adequate reserves for policy benefits, maintain our current provider agreements or avoid a downgrade in our ratings may adversely affect our business and profitability. Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting health care costs and on our ability to manage future health care costs through underwriting criteria, medical management, product design and negotiation of favorable provider contracts. Government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement have also caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care costs. Changes in health care practices, demographic characteristics, inflation, new technologies, the cost of prescription drugs, clusters of high cost cases, changes in the regulatory environment and numerous other factors affecting the cost of health care may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care costs, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our results of operations. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be adversely affected. In addition to the challenge of managing health care costs, we face pressure to contain premium rates. Our customer contracts may be subject to renegotiation as customers seek to contain their costs. Alternatively, our customers may move to a competitor to obtain more favorable premiums. Further, federal and state regulatory agencies may restrict our ability to implement changes in premium rates. For example, PPACA includes an annual rate review requirement to prohibit unreasonable rate increases. We are awaiting publication of guidance from federal agencies to better understand the expected compliance requirements. Fiscal concerns regarding the continued viability of programs such as Medicare and Medicaid may cause decreasing reimbursement rates or a lack of sufficient increase in reimbursement rates for government-sponsored programs in which we participate. A limitation on our ability to increase or maintain our premium or reimbursement levels or a significant loss of membership resulting from our need to increase or maintain premium or reimbursement levels could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. The reserves that we establish for health insurance policy benefits and other contractual rights and benefits are based upon assumptions concerning a number of factors, including trends in health care costs, expenses, general economic conditions and other factors. To the extent the actual claims experience is less favorable than estimated based on our underlying assumptions, our incurred losses would increase and future earnings could be adversely affected. In addition, our profitability is dependent upon our ability to contract on favorable terms with hospitals, physicians and other health care providers. The failure to maintain or to secure new cost-effective health care provider contracts may result in a loss in membership or higher medical costs. In addition, our inability to contract with providers, or the inability of providers to provide adequate care, could adversely affect our business. Claims-paying ability and financial strength ratings by recognized rating organizations are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and health benefits companies. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future. We believe our strong ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to 27 Table of Contents customers, since ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. If our ratings are downgraded or placed under review, with possible negative implications, such actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders and creditors, and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock. A reduction in the enrollment in our health benefits programs could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability. A reduction in the number of enrollees in our health benefits programs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could contribute to a reduction in enrollment include: reductions in workforce by existing customers; general economic downturn that results in business failures; employers no longer offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or electing to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis; state and federal regulatory changes; failure to obtain new customers or retain existing customers; premium increases and benefit changes; our exit from a specific market; negative publicity and news coverage; and failure to attain or maintain nationally recognized accreditations. There are various risks associated with participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs, and contracting with CMS to provide Medicare Part C and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug benefits. We offer Medicare approved prescription drug plans (Medicare Part D) and Medicare Advantage plans (Medicare Part C) to Medicare eligible individuals nationwide. In addition, we provide various administrative services for other entities offering medical and/or prescription drug plans to their Medicare eligible employees and retirees through our affiliated companies. We also participate in Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicaid programs and receive revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs to provide benefits under these programs. Revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government and/or applicable state governments. Funding for these programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities. An unexpected reduction or inadequate government funding for these programs may adversely affect our revenues and financial results. Risks associated with the Medicare Advantage and Medicare prescription drug plans include potential uncollectability of receivables resulting from processing and/or verifying enrollment, inadequacy of underwriting assumptions, inability to receive and process correct information (including inability due to systems issues by the federal government, the applicable state government or us), uncollectability of premiums from members, increased medical or pharmaceutical costs, and the underlying seasonality of this business. While we believe we have adequately reviewed our assumptions and estimates regarding these complex and wide-ranging programs under Medicare Part C and D, including those related to collectability of receivables and establishment of liabilities, the actual results may be materially different than our assumptions and estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The laws and regulations governing participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex, subject to interpretation and can expose us to penalties for non-compliance. If we fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal fines, civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in these programs, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, legislative or regulatory changes to these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. During 2008, we worked with CMS to resolve issues identified as a result of our internal compliance audits and findings from a 2008 CMS audit. Our work included detailed action plans to remediate such findings. In addition, we engaged an independent third party to provide CMS with on-going assessments regarding our compliance, including verification of systems, processes and procedures. 28 Table of Contents On January 12, 2009, CMS notified us that we were suspended from marketing to and enrolling new members in our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D health benefit products until remediation efforts had been fully implemented and confirmed. On September 9, 2009, CMS notified us that the sanctions had been lifted due to our remediation efforts. We began marketing our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D products on October 1, 2009 and began enrolling new members on November 15, 2009 for the 2010 contract year. We were not allowed to participate in the auto-enrollment or reassignment of Medicare Part D LIS beneficiaries beginning October 1, 2008. We worked with CMS to demonstrate that our agreed corrective action plans related to the Medicare Part D and LIS programs had been completed. CMS notified us on June 15, 2010 that we were again eligible to enroll LIS beneficiaries beginning July 1, 2010 with an effective date of September 1, 2010. Adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs. The securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility, although current market conditions are more stable. In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers. We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, make payments on our indebtedness and pay capital expenditures. The principal sources of our cash receipts are premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. Our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to our industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If one or a combination of these factors were to occur, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms. One of our sources of liquidity is our $2.5 billion commercial paper program, with $0.3 billion and $0.5 billion outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we intend to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our $2.0 billion senior credit facility to redeem our commercial paper when it matures. While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we believe the lenders participating in our senior credit facility will be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. The value of our investments is influenced by varying economic and market conditions, and a decrease in value may result in a loss charged to income. The market values of our investments vary from time to time depending on economic and market conditions. For various reasons, we may sell certain of our investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of the investments. In addition, in periods of declining interest rates, bond calls and mortgage loan prepayments generally increase, resulting in the reinvestment of these funds at the then lower market rates. In periods of rising interest rates, the market values of our fixed maturity securities will generally decrease, which could result in material unrealized or realized losses on investments in future periods. We cannot assure you that our investment portfolios will produce positive returns in future periods. Current and long-term available-for-sale investment securities were $17.6 billion at December 31, 2010 and represented 35% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2010. In accordance with FASB guidance for debt and equity investments, we classify fixed maturity and equity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” or “trading” and report those securities at fair value. 29 Table of Contents In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we review our investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis analyzing both quantitative and qualitative factors. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. Changes in the economic environment, including periods of increased volatility of the securities markets can increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. Given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and material other-than-temporary impairments may be charged to income in future periods, resulting in realized losses. Regional concentrations of our business may subject us to economic downturns in those regions. The national economy has continued to experience a downturn, with the potential for continued higher unemployment. Most of our revenues are generated in the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. Due to this concentration of business in these states, we are exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of a more severe economic downturn in these states. If economic conditions continue to deteriorate, we may experience a reduction in existing and new business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. The health benefits industry is subject to negative publicity, which can adversely affect our business and profitability. The health benefits industry is subject to negative publicity. Negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by: adversely affecting our ability to market our products and services; requiring us to change our products and services; or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate. In addition, as long as we use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in marketing our health benefits products and services, any negative publicity concerning the BCBSA or other BCBSA licensees may adversely affect us and the sale of our health benefits products and services. Any such negative publicity could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. We face competition in many of our markets and customers and brokers have flexibility in moving between competitors. As a health benefits company, we operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is currently subject to significant changes from legislative reform, business consolidations, new strategic alliances, aggressive marketing practices by other health benefits organizations and market pressures brought about by an informed and organized customer base, particularly among large employers. This environment has produced and will likely continue to produce significant pressures on the profitability of health benefits companies. We are currently dependent on the non-exclusive services of independent agents and brokers in the marketing of our health care products, particularly with respect to individuals, seniors and small employer group members. We face intense competition for the services and allegiance of these independent agents and brokers, 30 Table of Contents who may also market the products of our competitors. We cannot ensure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. We face intense competition to attract and retain employees. Further, managing Chief Executive Officer and key executive succession and retention is critical to our success. We are dependent on retaining existing employees and attracting additional qualified employees to meet current and future needs and achieving productivity gains from our investments in technology. We face intense competition for qualified employees, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that such competition among potential employers will not result in increasing salaries. An inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for succession of our Chief Executive Officer, and senior management and retention of key executives. While we have succession plans in place and we have employment arrangements with certain key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us. A change in our health care product mix may impact our profitability. Our health care products that involve greater potential risk generally tend to be more profitable than administrative services products and those health care products where the employer groups assume the underwriting risks. Individuals and small employer groups are more likely to purchase our higher-risk health care products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditures. Typically, government-sponsored programs also involve our higher-risk health care products. A shift of enrollees from more profitable products to less profitable products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As a holding company, we are dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries. These dividends are necessary to pay our outstanding indebtedness. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to state regulations, including restrictions on the payment of dividends, maintenance of minimum levels of capital and restrictions on investment portfolios. We are a holding company whose assets include all of the outstanding shares of common stock of our subsidiaries including our intermediate holding companies and regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities. As a holding company, we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries. Furthermore, our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us, and creditors of our subsidiaries will have a superior claim to certain of our subsidiaries’ assets. Among other restrictions, state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. In some states we have made special undertakings that may limit the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, our subsidiaries’ ability to make any payments to us will also depend on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, business and tax considerations and other legal restrictions. Our ability to repurchase shares or pay dividends in the future to our shareholders and meet our obligations, including paying operating expenses and debt service on our outstanding and future indebtedness, will depend upon the receipt of dividends from our subsidiaries. An inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends in the future in an amount sufficient for us to meet our financial obligations may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Most of our regulated subsidiaries are subject to RBC standards, imposed by their states of domicile. These laws are based on the RBC Model Act adopted by the NAIC and require our regulated subsidiaries to report their results of risk-based capital calculations to the departments of insurance and the NAIC. Failure to maintain the 31 Table of Contents minimum RBC standards could subject our regulated subsidiaries to corrective action, including state supervision or liquidation. Our regulated subsidiaries are currently in compliance with the risk-based capital or other similar requirements imposed by their respective states of domicile. As discussed in more detail below, we are a party to license agreements with the BCBSA which contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations, including minimum capital and liquidity requirements, which could restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain riskier investment categories, such as below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and equity investments, which could generate higher returns on our investments. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations might cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and risk-based capital, and, in some instances, require the sale of those investments. We have substantial indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Such indebtedness could also adversely affect our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities. As of December 31, 2010, we had indebtedness outstanding of approximately $8.9 billion and had available borrowing capacity of approximately $2.0 billion under our revolving credit facility, which expires on September 30, 2013. Our debt service obligations require us to use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal on debt instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to seek extraordinary dividends from our subsidiaries, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. However, these measures might be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service obligations. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. Our breach or failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements. If we default under our credit agreements, the lenders could cease to make further extensions of credit or cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under our credit agreements to become immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If the indebtedness under our notes or our credit agreements is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due. Indebtedness could also limit our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities, and may affect our ability to maintain an investment grade rating for our indebtedness. We face risks related to litigation. We are, or may in the future, be a party to a variety of legal actions that affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits and administrative charges before government agencies, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims and intellectual property-related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management and offering of our products and services. These could include claims relating to the denial of health care benefits; the rescission of health insurance policies; development or application of medical policy; medical malpractice actions; allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities; provider disputes over compensation; provider tiering programs; termination of provider contracts; self-funded business; disputes over co-payment calculations; reimbursement of out-of-network claims; the failure to disclose certain business or corporate governance practices; and customer audits and contract performance, including government contracts. In addition, we are also involved in, or may in the future be party to, pending or threatened litigation of the character incidental to the business transacted, arising out of our operations or our 2001 demutualization, including, but not limited to, breaches of security and violations of privacy requirements, shareholder actions, 32 Table of Contents compliance with federal and state laws and regulations, or sales and acquisitions of businesses or assets, and are from time to time involved as a party in various governmental investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings. These investigations, audits and reviews include routine and special investigations by various state insurance departments, state attorneys general and the U.S. Attorney General. Such investigations could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions. We believe that any liability that may result from any one of these actions, or in the aggregate, is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations or financial position. Recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. In some cases, substantial non-economic, treble or punitive damages may be sought. We currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities. Other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. Any adverse judgment against us resulting in such damage awards could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. For additional information concerning legal actions affecting us, see Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in this Form 10-K. We are a party to license agreements with the BCBSA that entitle us to the exclusive and in certain areas non-exclusive use of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in our geographic territories. The termination of these license agreements or changes in the terms and conditions of these license agreements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks as identifiers for our products and services under licenses from the BCBSA. Our license agreements with the BCBSA contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks, including: minimum capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the BCBSA; enrollment and customer service performance requirements; participation in programs that provide portability of membership between plans; disclosures to the BCBSA relating to enrollment and financial conditions; disclosures as to the structure of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield system in contracts with third parties and in public statements; plan governance requirements; a requirement that at least 80% (or, in the case of Blue Cross of California, substantially all) of a licensee’s annual combined local net revenue, as defined by the BCBSA, attributable to health benefit plans within its service areas must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks; a requirement that at least 66 2/3% of a licensee’s annual combined national net revenue, as defined by the BCBSA, attributable to health benefit plans must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks; a requirement that neither a plan nor any of its licensed affiliates may permit an entity other than a plan or a licensed affiliate to obtain control of the plan or the licensed affiliate or to acquire a substantial portion of its assets related to licensable services; a requirement that we divide our Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms; a requirement that we guarantee certain contractual and financial obligations of our licensed affiliates; and a requirement that we indemnify the BCBSA against any claims asserted against it resulting from the contractual and financial obligations of any subsidiary that serves as a fiscal intermediary providing administrative services for Medicare Parts A and B. Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements could result in a termination of the license agreements. The standards under the license agreements may be modified in certain instances by the BCBSA. For example, from time to time there have been proposals considered by the BCBSA to modify the terms of the license agreements to restrict various potential business activities of licensees. These proposals have included, among other things, a limitation on the ability of a licensee to make its provider networks available to insurance carriers or other entities not holding a Blue Cross or Blue Shield license. To the extent that such amendments to the license agreements are adopted in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our future expansion plans or results of operations. 33 Table of Contents Upon the occurrence of an event causing termination of the license agreements, we would no longer have the right to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in one or more of our service areas. Furthermore, the BCBSA would be free to issue a license to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in these service areas to another entity. Events that could cause the termination of a license agreement with the BCBSA include failure to comply with minimum capital requirements imposed by the BCBSA, a change of control or violation of the BCBSA ownership limitations on our capital stock, impending financial insolvency and the appointment of a trustee or receiver or the commencement of any action against a licensee seeking its dissolution. We believe that the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks are valuable identifiers of our products and services in the marketplace. Accordingly, termination of the license agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Upon termination of a license agreement, the BCBSA would impose a “Re-establishment Fee” upon us, which would allow the BCBSA to “re-establish” a Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield presence in the vacated service area. Through December 31, 2010 the fee was set at $98.33 per licensed enrollee. As of December 31, 2010 we reported 28.4 million Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield enrollees. If the Re-establishment Fee was applied to our total Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield enrollees, we would be assessed approximately $2.8 billion by the BCBSA. Large-scale medical emergencies may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Large-scale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread illness and death. For example, federal and state law enforcement officials have issued warnings about potential terrorist activity involving biological and other weapons. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes and the potential for a wide-spread pandemic of influenza coupled with the lack of availability of appropriate preventative medicines can have a significant impact on the health of the population of wide-spread areas. If the United States were to experience widespread bioterrorism or other attacks, large-scale natural disasters in our concentrated coverage areas or a large-scale pandemic or epidemic, our covered medical expenses could rise and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations or, in the event of extreme circumstances, our viability could be threatened. We have built a significant portion of our current business through mergers and acquisitions and we expect to pursue acquisitions in the future. The following are some of the risks associated with acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations: • some of the acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow; • we may establish goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of a future acquisition; • we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or which were under-estimated; • we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully, or as quickly as expected, and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; • acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures; • we may finance future acquisitions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price, which could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders; • we may also incur additional debt related to future acquisitions; and • we would be competing with other firms, some of which may have greater financial and other resources, to acquire attractive companies. 34 Table of Contents The value of our intangible assets may become impaired. Due largely to our past mergers and acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $21.3 billion as of December 31, 2010, representing approximately 42% of our total assets and 89% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2010. If we make additional acquisitions it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to income may be necessary. This impairment testing requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, including goodwill and other intangibles (with indefinite lives). In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately. Estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in future impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders’ equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. In addition, the estimated value of our reporting units may be impacted as a result of business decisions we make associated with the implementation of the various health care reform regulations. Such decisions, which could unfavorably affect our ability to support the carrying value of certain goodwill and other intangible assets, could result in impairment charges in future periods. We may not be able to realize the value of our deferred tax assets. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we separately recognize deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. At each financial reporting date, we evaluate our deferred tax assets to determine the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences. Our evaluation includes a review of the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset; the amount of taxes paid on both capital gains and ordinary income in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim; the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, the likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and any other significant issues that might impact the realization of the deferred tax asset. If it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance. Significant judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance. Any future increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense and a decrease in shareholders’ equity, which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the increase occurs. A material decrease in shareholders’ equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. 35 Table of Contents An unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and profitability. As part of our normal operations, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential member information. We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information, including HIPAA and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Despite the security measures we have in place to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information, whether by us or by one of our vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations. The failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information systems could adversely affect our business. Our business depends significantly on effective information systems, and we have many different information systems for our various businesses. As a result of our merger and acquisition activities, we have acquired additional systems. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. In addition, we may from time to time obtain significant portions of our systems-related or other services or facilities from independent third parties, which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately. Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the information we rely upon to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could have a decrease in membership, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing and reserves, have disputes with customers and providers, have regulatory problems, sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. In addition, as we convert or migrate members to our more efficient and effective systems, the risk of disruption in our customer service is increased during the migration or conversion process and such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. We are working towards becoming a premier e-business organization by modernizing interactions with customers, brokers, agents, providers, employees and other stakeholders through web-enabling technology and redesigning internal operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to fully realize our e-business vision. The failure to maintain successful e-business capabilities could result in competitive and cost disadvantages to us as compared to our competitors. We are dependent on the success of our relationship with a large vendor for a significant portion of our information system resources and certain other vendors for various other services. We have an agreement with International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, pursuant to which we outsourced a significant portion of our data center operations and certain core applications development. We are dependent upon IBM for these support functions. The IBM agreement includes service level agreements, or SLAs, related to issues such as performance and job disruption, with significant financial penalties if these SLAs are not met, as well as termination assistance provisions obligating IBM to provide services during periods following transitions or terminations. If our relationship with IBM is significantly disrupted for any reason, we may not be able to find an alternative partner in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. As a result, we 36 Table of Contents may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and, in turn, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. We may not be adequately indemnified against all possible losses through the terms and conditions of the IBM agreement. In addition, some of our termination rights are contingent upon payment of a fee, which may be significant. We have also entered into a ten-year contract for Express Scripts to provide PBM services to our members in connection with the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts in December 2009. Express Scripts is now the exclusive provider of certain specified pharmacy benefits management services, such as pharmacy network management, home delivery, pharmacy customer service, claims processing, rebate management, drug utilization and specialty pharmaceutical management services. Accordingly, the agreement contains certain financial and operational requirements obligating both Express Scripts and us. The failure of either party to meet the respective agreements could potentially serve as a basis for early termination of the contract. If this relationship was terminated for any reason, we may not be able to find alternative partners in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. As a result, we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations. In addition, our failure to meet certain minimum script volume requirements may result in financial penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We have also entered into agreements with a large vendor pursuant to which we have outsourced certain back-office functions. If this vendor relationship were terminated for any reason, we may not be able to find an alternative partner in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. In addition, if for any reason there is a business continuity interruption resulting from loss of access to or availability of data, the physical location, technological resources and/or adequate human assets, we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers and, in turn, our business, cash flow, financial conditions and results of operations may be unfavorably impacted. Indiana law, and other applicable laws, and our articles of incorporation and bylaws, may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider in their best interest. Indiana law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent our shareholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. We are regulated as an insurance holding company and subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, as well as similar provisions included in the health statutes and regulations of certain states where these subsidiaries are regulated as managed care companies or HMOs. The insurance holding company acts and regulations and these similar health provisions restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes and regulations, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of a domestic insurance company or HMO, or an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company, insurance company or HMO. “Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person. Further, the Indiana corporation law contains business combination provisions that, in general, prohibit for five years any business combination with a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our common stock 37 Table of Contents unless the holder’s acquisition of the stock was approved in advance by our Board of Directors. The Indiana corporation law also contains control share acquisition provisions that limit the ability of certain shareholders to vote their shares unless their control share acquisition is approved in advance. Effective December 9, 2010, we amended our bylaws to opt out of these control share acquisition provisions. Our articles of incorporation restrict the beneficial ownership of our capital stock in excess of specific ownership limits. The ownership limits restrict beneficial ownership of our voting capital stock to less than 10% for institutional investors and less than 5% for non-institutional investors, both as defined in our articles of incorporation. Additionally, no person may beneficially own shares of our common stock representing a 20% or more ownership interest in us. These restrictions are intended to ensure our compliance with the terms of our licenses with the BCBSA. Our articles of incorporation prohibit ownership of our capital stock beyond these ownership limits without prior approval of a majority of our continuing directors (as defined in our articles of incorporation). In addition, as discussed above in the risk factor describing our license agreements with the BCBSA, such license agreements are subject to termination upon a change of control and re-establishment fees would be imposed upon termination of the license agreements. Certain other provisions included in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may also have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider in their best interests. In particular, our articles of incorporation and bylaws: divide our Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms (which is also required by our license agreement with the BCBSA); permit our Board of Directors to determine the terms of and issue one or more series of preferred stock without further action by shareholders; restrict the maximum number of directors; limit the ability of shareholders to remove directors; impose restrictions on shareholders’ ability to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors; prohibit shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders; impose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at meetings of shareholders; impose restrictions on shareholders’ ability to amend our articles of incorporation; and prohibit shareholders from amending our bylaws. We also face other risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, which include: • any requirement to restate financial results in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles; • a significant failure of our internal control over financial reporting; • our inability to convert to international financial reporting standards, if required; • failure of our prevention and control systems related to employee compliance with internal polices, including data security; • provider fraud that is not prevented or detected and impacts our medical costs or those of self-insured customers; • failure to protect our proprietary information; and • failure of our corporate governance policies or procedures.

In various California state courts, we are defending a number of individual lawsuits, including one filed by the Los Angeles City Attorney, and one purported class action alleging the wrongful rescission of individual insurance policies. The suits name WellPoint as well as Blue Cross of California, or BCC, and BC Life & Health Insurance Company, or BCL&H (which name changed to Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Company in July 2007), both WellPoint subsidiaries. The lawsuits generally allege breach of contract, bad faith and unfair business practices in a purported practice of rescinding new individual members following the submission of large claims. The parties agreed to mediate most of these lawsuits and the mediation resulted in the resolution of some of these lawsuits. Final approval of the class action settlement was granted on July 13, 2010, and no appeals were filed. Payments pursuant to the terms of the settlement are expected to occur in the first or second quarter of 2011 and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of 39 Table of Contents operations. The Los Angeles City Attorney filed an amended complaint in October 2010, adding claims of misrepresentation arising from several public statements made by the Company during the year. A demurrer to the amended complaint has been filed. We are currently defending several putative class actions filed as a result of the 2001 Anthem Insurance Companies, Inc., or AICI, demutualization. The suits name AICI as well as Anthem, Inc., or Anthem, n/k/a WellPoint, Inc. The suits are captioned as Ronald Gold, et al. v. Anthem, Inc. et al.; Mary E. Ormond, et al. v. Anthem, Inc,. et al.; Ronald E. Mell, Sr., et al. v. Anthem, Inc., et al; and Jeffrey D. Jorling, et al., v. Anthem, Inc. (n/k/a WellPoint, Inc.) et al. AICI’s 2001 Plan of Conversion, or the Plan, provided for the conversion of AICI from a mutual insurance company into a stock insurance company pursuant to Indiana law. Under the Plan, AICI distributed the fair value of the company at the time of conversion to its Eligible Statutory Members, or ESMs, in the form of cash or Anthem common stock in exchange for their membership interests in the mutual company. The lawsuits generally allege that AICI distributed value to the wrong ESMs or distributed insufficient value to the ESMs. In Gold, cross motions for summary judgment were granted in part and denied in part with regard to the issue of sovereign immunity asserted by co-defendant, the State of Connecticut (the “State”). The State appealed this denial to the Connecticut Supreme Court. We filed a cross-appeal. Oral argument was held in November 2008. On May 11, 2010, the Court reversed the judgment of the trial court denying the State’s motion to dismiss the plaintiff’s claims under sovereign immunity. Our cross-appeal was dismissed by the Court. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. In the Ormond suit, our Motion to Dismiss was granted in part and denied in part on March 31, 2008. The Court dismissed the claims for violation of federal and state securities laws, for violation of the Indiana Demutualization Law and for unjust enrichment. On September 29, 2009, a class was certified. The class consists of all ESMs residing in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky or Connecticut who received cash compensation in connection with the demutualization. The class does not include employers located in Ohio and Connecticut that received compensation under the Plan. On December 23, 2010, a motion for class certification was denied in the Jorling suit. On November 4, 2009 a class was certified in the Mell suit. That class consists of persons who were employees or retirees who were continuously enrolled in the health benefit plan sponsored by the City of Cincinnati between the dates of June 18, 2001 and November 2, 2001. On March 3, 2010, the Court issued an order granting our motion for summary judgment. As a result, the Mell suit has been dismissed. The plaintiffs have filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is pending. We intend to vigorously defend these suits; however, their ultimate outcome cannot be presently determined. We are currently a defendant in a putative class action relating to out-of-network, or OON, reimbursement of dental claims called American Dental Association v. WellPoint Health Networks, Inc. and Blue Cross of California. The lawsuit was filed in March 2002 by the American Dental Association, and three dentists who are suing on behalf of themselves and are seeking to sue on behalf of a nationwide class of all non-participating dental providers who were paid less than their actual charges for dental services provided to WellPoint dental members. The complaint alleges that WellPoint Health Networks Inc., BCC and other WellPoint affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, WellPoint) improperly set usual, customary and reasonable payment for OON dental services based on HIAA/Ingenix data. The plaintiffs claim, among other things, that the HIAA/Ingenix databases fail to account for differences in geography, provider specialty, outlier (high) charges, and complexity of procedure. The complaint further alleges that WellPoint was aware that this data was inappropriate to set usual, customary and reasonable rates. The dentists sue as assignees of their patients’ rights to benefits under WellPoint’s dental plans and assert that WellPoint breached its contractual obligations in violation of ERISA by routinely paying OON dentists less than their actual charges and representing that its OON payments were properly determined usual, customary and reasonable rates. The suit is currently pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. We have refiled a motion for summary judgment, which is pending. We intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit; however, its ultimate outcome cannot be presently determined. We are currently a defendant in eleven putative class actions relating to OON reimbursement. The cases have been made part of a WellPoint-only multi-district litigation called In re WellPoint, Inc. Out-of-Network “UCR” Rates Litigation and are pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of 40 Table of Contents California. The first lawsuit (Darryl and Valerie Samsell v. WellPoint, Inc., WellPoint HealthNetworks, Inc. and Anthem, Inc.) was filed in February 2009 by two former members on behalf of a putative class of members who received OON services for which the defendants paid less than billed charges. The plaintiffs in that case allege that the defendants violated RICO, the Sherman Antitrust Act, ERISA, and federal regulations by relying on databases provided by Ingenix in determining OON reimbursement. The second lawsuit (AMA et al. v. WellPoint, Inc.) was brought in March 2009 by the American Medical Association, or AMA, four state medical associations and two individual physicians on behalf of a putative class of OON physicians. The third lawsuit (Roberts v. UnitedHealth Group, Inc. et al.) was brought in March 2009 by a WellPoint member as a putative class action on behalf of all persons or entities who have paid premiums for out-of-network health insurance coverage. The fourth lawsuit (JBW v. UnitedHealth Group, Inc. et al.) was brought in April 2009 by a WellPoint member as a putative class action on behalf of all persons who have paid premiums for out-of-network health insurance coverage. The fifth lawsuit (O’Brien, et al. v. WellPoint, Inc., et al.) was brought in May 2009 by three WellPoint members as a putative class action on behalf of all persons who received OON services. The sixth lawsuit (Higashi, D.C. d/b/a Mar Vista Institute of Health v. Blue Cross of California d/b/a WellPoint, Inc.) was brought in June 2009 by an OON chiropractor as a putative class action on behalf of all OON chiropractors. The seventh suit (North Peninsula Surgical Center v. WellPoint, Inc., et al.) was brought in June 2009 by an OON surgical center as a putative class action on behalf of all OON surgical centers. The eighth lawsuit (American Podiatric Medical Association, et al. v. WellPoint, Inc.) was brought in June 2009 by the American Podiatric Medical Association, California Chiropractic Association, California Psychological Association and an OON clinical psychologist as a putative class action on behalf of OON podiatrists, chiropractors and psychologists. The ninth lawsuit (Michael Pariser, et al. v. WellPoint, Inc.) was brought in July 2009 by an OON psychologist as a putative class action on behalf of all OON providers who are not medical doctors or doctors of osteopathy. The tenth lawsuit (Harold S. Bernard, Ph.D., et al. v. WellPoint, Inc.) was brought in July 2009 by an OON psychologist as a putative class action on behalf of all non-medical doctor health care providers. The eleventh lawsuit (Ken Unmacht, Psy.D., et al. v. WellPoint, Inc.) was brought in August 2009 by an OON licensed psychotherapist as a putative class action on behalf of all non-medical doctor health care providers. A consolidated complaint was filed for the eleven cases, and then was amended to broaden the allegations in the lawsuit to OON reimbursement methodologies beyond the use of Ingenix. We filed a revised motion to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint, which is pending. At the end of 2009, we filed a motion to enjoin the claims brought by the medical doctors and doctors of osteopathy based on prior litigation releases. The magistrate judge recommended that our motion to enjoin be granted. The plaintiffs filed objections to the recommendation and we responded. The objections are pending. Plaintiffs then filed a petition for declaratory judgment asking the Court to find that those claims are not barred by the prior litigation releases. We have filed a motion to dismiss the petition for declaratory judgment, which is pending. We intend to vigorously defend these suits; however, their ultimate outcomes cannot be presently determined. Other Contingencies From time to time, we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, many of which involve claims for coverage encountered in the ordinary course of business. We, like HMOs and health insurers generally, exclude certain health care and other services from coverage under our HMO, PPO and other plans. We are, in the ordinary course of business, subject to the claims of our enrollees arising out of decisions to restrict or deny reimbursement for uncovered services. The loss of even one such claim, if it results in a significant punitive damage award, could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, the risk of potential liability under punitive damage theories may increase significantly the difficulty of obtaining reasonable settlements of coverage claims. In addition to the lawsuits described above, we are also involved in other pending and threatened litigation of the character incidental to our business, arising out of our operations and our revision of earnings guidance in 2008, and are from time to time involved as a party in various governmental investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings. These investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings include routine and special inquiries by state insurance departments, state attorneys general, the U.S. Attorney General and 41 Table of Contents subcommittees of the U.S. Congress. Such investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties, other sanctions and additional rules, regulations or other restrictions on our business operations. Any liability that may result from any one of these actions, or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. The National Organization of Life & Health Insurance Guaranty Associations, or NOLHGA is a voluntary association consisting of the state life and health insurance guaranty organizations located throughout the U.S. State life and health insurance guaranty organizations, working together with NOLHGA, provide a safety net for their state’s policyholders, ensuring that they continue to receive coverage even if their insurer is declared insolvent. We are aware that the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner, or Insurance Commissioner, has placed Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary American Network Insurance Company, or collectively Penn Treaty, in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency. The Insurance Commissioner has petitioned the state court for liquidation, however, we do not know when a decision will be made, although we believe it is likely the state court will rule within the next twelve months. In the event that Penn Treaty is declared insolvent and placed in liquidation, we and other insurers may be required to pay a portion of their policyholder claims through state guaranty association assessments in future periods. Given the uncertainty around whether Penn Treaty will ultimately be declared insolvent and, if so, the amount of the insolvency, the amount and timing of any associated future guaranty fund assessments and the availability and amount of any potential premium tax and other offsets, we currently cannot estimate our net exposure, if any, to this potential insolvency. We will continue to monitor the situation and may record a liability and expense in future reporting periods, which could be material to our operating results. ITEM 4.

The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Historically our common stock repurchase program has been our primary use of capital, and we have not previously paid any cash dividends on our common stock through December 31, 2010. Further, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, if authorized by the Board of Directors, is significantly dependent upon the receipt of dividends from our subsidiaries, including Anthem Insurance Companies, Inc., Anthem Southeast, Inc., Anthem Holding Corp., WellPoint Holding Corp., WellPoint Acquisition, LLC, WellPoint Insurance Services, Inc., ATH Holding Company, LLC and SellCore, Inc. The payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department of each subsidiary’s domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula. Dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective insurance departments.

Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, included in this Form 10-K. I. Executive Summary We are the largest health benefits company in terms of medical membership in the United States, serving 33.3 million medical members through our affiliated health plans and a total of 69.2 million individuals through all subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or BCBS, licensee for: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (as BCBS in 10 New York City metropolitan and surrounding counties, and as Blue Cross or BCBS in selected upstate counties only), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, or Empire Blue Cross (in our New York service areas). We also serve customers throughout the country as UniCare. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states through our subsidiaries. Operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $57.8 billion, a decrease of $3.0 billion, or 5%, from the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily driven by fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses resulting from the current economic conditions, the conversions of a large municipal account and a large state employer account from fully-insured to self-funded status in April and July 2010, respectively, and certain UniCare members transitioning to Health Care Service Corporation, or HCSC, beginning January 1, 2010. In addition, the sale of our pharmacy benefit management, or PBM, business and the loss of certain 2010 Medicare Part D auto-assigned Low-Income Subsidy, or Part D LIS, membership within our Senior business contributed to the decline in operating revenue. These decreases were partially offset by higher premiums in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses that were necessary to cover expected cost trends. In addition, operating revenue increased in 2010 due to higher Federal Employee Program, or FEP, reimbursements and increased revenue due to membership gains in our Senior Medicare Advantage business. 47 Table of Contents Net income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $2.9 billion, a decrease of $1.9 billion, or 39% from the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in net income was primarily the result of the after-tax gain on sale of our PBM business in 2009 that was not repeated in 2010, lower operating results in our Other and Consumer Segments during 2010 and increased income taxes excluding the impact of the PBM sale, partially offset by higher operating results in our Commercial segment, a decline in other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments, reduced impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, and increased realized gains on investments. Our fully-diluted earnings per share, or EPS, for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $6.94, a decrease of $2.94, or 30% from the year ended December 31, 2009. Our fully-diluted shares for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 415.8 million, a decrease of 64.7 million, or 13% compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in EPS resulted primarily from the decrease in net income, partially offset by the impact of the lower number of shares outstanding in 2010 as compared to 2009. Our results of operations discussed throughout this MD&A are determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. We also calculate adjusted net income, adjusted EPS and operating gain, which are non-GAAP measures, to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results and comparing them period-over-period. Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS exclude realized gains and losses on investments, other-than-temporary losses on investments recognized in income, impairment of other intangible assets and certain other items, if applicable, that we do not consider a part of our core operating results. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, selling, general and administrative expense and cost of drugs. We use these measures as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and for forecasting future operating periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional details on operating gain, see our “Results of Operations” discussion within this MD&A. The table below reconciles net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP to adjusted net income and adjusted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

The 2009 restructuring and other charges continue to be included in the above reconciliation as we did not consider them part of our core operations at that time. See “Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009” included in this MD&A for further discussion of our operating results. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $1.4 billion, and included a $1.2 billion tax payment in March 2010 to the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, related to the gain we realized on our PBM sale on December 1, 2009. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $3.0 billion or 0.6 times net income. The decrease in operating cash flow from 2009 was driven primarily by the $1.2 billion tax payment and increased incentive compensation payments in 2010. We intend to expand through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and capital transactions in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic and product diversity reduce our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. While we have achieved strong growth as a result of strategic mergers and acquisitions, we have also achieved organic growth in our existing markets over time by providing excellent service, offering competitively priced products and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks. II. Overview We manage our operations through three reportable segments: Commercial, Consumer, and Other. Our Commercial and Consumer segments both offer a diversified mix of managed care products, including preferred provider organizations, or PPOs; health maintenance organizations, or HMOs; traditional indemnity benefits and point-of-service plans, or POS plans; and a variety of hybrid benefit plans including consumer-driven health plans, or CDHPs, hospital only and limited benefit products. Our Commercial segment includes Local Group (including UniCare), National Accounts and certain other ancillary business operations (dental, vision, life and disability and workers’ compensation). Business units in the Commercial segment offer fully-insured products and provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers, including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management, disease management, wellness programs and other administrative services. Our Consumer segment includes Senior, State-Sponsored and Individual businesses. Senior business includes services such as Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and Medicare Supplement, while State-Sponsored business includes our managed care alternatives for Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Plan programs. Individual business includes individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. The Other segment includes our Comprehensive Health Solutions business unit, or CHS, that brings together our resources focused on optimizing the quality of health care and cost of care management. CHS included our PBM business until its sale to Express Scripts, Inc., or Express Scripts, on December 1, 2009, and also encompasses provider relations, care and disease management, employee assistance programs, including behavioral health, radiology benefit management and analytics-driven personal health care guidance. Our Other 49 Table of Contents segment also contains results from our Federal Government Solutions, or FGS, business. FGS business is comprised of the FEP and National Government Services, Inc., or NGS, which acts as a Medicare contractor in several regions across the nation. Finally, the Other segment also includes other businesses that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, guidance for disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information, as well as intersegment sales and expense eliminations and corporate expenses not allocated to the other reportable segments. Our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue comes from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. Administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, or where the fee is based on either processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized. Additionally, we earn administrative fee revenues from our Medicare processing business and from other health-related businesses including disease management programs. Other revenue was principally generated from member co-payments and deductibles associated with the mail-order sale of drugs by our PBM business prior to its sale on December 1, 2009. Our benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. While we offer a diversified mix of managed care products, including PPO, HMO, POS and CDHP products, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products. We have seen an increase in COBRA coverage within these product offerings that can further impact our cost of care. COBRA is named for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, which provides unemployed group members with coverage for up to 18 months after losing their job. On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or ARRA, was signed into law. ARRA originally provided for a temporary subsidy of COBRA premiums for individuals that were involuntarily terminated from employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct) between September 1, 2008 and February 28, 2010. The eligibility period was extended twice and ran through May 31, 2010. The COBRA subsidy under ARRA has caused more individuals to elect COBRA coverage. Beginning January 1, 2010, we began classifying certain claims-related costs, which were historically classified as administrative expenses, as benefit expense to better reflect costs incurred for our members’ traditional medical care as well as those expenses which improve our members’ health and medical outcomes. These reclassified costs are comprised of expenses incurred for: (i) medical management, including case and utilization management; (ii) health and wellness, including disease management services for such things as diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, congestive heart failure and asthma management and wellness initiatives like weight-loss programs and smoking cessation treatments; and (iii) clinical health policy. These types of claims-related costs ultimately lower our members’ cost of care. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. Our selling expense consists of external broker commission expenses, and generally varies with premium or membership volume. Our general and administrative expense consists of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Other costs are variable or discretionary in nature. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium, but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels, and thus associate compensation expense. Examples of discretionary costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity. 50 Table of Contents Our cost of drugs historically consisted of the amounts we paid to pharmaceutical companies for the drugs we sold via mail order through our PBM and specialty pharmacy companies until the sale of our PBM operations on December 1, 2009. This amount excluded the cost of drugs related to affiliated health customers recorded in benefit expense. Our cost of drugs was influenced by the volume of prescriptions in our PBM business, as well as cost changes, driven by prices set by pharmaceutical companies and the mix of drugs sold. Following the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts, we no longer record any cost of drugs on our income statement. Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management and health and wellness programs. Several economic factors related to health care costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating health care costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers and any regulatory or market driven restrictions on our ability to obtain adequate premium rates to offset overall inflation in health care costs, including increases in unit costs and utilization resulting from the aging of the population and other demographics, as well as advances in medical technology, may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material impact on our results of operations. Our future results of operations may also be impacted by certain external forces and resulting changes in our business model and strategy. During the first quarter of 2010, the U.S. Congress passed and the President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, as well as the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or HCERA, which represent significant changes to the current U.S. health care system. The legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage over time by increasing the eligibility thresholds for most state Medicaid programs and providing certain other individuals and small businesses with tax credits to subsidize a portion of the cost of health insurance coverage. The legislation includes a requirement that most individuals obtain health insurance coverage beginning in 2014 and that most large employers offer coverage to their employees or they will be required to pay a financial penalty. In addition, the new laws encompass certain new taxes and fees, including an excise tax on high premium insurance policies, limitations on the amount of compensation that is tax deductible and new fees on companies in our industry, some of which will not be deductible for income tax purposes. The legislation also imposes new regulations on the health insurance sector, including, but not limited to, guaranteed coverage requirements, prohibitions on some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to our members, increased restrictions on rescinding coverage, establishment of minimum medical loss ratio requirements, a requirement to cover preventive services on a first dollar basis, the establishment of state insurance exchanges and essential benefit packages and greater limitations on how we price certain of our products. The legislation also reduces the reimbursement levels for health plans participating in the Medicare Advantage program over time. These and other provisions of the new law are likely to have significant effects on our future operations, which, in turn, could impact the value of our business model and results of operations, including potential impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets. We will continue to evaluate the impact of this legislation as additional guidance is made available. For additional discussion, see Part I, Item 1. “Regulation” and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies may further restrict our ability to obtain new product approvals, implement changes in premium rates or impose additional restrictions, under new or existing laws that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. During June 2010, we resubmitted our March 2010 Individual market rate filings with the California Department of Insurance, or CDI, and the California Department of Managed Health Care, or CDMHC. We began implementing these rate increases on October 1, 2010. Based on the lower level of rate increases and delayed implementation, we incurred operating losses of approximately $112.0 million on our business in the 51 Table of Contents California Individual market during 2010. We recently filed proposed premium rate increases with the CDI and CDMHC for 2011 that are targeted to cover our expected cost trends. However, we cannot currently predict when those premium rate increases will be effective and whether the full year premiums will be sufficient to cover claims costs based on membership mix and renewal levels and actual underlying cost trends. In addition to external forces discussed in the preceding paragraphs, our results of operations are impacted by levels and mix of membership. In recent years, we have experienced membership declines due to unfavorable economic conditions. Given the current economic conditions in the U.S., it is expected that unemployment levels will remain high throughout 2011, which may impact our ability to increase or maintain current membership levels. In addition, we believe the self-insured portion of our group membership base will continue to increase. These membership trends could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Also see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form10-K. The National Organization of Life & Health Insurance Guaranty Associations, or NOLHGA, is a voluntary association consisting of the state life and health insurance guaranty organizations located throughout the U.S. State life and health insurance guaranty organizations, working together with NOLHGA, provide a safety net for their state’s policyholders, ensuring that they continue to receive coverage even if their insurer is declared insolvent. We are aware that the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner, or Insurance Commissioner, has placed Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary American Network Insurance Company, or collectively Penn Treaty, in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency. The Insurance Commissioner has petitioned the state court for liquidation; however, we do not know when a decision will be made, although we believe it is likely the state court will rule within the next twelve months. In the event that Penn Treaty is declared insolvent and placed in liquidation, we and other insurers may be required to pay a portion of their policyholder claims through state guaranty association assessments in future periods. Given the uncertainty around whether Penn Treaty will ultimately be declared insolvent and, if so, the amount of the insolvency, the amount and timing of any associated future guaranty fund assessments and the availability and amount of any potential premium tax and other offsets, we currently cannot estimate our net exposure, if any, to this potential insolvency. We will continue to monitor the situation and may record a liability and expense in future reporting periods, which could be material to our cash flows and results of operations. III. Significant Events Senior Credit Facility On September 30, 2010, we entered into a senior credit facility, or the facility, with certain lenders. The borrowings from the facility, if any, will be used for general corporate purposes. The facility provides credit up to $2.0 billion and matures on September 30, 2013. The interest rate on the facility is based on either, (i) the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined percentage rate based on our credit rating at the date of utilization, or (ii) a base rate as defined in the facility agreement plus a predetermined percentage rate based on our credit rating at the date of utilization. Our ability to borrow under the facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. This facility replaced our previous senior credit facility, which provided credit up to $2.4 billion. Bond Issue On August 12, 2010, we issued $700.0 million of 4.350% notes due 2020 and $300.0 million of 5.800% notes due 2040 under our shelf registration statement. We used the proceeds from this debt issuance to repay the remaining outstanding balance of our variable rate senior term loan and for general corporate purposes. The notes have a call feature that allows us to repurchase the notes at any time at our option and a put feature that allows a note holder to require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of both a change of control event and a downgrade of the notes. 52 Table of Contents Sale of PBM Business On December 1, 2009, we sold our PBM business to Express Scripts and received $4.7 billion in cash. The pre-tax and after-tax gains on the sale were $3.8 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. During the first quarter of 2010, we made tax payments of approximately $1.2 billion relating to the PBM sale. We also entered into a 10-year contract for Express Scripts to provide PBM services to our members. We expect this alliance to provide our members with more cost effective solutions as well as access to state-of-the-art PBM services. The results of operations of our PBM business have been included in our consolidated results through November 30, 2009. Announcement of Member Transition Agreement for UniCare Business On October 28, 2009, we announced that we entered into a member transition agreement with Health Care Service Corporation, or HCSC, which operates as Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Illinois and Texas. Under this agreement, HCSC offered guaranteed replacement coverage to our UniCare commercial group and individual members in those states. Starting on January 1, 2010, certain of our membership began transitioning to HCSC as a result of this agreement. The member transition agreement did not have a material effect on our consolidated cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. Acquisition of DeCare Dental, LLC On April 9, 2009, we completed our acquisition of DeCare Dental, LLC, or DeCare, a wholly-owned subsidiary of DeCare International. DeCare is one of the country’s largest administrators of dental benefit plans and provides services directly and through partnerships and administrative agreements with ten dental insurance brands, primarily as a third party administrator. DeCare manages dental benefits and provides our customers with innovative dental products and enhanced customer service. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of DeCare have been included in our consolidated results for periods following April 9, 2009. Suspension by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services During 2008, we worked with The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to resolve issues identified as a result of our internal compliance audits and findings from a 2008 CMS audit. Our work included detailed action plans to remediate such findings. In addition, we engaged an independent third party to provide CMS with on-going assessments regarding our compliance, including verification of systems, processes and procedures. On January 12, 2009, CMS notified us that we were suspended from marketing to and enrolling new members in our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D health benefit products until remediation efforts had been fully implemented and confirmed. On September 9, 2009, CMS notified us that the sanctions had been lifted subsequent to our remediation efforts. We began marketing our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D products on October 1, 2009 and began enrolling new members on November 15, 2009 for the 2010 contract year. We were not allowed to participate in the auto-enrollment or reassignment of Medicare Part D Low Income Subsidy, or LIS, beneficiaries beginning on October 1, 2008. We worked with CMS to demonstrate that our operations related to the Medicare PartD and LIS programs were corrected. CMS notified us on June 15, 2010 that we were again eligible to enroll LIS beneficiaries beginning July 1, 2010 with an effective date of September 1, 2010. Use of Capital and Stock Repurchase Program We regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock are at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future 53 Table of Contents liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Historically our common stock repurchase program, discussed below, has been our primary use of capital, and we have not previously paid any cash dividends on our common stock through December 31, 2010. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. The repurchases are effected from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase agreements, and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, as amended. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we repurchased and retired approximately 76.7 million shares at an average per share price of $56.86, for an aggregate cost of $4.4 billion. On January 26, October 29 and December 9, 2010, our Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by $3.5 billion, $500.0 million and $125.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, $148.5 million remained authorized for future repurchases. On February 3, 2011, our Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by $375.0 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2010, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $162.7 million, leaving approximately $360.8 million for authorized future repurchases at February 9, 2011. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares when we believe it is a prudent use of capital. Tax Resolutions During the year ended December 31, 2008, we settled disputes with the IRS relating to certain tax years and involving industry issues which we had been discussing with the IRS for several years. For certain years, tax positions have been resolved but the overall tax year may require additional approval from the Joint Committee on Taxation before it can be finalized in total. In addition, tax litigation in the U.S. Tax Court concluded adversely to us during 2008. This adverse decision was appealed. In March, 2010 the Court of Appeals in the Seventh Circuit issued a decision ruling that various payments made to several states in prior years should be deferred tax assets and not a current tax deduction for the year being litigated. The Company is in discussions with the IRS as to the appropriate treatment of the deferred tax assets. IV. Membership—December 31, 2010 Compared to December 31, 2009 Our medical membership includes seven different customer types: Local Group, Individual, National Accounts, BlueCard, Senior, State-Sponsored and FEP. BCBSA-branded business refers to members in our service, or geographic, areas licensed by the BCBSA. Non-BCBSA-branded business refers to UniCare members predominately outside of our BCBSA service areas. • Local Group (including UniCare) consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. • Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 (including UniCare) and their covered dependents. • National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in a WellPoint service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker relationships. • BlueCard host members represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by WellPoint who receive health care services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a 54 Table of Contents non-WellPoint controlled BCBSA licensee (i.e., the “home” plan). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard claims received per month. • Senior members are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a managed care alternative for the Medicare program, who have purchased Medicare Supplement benefit coverage, some disabled under 65, or all ages with End Stage Renal Disease. • State-Sponsored membership represents eligible members with State-Sponsored managed care alternatives in Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Plan programs. • FEP members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some self-funded customers choose to purchase stop-loss coverage to limit their retained risk. 55 Table of Contents The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Also included below are other membership data by product. The medical membership and other businesses’ metrics presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

Medical Membership During the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, total medical membership decreased 347,000, or 1%, primarily due to decreases in Local Group (including UniCare) and Individual non-BCBSA-branded membership resulting from the transition of certain UniCare members to HCSC beginning January 1, 2010. These declines were partially offset by increases in our National Accounts, FEP, Senior and State Sponsored membership. Self-funded medical membership increased 1,354,000, or 7%, primarily due to the conversions from fully-insured to self-funded status of both a large municipal account and a large state employer account in April and July 2010, respectively, and an increase in self-funded National Accounts membership driven by additional sales, partially offset by declines in self-funded non-BCBSA branded Local Group membership. 56 Table of Contents Fully-insured membership decreased 1,701,000 members, or 11%, primarily due to the conversions from fully-insured to self-funded status of both a large municipal account and a large state employer account in April and July 2010, respectively, the transition of certain UniCare members to HCSC (both Local Group and Individual membership) and declines in fully-insured Local Group membership driven by lapses. Local Group membership decreased 427,000, or 3%, primarily due to membership declines in our non-BCBSA-branded membership, including the impact of the transition of certain UniCare members to HCSC, and a decline in BCBSA-branded business associated with the unfavorable economic conditions. Individual membership decreased 226,000, or 11%, primarily due to the transition of certain UniCare members to HCSC. National Accounts membership increased 216,000, or 3%, primarily driven by additional sales, reflective of our extensive and cost-effective provider networks and a broad and innovative product portfolio, and favorable in-group enrollment changes in several large accounts. These increases were partially offset by lapses due to the unfavorable economic conditions. BlueCard membership decreased 33,000, or 1%, primarily due to decreased utilization by other BCBSA licensee members who reside in or travel to our licensed areas. Senior membership increased 44,000, or 4%, primarily due to increases in our Medicare Advantage plans, partially offset by lower membership in our Medicare Supplement plans. State-Sponsored membership increased 23,000, or 1%, primarily due to growth in Virginia, South Carolina, Wisconsin and Indiana, partially offset by lower membership in California resulting from product changes and competition. FEP membership increased 56,000, or 4%, following the 2010 open enrollment period. Other Membership Our Other products are often ancillary to our health business, and can therefore be impacted by corresponding changes in our medical membership. Behavioral health membership increased 998,000, or 4%, primarily due to new sales to several major accounts, partially offset by higher unemployment resulting from the current economic conditions. Life and disability membership decreased 192,000, or 4%, primarily due to the transition of certain UniCare members to HCSC beginning January 1, 2010. Life and disability products are generally offered as a part of Commercial medical fully-insured membership sales. Dental membership decreased 277,000, or 6%, primarily due to lapses and net unfavorable in-group enrollment changes due to the current economic conditions and the transition of certain UniCare members to HCSC. Managed dental membership increased 323,000, or 8%, primarily due to new sales to two large accounts. Vision membership increased 420,000, or 14%, primarily due to strong sales and market penetration of our Blue View vision product within the Local Group markets and embedding of vision benefits in certain of our Consumer products, partially offset by the transition of certain UniCare members to HCSC and lapses. Medicare Part D membership decreased 261,000, or 17%, primarily reflecting the loss of certain 2010 Part D LIS membership. 57 Table of Contents V. Cost of Care The following discussion summarizes our aggregate underlying cost of care trends for the rolling 12 months ended December 31, 2010 for our Local Group fully-insured business only. As previously discussed, these costs are influenced by our mix of managed care products, including PPO, HMO, POS and CDHP products, in addition to changes in the unit costs and utilization levels. Our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing the year-over-year change in average per member per month claim costs, including member co-payments and deductibles. While our cost of care trend varies by geographic location, based on underlying medical cost trends we estimate that our aggregate cost of care trend was between 6.0% and 6.5% for the full year of 2010. Overall, our medical cost trend was driven more by unit cost than utilization. Inpatient hospital trend was in the very high single digit range and was primarily related to increases in cost per admission. Primary contributors to unit cost trends include elevated average case acuity (intensity) as well as negotiated rate increases with hospitals. We are continually working to lower cost trends as we negotiate with hospitals. We remain committed to optimizing our reimbursement rates and strategies to help address the cost pressures faced by employers and consumers. Inpatient admission counts per thousand members were lower than prior year; however, inpatient day counts per thousand members were slightly higher. As a result, the average length of inpatient stays increased slightly compared to prior year levels. Clinical management and re-contracting efforts are in place to help mitigate the inpatient trend. Focused review efforts continue in key areas, including inpatient behavioral health stays and spinal surgery cases, among others. Additionally, we have introduced new programs related to readmission management, focused utilization management at high costs facilities, and post-discharge follow-up care. Outpatient trend was in the high single digit range and was 85% cost driven and 15% utilization driven. Outpatient costs are a collection of different types of expenses, such as outpatient facilities, labs, x-rays, emergency room, and occupational and physical therapy. Per visit costs are still the largest contributor to overall outpatient trend, influenced largely by price increases within certain provider contracts. Outpatient utilization (visits per thousand members) was only slightly higher than the prior year. We continue to work with vendors and providers to help optimize site of service decisions including key areas such as emergency room vs. urgent care, laboratory service location (hospital vs. free-standing lab), and surgery settings (hospital vs. ambulatory surgical center). Continued expansion and optimization of our utilization management programs is also serving to moderate trend. Additionally, we continued to see the positive impact of incorporating the technology of our American Imaging Management, Inc., or AIM, subsidiary. This is allowing us to achieve greater efficiencies in the high trend area of radiology, ensuring that consumers receive the quality tests they need. Leveraging AIM’s platform and expertise in areas such as nuclear cardiology management, specialty pharmacy reviews and myocardial perfusion imaging is aiding our efforts to mitigate trend increases. Physician services trend was in the low-to-mid single digit range and was 55% cost driven and 45% utilization driven. Increases in the physician care category were partially driven by contracting changes. We continue to collaborate with physicians to improve quality of care through pay-for-performance programs. Pharmacy trend was in the mid single digit range and was 70% unit cost (cost per prescription) related and 30% utilization (prescriptions per member per year) driven. Recent inflation in the average wholesale price of drugs is applying upward pressure to the overall cost per prescription as is the increased use of specialty drugs. Specialty drugs, also known as biotech drugs, are generally higher cost and are being utilized more frequently. The increase in cost per prescription measures were mitigated by favorable unit cost pricing resulting from our Express Scripts transaction, increases in our generic usage rates and benefit plan design changes. We are continuously evaluating our drug formulary to ensure the most effective pharmaceutical therapies are available to our members. 58 Table of Contents In response to cost trends, we continue to pursue contracting and plan design changes, promote and implement performance-based contracts that reward clinical outcomes and quality, and expand our radiology management, disease management and advanced care management programs. We are taking a leadership role in the area of payment reform, having introduced a number of new reimbursement models throughout 2010. We are currently working with three provider organizations in Accountable Care Organization pilot programs. These programs are designed to enhance coordination of care throughout the health system, appropriately align incentives and encourage responsibility among patients, payors and providers to enhance member health outcomes. We are also advancing ten patient-centered medical home programs in eight of our states to help modernize and increase the scope of the primary care practices throughout our markets. Early assessment of these programs demonstrates a favorable impact to the quality and cost of health care, and we will continue evaluating their results over the next few years. Additionally, our Resolution Health, Inc., or RHI, subsidiary is allowing us to fully integrate their suite of products aimed to improve health care quality and reduce health care costs. As an example, My Health Advantage is an RHI product that uses market-leading technology to analyze medical claims, pharmacy claims, lab results, benefit plan information and personal health information to identify opportunities to help close gaps between recommended care and the care that members actually receive. Furthermore, the sale of our PBM business and the resulting strategic alliance with Express Scripts is bringing with it greater capabilities and resources, allowing members to leverage more cost-effective solutions and state-of-the-art PBM services. 59 Table of Contents VI. Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are discussed in the following section.

The decrease in premiums related to the conversions of the large municipal account and large state employer account was largely offset by a comparable reduction of benefit expense, as further described below. These decreases in premiums were partially offset by higher premiums that were necessary to cover expected cost trends, increased reimbursement in the FEP program and increased membership in our Senior Medicare Advantage business. Administrative fees decreased $6.6 million, or less than 1%, to $3.8 billion in 2010, primarily due to reductions of certain PBM related revenues earned in 2009 which are not reflected in 2010 due to the sale of our PBM in December 2009 and lower revenues in our NGS Medicare business, partially offset by increased revenue in our self-funded National Accounts business resulting from both membership and rate increases. The majority of other revenue was historically comprised of co-payments and deductibles associated with the sale of mail-order prescription drugs by our PBM companies. The decline in other revenue is due to the sale of our PBM business in December 2009. Accordingly, our operating results do not reflect other revenue for this business in 2010, and other revenue of $36.5 million recorded in 2010 is primarily associated with miscellaneous activities. Net investment income increased $2.3 million, or less than 1%, to $803.3 million in 2010, primarily resulting from dividends of $30.0 million received in 2010 related to one of our cost method investments and increased income from equity method investments, partially offset by lower yields earned on short-term and fixed maturity investments. Gain on sale of business recognized in 2009 resulted from the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts in December 2009. A summary of our net realized gains (losses) on investments for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 $ Change 2010 2009 (In millions) Net realized gains on investments Net realized gains from the sale of fixed maturity securities $ 229.0 $ 22.8 $ 206.2 Net realized (losses) gains from the sale of equity securities (23.7 ) 35.0 (58.7 ) Other net realized losses on investments (11.2 ) (1.4 ) (9.8 ) Net realized gains on investments 194.1 56.4 137.7 Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income Other-than-temporary impairment losses—equity securities (15.0 ) (232.6 ) 217.6 Other-than-temporary impairment losses—fixed maturity securities (24.4 ) (217.6 ) 193.2 Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income (39.4 ) (450.2 ) 410.8 Net realized gains on investments and other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income $ 154.7 $ (393.8 ) $ 548.5 Net realized gains on investments increased in 2010 primarily due to increased gains from the sale of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by increased net realized losses from equity securities. 61 Table of Contents Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income decreased in 2010. Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income in 2009 were related to both impairment of fixed maturity securities, primarily from credit related events, and impairment of equity securities due to declines in stock prices. There was no individually significant other-than-temporary impairment of investments by issuer during the years ended December 31, 2010 or 2009. For a discussion of our investment impairment review process, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” within this MD&A. Benefit expense decreased $2.2 billion, or 5%, to $44.9 billion in 2010, primarily due to the conversions of a large municipal account and a large state employer account from fully-insured to self-funded status in April and July 2010, respectively, fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group and National Accounts business, certain UniCare members transitioning to HCSC beginning January 1, 2010 and the loss of a portion of the 2010 Part D LIS membership within our Senior business. These decreases were partially offset by increases in benefit costs in our Local Group BCBSA-branded business, which were driven primarily by higher unit costs. In addition, our Senior Medicare Advantage and FEP businesses both experienced increased benefit costs. The Medicare Advantage and FEP related increases in benefit expense were due to both higher membership and unit costs. We receive reimbursement for FEP costs plus a fee. In 2010, we lowered our targeted margin for adverse deviation in our medical claims payable balance from the high single digit range to the mid-to-upper single digit range. This resulted in a reduction of benefit expense of $67.7 million in 2010. In addition, we recognized $247.0 million of higher than expected reserve releases during 2010 compared to $262.0 million in 2009. For additional discussion about our medical claims reserving methodologies, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” within this MD&A. Our benefit expense ratio decreased 40 basis points to 83.2% in 2010, due to improvements in our Commercial segment, partially offset by increases in our Consumer segment. Improvements in the Commercial segment were primarily related to our Local Group BCBSA-branded business, which reflected disciplined pricing and lower flu-related costs, year over year, and a positive impact from the change in reserves discussed above. Our Consumer segment increases were related to benefit costs in our Senior Medicare Advantage business due to the reduction in federal reimbursement rates for 2010, and a less favorable impact from the change in reserves described above. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $271.0 million, or 3%, to $8.8 billion in 2010. Our selling, general and administrative expense decreased due to lower base compensation costs, premium taxes and other fees, advertising expenses, selling expenses and other operating expenses, partially offset by increases in incentive compensation expenses, outside services costs and asset impairments. Our 2010 general and administrative expenses also no longer include the administrative expenses formerly incurred by our PBM business. As further described in Note 4, “Restructuring Activities,” to our audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 included in this Form 10-K, we recorded restructuring costs for severance, asset impairments and other exit costs of $140.9 million and $171.6 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively, which are included in selling, general and administrative expense described above. While our selling, general and administrative expense decreased, our selling, general and administrative expense ratio increased 30 basis points to 15.3% in 2010, primarily due to a decline in operating revenue, increased incentive compensation costs, outside services costs and asset impairments, partially offset by lower base compensation costs and premium taxes and other fees. Cost of drugs sold decreased $419.0 million, or 100%, due to no PBM activity in 2010 as compared to 2009. These cost of drugs sold were associated with other revenue generated from mail order sales of drugs. Following the sale of our PBM business, we do not record any cost of drugs on our income statement as we no longer market and sell prescription drugs. 62 Table of Contents Interest expense decreased $28.5 million, or 6%, to $418.9 million in 2010, primarily due to lower average debt balances and lower short-term rates on floating rate debt. Amortization of other intangible assets decreased $24.3 million, or 9%, to $241.7 million in 2010, primarily due to reduced balances of certain amortizable intangible assets acquired in prior years. Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets decreased $241.4 million, or 92%, to $21.1 million in 2010. In the first quarter of 2010, we recognized an impairment charge of $21.1 million for certain intangible assets associated with the UniCare provider networks, due to a decision we made to transfer certain membership to an alternative network. During the third and fourth quarters of 2009 we identified and recorded pre-tax impairment charges relating to our UniCare trade names of $262.5 million, the majority of which was driven by the loss of certain 2010 Part D LIS membership. Income tax expense decreased $1.2 billion, or 45%, to $1.5 billion in 2010. This decrease was essentially due to lower income before income tax expense in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to the gain on sale from our PBM business recorded in 2009. The effective tax rates in 2010 and 2009 were 33.7% and 35.9%, respectively, but the decline in effective rates did not have a material impact on the lower overall income tax expense. The decrease in effective tax rates resulted primarily from the impact of the PBM sale in 2009 which produced a higher effective tax rate. The factors noted above led to net income as a percentage of total revenue decreasing 240 basis points to 4.9% in 2010 as compared to 2009. Excluding the gain on sale in 2009, our net income as a percentage of total revenue was 3.9% in 2009. Reportable Segments We use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, which are Commercial, Consumer and Other. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, selling, general and administrative expense and cost of drugs. It does not include net investment income, gain on sale of business, net realized gains/losses on investments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. For additional information, see Note 20, “Segment Information,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 included in this Form 10-K. The discussions of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Commercial Our Commercial segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2010 2009 $ Change % Change (In millions) Operating revenue $ 34,662.6 $ 37,363.4 $ (2,700.8 ) (7 )% Operating gain $ 3,085.7 $ 2,430.3 $ 655.4 27 % Operating margin 8.9 % 6.5 % 240 bp 63 Table of Contents Operating revenue decreased $2.7 billion, or 7%, to $34.7 billion in 2010, primarily due to the conversions of a large municipal account and state employer account from fully-insured to self-funded status during 2010. Operating revenue also decreased due to fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group BCBSA-branded business and National Accounts business due to unfavorable economic conditions. In addition, operating revenue decreased due to certain UniCare members transitioning to HCSC beginning January 1, 2010. These decreases were partially offset by higher premiums that were necessary to cover expected cost trend, increased revenue in our self-funded National Accounts and Local Group businesses and managed dental administrative revenues. Operating gain increased $655.4 million, or 27%, to $3.1 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher margins in our Local Group BCBSA-branded business, partially offset by fully insured membership declines. The higher margins in our Local Group BCBSA-branded business reflected higher premiums necessary to cover cost trend and lower than expected medical costs, due primarily to lower than expected utilization and lower flu-related costs. The operating gain also improved approximately $99.0 million due to additional favorable reserve releases in 2010 as compared to 2009. The factors above led to an operating margin in 2010 of 8.9%, a 240 basis point increase over 2009. Consumer Our Consumer segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2010 2009 $ Change % Change (In millions) Operating revenue $ 16,092.6 $ 16,141.8 $ (49.2 ) — % Operating gain $ 1,000.6 $ 1,279.7 $ (279.1 ) (22 )% Operating margin 6.2 % 7.9 % (170 )bp Operating revenue decreased $49.2 million, or less than 1%, to $16.1 billion in 2010, primarily due to our loss of certain 2010 Part D LIS membership and, to a lesser degree, lower membership in our Individual and Medicare Supplement businesses and a change during 2010 in the provider of pharmacy benefits for the Indiana Medicaid program included in our State-Sponsored programs. These decreases were partially offset by increases in our Medicare Advantage business due to higher membership. Operating gain decreased $279.1 million, or 22%, to $1.0 billion in 2010, primarily due to lower operating gain in our Medicare Advantage business due to the reduction in federal reimbursement rates for 2010 and overall higher administrative costs, which included asset impairments. Approximately $46.0 million of the decline was due to lower favorable reserve releases in 2010 as compared to 2009. These operating gain declines were partially offset by improved results in our Medicare Part D and Medicare Supplement businesses. The factors above led to an operating margin in 2010 of 6.2%, a 170 basis point decrease from 2009. Other Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2010 2009 $ Change % Change (In millions) Operating revenue $ 7,088.6 $ 7,323.4 $ (234.8 ) (3 )% Operating (loss) gain $ (8.8 ) $ 469.4 $ (478.2 ) NM 1 64 Table of Contents Operating revenue decreased $234.8 million, or 3%, to $7.1 billion in 2010, primarily due to the sale of the PBM business on December 1, 2009 and lower administrative fees in our NGS Medicare business, partially offset by growth in our FEP business. Operating gain decreased $478.2 million to an operating loss of $8.8 million in 2010, primarily due to the sale of the PBM business on December 1, 2009 and higher unallocated operating expenses. VII. Membership—December 31, 2009 Compared to December 31, 2008 The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Also included below are other businesses’ key metrics, including prescription volume for our PBM companies and other membership data by product. The medical membership and other businesses’ metrics presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

Managed dental membership includes members acquired through the DeCare acquisition for which we provide administrative services only. 2 NM = Not meaningful. 3 PBM business was sold to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009 resulting in eleven months of PBM volume reported for 2009. 4 Mail order scripts generally cover a 60 or 90 day supply with a weighted average supply of 86 days. The mail order script volume shown in the above table has been adjusted to reflect a 30 day supply. Medical Membership During the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, total medical membership decreased 1,379,000, or 4%, primarily due to decreases in Local Group (including UniCare), State-Sponsored, Individual and Senior businesses, partially offset by increases in our National Accounts membership. The majority of the decline was in our Local Group business and primarily reflects lapses and net unfavorable in-group change caused by higher unemployment resulting from the current economic downturn partially offset by new sales. In-group enrollment change represents membership changes within a group that still remains our customer. Self-funded medical membership decreased 284,000, or 2%, primarily due to declines in self-funded Local Group membership resulting from lapses and net unfavorable in-group change caused by higher unemployment and withdrawal from the Connecticut Medicaid program, partially offset by an increase in self-funded National Account membership resulting from additional sales and ongoing conversions to self-funded arrangements. Fully-insured membership decreased by 1,095,000 members, or 7%, primarily due to declines in fully-insured Local Group membership resulting from lapses and net unfavorable in-group enrollment change caused by higher unemployment partially offset by new sales, reduced Individual membership, partially caused by the current economic downturn, lower membership in certain California State-Sponsored programs and ongoing conversions to self-funded arrangements. Local Group membership decreased 989,000, or 6%, primarily due to membership declines in our BCBSA-branded business, and to a lesser extent, our UniCare business. These declines were primarily related to lapses and net unfavorable in-group enrollment changes associated with the current economic downturn partially offset by new sales. Certain of our UniCare members began transitioning to HCSC on January 1, 2010. Individual membership decreased 141,000, or 6%, due to competitive pricing pressures and overall economic conditions. This decline was weighted slightly more toward our BCBSA-branded business, but was also driven by UniCare. Certain of our UniCare members began transitioning to HCSC on January 1, 2010. National Accounts membership increased 93,000, or 1%, primarily driven by additional sales, reflective of our extensive and cost-effective provider networks and a broad and innovative product portfolio. These increases were partially offset by lapses and net unfavorable in-group enrollment changes due to the current economic downturn. BlueCard membership increased 8,000, or less than 1%, primarily due to increased utilization by other BCBSA licensee members who reside in or travel to our licensed areas. Senior membership decreased 89,000, or 7%, primarily due to the loss of membership from product portfolio changes implemented in 2009 for certain Medicare Advantage plans, including withdrawal from selected plans and lower membership in Medicare Supplement. State-Sponsored membership decreased 259,000, or 13%, primarily due to our strategic withdrawal from the Connecticut and Nevada Medicaid programs and certain California State-Sponsored programs partially offset by growth in Indiana as a competitor exited the state. 66 Table of Contents Other Membership Our Other products are often ancillary to our health business, and can therefore be impacted by corresponding changes in our medical membership. Behavioral health membership decreased 603,000, or 3%, primarily due to higher unemployment resulting from the current economic downturn, partially offset by growth in certain products. Life and disability membership decreased 84,000, or 2%, primarily due to lapses and net unfavorable in-group enrollment changes associated with the current economic downturn and increasing unemployment. Life and disability products are generally offered as a part of Commercial medical fully-insured membership sales. Dental membership decreased 276,000, or 6%, primarily due to net unfavorable in-group enrollment changes and lapses due to the current economic downturn, partially offset by new sales to several groups and members acquired with DeCare on April 9, 2009. Managed dental membership increased 3,949,000 reflecting our acquisition of DeCare on April 9, 2009. Vision membership increased 474,000, or 18%, primarily due to continued sales and market penetration of our Blue View vision product, partially offset by lapses and net unfavorable in-group changes. Medicare Part D membership decreased 361,000, or 19%, as the CMS sanctions prevented us from capturing sales from new business to offset declines, including those from normal attrition. PBM Prescription Volume PBM prescription volume was completely transferred to Express Scripts as a result of the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009. For the eleven months ended November 30, 2009 as compared to November 30, 2008, prescription volume decreased 2,009,000, or 1%, primarily due to a decrease in retail scripts resulting from lower membership driven by the current economic conditions and the exit from a joint venture in the Northeast. The declines were partially offset by increases in script volume as our PBM business began servicing approximately one million members transferred from an outside vendor on January 1, 2009. 67 Table of Contents VIII. Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are discussed in the following section.

These decreases were partially offset by premium rate increases for all medical lines of business and increased reimbursement in the FEP program. Administrative fees remained level at $3.8 billion in 2009, primarily due to increased pricing in our Local Group self-funded business, self-funded membership growth in National Accounts, revenue from DeCare following the acquisition, offset by the impact of our withdrawal from the Connecticut Medicaid program. Other revenue is comprised principally of co-payments and deductibles associated with the sale of mail-order prescription drugs by our PBM companies, which provided services to members of our Commercial and Consumer segments and third party clients. Other revenue decreased $35.3 million, or 6%, to $606.3 million in 2009, primarily due to one less month of PBM revenue as compared to 2008, resulting from the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009 and decreased mail order script volume from third parties prior to the sale, partially offset by proceeds from the UniCare member transition agreement with HCSC and DeCare revenues following the acquisition of DeCare on April 9, 2009. Net investment income decreased $50.1 million, or 6%, to $801.0 million in 2009, primarily resulting from reduced investment balances, prior to the receipt of the PBM sale proceeds, and lower yields on short-term investments. Gain on sale of business of $3.8 billion represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts. We received $4.7 billion in cash. A summary of our net realized gains (losses) on investments for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 2009 2008 $ Change (In millions) Net realized gains on investments Net realized gains (losses) from the sale of fixed maturity securities $ 22.8 $ (46.9 ) $ 69.7 Net realized gains from the sale of equity securities 35.0 28.3 6.7 Other net realized (losses) gains on investments (1.4 ) 47.3 (48.7 ) Net realized gains on investments 56.4 28.7 27.7 Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income Other-than-temporary impairment losses—equity securities (232.6 ) (728.1 ) 495.5 Other-than-temporary impairment losses—fixed maturity securities (217.6 ) (479.8 ) 262.2 Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income (450.2 ) (1,207.9 ) 757.7 Net realized gains on investments and other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income $ (393.8 ) $ (1,179.2 ) $ 785.4 Net realized gains on investments increased in 2009 primarily due to increased gains from the sale of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by declines in realized gains on other investments. 69 Table of Contents Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income in 2009 were equally related to impairment of fixed maturity securities, primarily from declines in credit ratings and declines in equity securities. There was no individually significant other-than-temporary impairment of investments by issuer during the year ended December 31, 2009. Net realized gains/losses on investments and other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income for the year ended December 31, 2008 were primarily driven by other-than-temporary impairments related to the deterioration in equity markets, and to a lesser extent, other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities. The other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income included $135.0 million, $106.6 million, and $90.2 million, respectively, for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., or Lehman (or their respective subsidiaries, as appropriate) that were recorded in 2008. For a discussion of our investment impairment review process, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” within this MD&A. Benefit expense decreased $1.1 billion, or 2%, to $47.1 billion in 2009, primarily due to fully-insured membership declines across our Commercial and Consumer businesses, including results from our strategic actions taken with State- Sponsored programs that led to the withdrawal from certain programs. In addition, we experienced higher than anticipated prior year favorable reserve releases of an estimated $262.0 million during 2009 that were not reestablished at December 31, 2009. Finally, lower benefit expense in our Senior business contributed to the overall decrease in benefit expense. The lower benefit expense in the Senior business included reduced benefit expense for Medicare Advantage, which primarily reflected product portfolio changes and pricing adjustments that were implemented in 2009. These decreases were partially offset by increases in benefit costs in our Local Group and FEP businesses. The increase in Local Group benefit costs were driven by higher unit costs and the impact of the recession on business mix changes, including higher COBRA membership and increased utilization. We are refining our product offerings, expanding membership retention programs, driving cost of care initiatives and implementing pricing actions to favorably impact our Local Group business. Our benefit expense ratio decreased 90 basis points to 83.6% in 2009, due to improvements in our Consumer segment, partially offset by increases in our Commercial segment. Both our Consumer and Commercial segments benefited from higher than anticipated prior year favorable reserve releases of an estimated $262.0 million during 2009 that were not reestablished at December 31, 2009, which favorably impacted the benefit expense ratio by 46 basis points. The decline in the Consumer segment benefit expense ratio was also driven by improvements in our Senior business, primarily due to product portfolio changes and pricing adjustments in Medicare Advantage that were implemented for 2009, and improved results in State-Sponsored business due to certain strategic actions that have been undertaken. These decreases in the benefit expense ratio were partially offset by a higher ratio for Local Group business, reflecting higher unit costs and the impact of the recession on business mix changes, including higher COBRA membership and increased utilization. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $613.2 million, or 7%, to $9.1 billion in 2009. Our selling, general and administrative expense increased due to higher incentive compensation costs and outside services. In addition, as further described in Note 4, “Restructuring Activities,” to the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, included in this Form 10-K, we recorded $171.6 million of restructuring costs during the fourth quarter of 2009. These expenses were partially offset by lower selling expenses. These drivers, as well as lower operating revenue resulting from declining membership, caused our selling, general and administrative expense ratio to increase 120 basis points to 15.0% in 2009. Cost of drugs sold decreased $49.5 million, or 11%, to $419.0 million in 2009, primarily due to one less month of PBM activity as compared to 2008, resulting from the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009 and decreased mail order prescription volume from third parties prior to the sale. Interest expense decreased $22.4 million, or 5%, to $447.4 million in 2009, primarily due to a reduced use of commercial paper and the repurchase of our zero coupon notes, partially offset by slightly higher interest rates on new debt, including the issuance of $1.0 billion of long-term debt in February 2009. 70 Table of Contents Amortization of other intangible assets decreased $20.1 million, or 7%, to $266.0 million in 2009, primarily due to reductions in amortization of certain other intangible assets acquired in prior years and ceasing amortization related to PBM intangible assets due to the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009. Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets increased $121.1 million, or 86%, to $262.5 million in 2009. As further discussed in Note 10, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, the anticipated closing of the PBM sale, the expected decline in 2010 Medicare Part D auto-assigned membership and the anticipated transition of our Illinois and Texas UniCare commercial group and individual members to HCSC, triggered an interim impairment review of our UniCare tradenames as of September 30, 2009. As a result, we identified and recorded a pre-tax impairment charge relating to our UniCare tradenames during the third quarter of 2009, the majority of which was driven by the loss of the 2010 low margin Medicare Part D auto-assigned membership. Subsequently, primarily in connection with the December 2009 closing of the PBM sale and the execution of the HCSC agreement, we initiated an impairment review of goodwill associated with our UniCare subsidiaries during the fourth quarter and also updated a previous impairment review of our UniCare tradename. These reviews resulted in an impairment charge of $57.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 to adjust the carrying values of the goodwill and intangible assets to their estimated fair values. As a result, total impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets were $262.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. During 2008, due to ongoing changes in the economic and regulatory environment in our State-Sponsored business, including California budgetary cuts, we revised our outlook for this business in certain states. This revision triggered an interim impairment review of our indefinite lived intangible assets related to State-Sponsored licenses in certain states, and we identified and recorded a pre-tax impairment charge relating to certain intangible assets of $141.4 million during 2008. Income tax expense increased $2.0 billion to $2.7 billion in 2009. During 2009 income tax expense was higher as we recorded income tax expense of $1.4 billion related to the sale of our PBM business and as a result of increased income before income tax expense. During 2008, income tax expense was lower due to a combination of settlement of disputes with the IRS relating to certain prior tax years, lower state income taxes due to changes in the composition of the apportionment factors in our combined state income tax returns, settlements of disputes on state audits and lower income before income tax expense. The effective tax rates in 2009 and 2008 were 35.9% and 20.2%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2008 was primarily due to the settlement of the outstanding IRS disputes. Our net income as a percentage of total revenue increased 320 basis points, from 4.1% in 2008 to 7.3% in 2009, primarily due to the gain on the sale of our PBM business. Excluding the gain on sale, our net income as a percentage of total revenue was 3.9% in 2009. Reportable Segments We use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, which are Commercial, Consumer and Other. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, selling, general and administrative expense and cost of drugs. It does not include net investment income, gain on sale of business, net realized gains (losses) on investments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. For additional information, see Note 20, “Segment Information,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 included in this Form 10-K. The discussions of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 71 Table of Contents Commercial Our Commercial segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 $ Change % Change 2009 2008 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 37,363.4 $ 38,009.3 $ (645.9 ) (2 )% Operating gain $ 2,430.3 $ 3,392.7 $ (962.4 ) (28 )% Operating margin 6.5 % 8.9 % (240 )bp Operating revenue decreased $645.9 million, or 2%, to $37.4 billion in 2009, primarily due to fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group, UniCare and National businesses due to economic factors. These decreases were partially offset by premium rate increases for all medical lines of business, increased membership in our self-funded National business, increased fees in our Local Group self-funded business and revenues from DeCare following our acquisition of DeCare in April, 2009. Operating gain decreased $962.4 million, or 28%, to $2.4 billion in 2009 primarily due to higher benefit expenses in our Local Group business, overall increased administrative costs and fully-insured membership declines resulting from the current economic conditions. The higher benefit expenses in our Local Group business were driven by higher unit costs and business mix changes, including higher COBRA membership and increased utilization. Administrative costs primarily increased due to a fourth quarter restructuring charge of $127.0 million and higher overall compensation costs. These operating gain declines were partially offset by premium rate increases and the impact of an estimated $81.0 million in higher than anticipated favorable prior year reserve releases that were not reestablished at December 31, 2009. The operating margin in 2009 was 6.5%, a 240 basis point decrease from 2008 primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Consumer Our Consumer segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as follows: Years EndedDecember 31 $ Change % Change 2009 2008 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 16,141.8 $ 16,437.3 $ (295.5 ) (2 )% Operating gain $ 1,279.7 $ 585.1 $ 694.6 119 % Operating margin 7.9 % 3.6 % 430 bp Operating revenue decreased $295.5 million, or 2%, to $16.1 billion in 2009, primarily due to our withdrawal from certain State-Sponsored programs, most notably the Ohio Medicaid programs, membership declines in Senior business and declines in our fully-insured Individual membership, partially offset by premium rate increases in all lines of business. Operating gain increased $694.6 million, or 119%, to $1.3 billion in 2009, primarily due to higher than anticipated prior year favorable reserve releases of an estimated $181.0 million in 2009 that were not reestablished at December 31, 2009, as well as improved results in our Senior business as we implemented benefit design changes and modified pricing for 2009. We also had improved results in our State-Sponsored business due to strategic actions taken, including withdrawal from certain unprofitable contracts as well as working with individual states on certain benefit design changes. 72 Table of Contents The operating margin in 2009 was 7.9%, a 430 basis point increase over 2008 primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Other Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31 $ Change % Change 2009 2008 (In millions) Operating revenue $ 7,323.4 $ 7,132.6 $ 190.8 3 % Operating gain $ 469.4 $ 370.0 $ 99.4 27 % Operating revenue increased $190.8 million, or 3%, to $7.3 billion in 2009, primarily due to higher premiums in our FEP business, partially offset by lower administrative fees in our NGS business and one less month of PBM revenue in 2009 as compared to 2008, resulting from the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts. Operating gain increased $99.4 million, or 27%, to $469.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase was due to improved results for the first eleven months of 2009 in our PBM business, primarily with respect to our retail and specialty pharmacy operations, and as NextRx began servicing approximately one million customers transferred from an outside vendor on January 1, 2009. Our PBM business was sold to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009; results of the PBM business are included in our results until the sale date. In addition, operating gain in our disease management and cost of care businesses increased. These increases were partially offset by higher unallocated incentive compensation expense. As a consequence of the PBM sale, the future operating results of the Other segment will no longer benefit from the operating revenue and operating gain associated with the PBM business. IX. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider some of our most important accounting policies that require estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, included in this Form 10-K. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. Medical Claims Payable The most judgmental accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2010, this liability was $4.9 billion and represented 18% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an 73 Table of Contents estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 97.0%, or $4.7 billion, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2010; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 3.0%, or $147.6 million, of the total medical claims payable as of December 31, 2010. The level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period end to the next, from 1% to 5% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made. Liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be appropriate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or “trend factors.” Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison of prior year, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense. In addition to incurred but not paid claims, the liability for medical claims payable includes reserves for premium deficiencies, if appropriate. Premium deficiencies are recognized when it is probable that expected claims and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums on existing medical insurance contracts without consideration of investment income. Determination of premium deficiencies for longer duration life and disability contracts includes consideration of investment income. For purposes of premium deficiencies, contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. No premium deficiencies were established at year end 2010. We regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to 74 Table of Contents claim liabilities occur each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable. In 2010, higher than anticipated favorable reserve releases of approximately $247.0 million were recognized and not reestablished at December 31, 2010. The majority of these releases resulted from year end claim seasonality developing to be less severe than originally anticipated, as well as continued recognition of improvements in our processing environment. While there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid liability as of December 31, 2010 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by other operational variables including system changes, provider submission patterns and business combinations. There is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through 12 months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. In our analysis for the claim liabilities at December 31, 2010, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 40 and 90 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower variability ranging from 0 to 30 basis points. The difference in completion factor assumptions, assuming moderately adverse experience, results in variability of 2%, or approximately $118.0 million, in the December 31, 2010 incurred but not paid claim liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein. The other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2010 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. In our analysis for the period ended December 31, 2010, there was a 310 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors assuming moderately adverse experience. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 5%, or approximately $229.0 million, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factors used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claim liability at December 31, 2010. As summarized below, Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, provides historical information regarding the accrual and payment of our medical claims liability. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year.” Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. We believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for unpaid claims liability at each reporting date. 75 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 is as follows: Years Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Gross medical claims payable, beginning of period $ 5,450.5 $ 6,184.7 $ 5,788.0 Ceded medical claims payable, beginning of period (29.9 ) (60.3 ) (60.7 ) Net medical claims payable, beginning of period 5,420.6 6,124.4 5,727.3 Business combinations and purchase adjustments — 2.8 — Net incurred medical claims: Current year 45,077.1 47,315.1 47,940.9 Prior years redundancies (718.0 ) (807.2 ) (263.2 ) Total net incurred medical claims 44,359.1 46,507.9 47,677.7 Net payments attributable to: Current year medical claims 40,387.8 42,056.9 42,020.7 Prior years medical claims 4,572.4 5,157.6 5,259.9 Total net payments 44,960.2 47,214.5 47,280.6 Net medical claims payable, end of period 4,819.5 5,420.6 6,124.4 Ceded medical claims payable, end of period 32.9 29.9 60.3 Gross medical claims payable, end of period $ 4,852.4 $ 5,450.5 $ 6,184.7 Current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net incurred medical claims 89.6 % 88.9 % 87.7 % Prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net medical claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current period 15.3 % 15.2 % 4.8 % Prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims 1.5 % 1.7 % 0.6 % Amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled. Liabilities at any period end are continually reviewed and re-estimated as information regarding actual claims payments, or runout, becomes known. This information is compared to the originally established year end liability. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated. The prior year redundancy of $718.0 million shown above for the year ended December 31, 2010 represents an estimate based on paid claim activity from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010. Medical claim liabilities are usually described as having a “short tail,” which means that they are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the majority of the $718.0 million redundancy relates to claims incurred in calendar year 2009. 76 Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of the completion and trend factor assumptions, which had the most significant impact on the actual development of our incurred but not paid claims liability estimates for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by other operational variables, including system changes, provider submission patterns and business combinations. Favorable (Unfavorable) Developments byChanges in Key Assumptions 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Assumed trend factors $ 534.9 $ 466.1 $ 383.5 Assumed completion factors 183.1 341.1 (120.3 ) Total $ 718.0 $ 807.2 $ 263.2 The favorable development recognized in 2010 resulted primarily from trend factors in late 2009 developing more favorably than originally expected. In addition, a minor but steady improvement in payment cycle times impacted completion factor development and contributed to the favorability. The favorable development recognized in 2009 was driven by significant contributions from both trend and completion factor development. Trend factors in late 2008 restated more favorably than originally expected. Further, a large reduction in payment cycle times also impacted completion factor development and contributed to the favorability. The favorable development in 2008 was less significant. Trend factors in late 2008 developed more favorably than expected. Offsetting a portion of this impact was unfavorability created by completion factor development, which was driven by claim processing patterns developing differently than expected. Due to changes within our Company and industry during 2010, we re-evaluated our actuarial processes and resulting levels of reserves. As discussed in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Actuarial Standards of Practice require that claims liabilities be appropriate under moderately adverse circumstances. To satisfy these requirements, our reserving process has historically involved recognizing the inherent volatility in actual future claim payments compared to the current estimate for the related liability by recording a provision for adverse deviation. This additional reserve establishes a sufficient level of conservatism in the liability estimate that is similar from period to period. There are a number of factors that can require a higher or lower level of additional reserve, such as changes in technology that provide faster access to claims data or change the speed of adjudication and settlement of claims, or overall variability in claim payment patterns and claim inventory levels. Given that in the more recent periods we experienced higher levels of automatic claims adjudication and faster claims payment leading to lower and more consistent claims inventory levels, we determined that using a lower level of targeted reserve for adverse deviation provides a similar level of confidence that the established reserves are appropriate in the current environment. This change in estimate resulted in a benefit to 2010 income before income tax expense and diluted earnings per share of $67.7 million and $0.11, respectively. This benefit is considered a release of current year reserves and, accordingly, is not included as part of the release of prior year reserves that were not reestablished in 2010 as disclosed earlier in this “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Medical Claims Payable” section. We expect to use this lower level of targeted reserve for adverse deviation in future periods unless changing circumstances require us to revise this estimate. The ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 89.6% for 2010, 88.9% for 2009 and 87.7% for 2008. Comparison of these ratios reflects acceleration in processing that has occurred. We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current period in order to demonstrate the 77 Table of Contents development of the prior year reserves. This metric was 15.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 15.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The 10 basis point increase over the two periods resulted primarily from restated claims trends differing more significantly from the original assumptions used in the most recent year compared to the prior year. This metric was 4.8% for 2008, reflecting the lower level of prior year redundancies as discussed above. We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation indicates the reasonableness of our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims and the consistency of our methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2010, this metric was 1.5%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $718.0 million shown above. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the comparable metric was 1.7%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $807.2 million shown above and represents an estimate based on paid medical claims activity from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009. This metric was 0.6% for 2008, reflecting the lower level of prior year redundancies as discussed above. The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in the above table for each of 2009 and 2008 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims—current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims—prior years redundancies” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 2009 2008 (In millions) Total net incurred medical claims, as reported $ 46,507.9 $ 47,677.7 Retrospective basis, as described above 46,597.1 47,133.7 Variance $ (89.2 ) $ 544.0 Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported (0.2 )% 1.1 % Given that our business is primarily short tailed, the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2010 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2011. The 2009 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of (0.2)% is lower than the 2008 percentage of 1.1%. The 2009 variance was driven by fairly consistent levels of prior year reserve redundancies over the past two years as reported in 2009 and 2010 on 2008 and 2009 experience, respectively. The 2008 percentage was driven by an increase in prior year reserve redundancies reported in 2009 compared to 2008 on 2008 and 2007 experience, respectively. The 2008 reported redundancy was lower than the 2009 reported redundancy. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with FASB guidance, which requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance. 78 Table of Contents At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following: • the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset; • the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim; • the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and • any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences. We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits, as required by the guidance. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted. In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intend to defend our positions vigorously through the federal, state and local appeals processes. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact on our results of operations from these matters. As of December 31, 2010, the examinations of our 2009 through 2004 tax years continue to be in process. In addition, there are several years with ongoing disputes related to pre-acquisition companies that continue to be in process. Many of the issues in open tax years have been resolved; however, several of the examinations still require approval from the Joint Committee on Taxation before they can be finalized. The years under audit are in part interdependent on the settlement of the pre-acquisition audits, some of which require the approval of the Joint Committee on Taxation, impacting the ultimate conclusion of all the examinations. We are a member of the IRS Compliance Assurance Process, or CAP. The objective of CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the IRS of the accuracy of tax returns prior to filing, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations. Administrative tax appeals and proceedings also continue for certain subsidiaries for tax years prior to being included in our consolidated tax return. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we completed the sale of our PBM business and recorded tax expense of $1.4 billion related to this sale. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we settled disputes with the IRS relating to certain tax years and involving industry issues which we had been discussing with the IRS for several years. For certain years, tax positions have been resolved but the overall tax year may require additional approval from the Joint Committee on Taxation before it can be finalized in total. In addition, tax litigation in the U.S. Tax Court concluded adversely to us during 2008. This adverse decision was appealed. In March, 2010 the Court of Appeals in the Seventh Circuit issued a decision ruling that various payments made to several states in prior years should be recognized as deferred tax assets and not a current tax deduction for the year being litigated. The Company is in discussions with the IRS as to the appropriate treatment of the deferred tax assets. While it is difficult to determine when a tax settlement will actually occur, it is reasonably possible that one could occur in the next twelve months and our unrecognized tax benefits could change within a range of approximately $(45.0) million to $5.0 million. For additional information, see Note 8, “Income Taxes,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, included in this Form 10-K. 79 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2010 was $13.3 billion and other intangible assets were $8.0 billion. The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets represented 42% of our total consolidated assets and 89% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2010. We follow FASB guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, which include goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately. We completed our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarters of 2010, 2009 and 2008. These tests involved the use of estimates related to the fair value of the goodwill reporting unit and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and required a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Certain interim impairment tests were performed in 2010, 2009 and 2008 due to changes in our business. As a result of our annual and interim impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets during 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets of $21.1 million, $262.5 million and $141.4 million, respectively. Fair value is estimated using the income and market approaches for our goodwill reporting units and the income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. Use of the income and market approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. The income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. These estimated future cash flows are then discounted. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted average cost of capital. The discount rate used in the 2010 and 2009 valuations included an increase to account for the uncertainty related to health care reform. Market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including membership, revenue, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and book value as well as market capitalization analysis of WellPoint and other comparable companies. While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income. For additional information, see Note 10, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, included in this Form 10-K. 80 Table of Contents Investments Current and long-term available-for-sale investment securities were $17.6 billion at December 31, 2010 and represented 35% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2010. We classify fixed maturity and equity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” or “trading” and report those securities at fair value. Certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity. Investment income is recorded when earned, and realized gains or losses, determined by specific identification of investments sold, are included in income when securities are sold. We review investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. In addition, for equity securities, we determine whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time to allow for a recovery of its fair value above its carrying amount. If any declines of equity securities are determined to be other-than-temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made. Certain Financial Accounting Standards Board other-than-temporary impairment, or FASB OTTI, guidance applies to fixed maturity securities and provides guidance on the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments. In addition, this FASB OTTI guidance requires additional disclosures related to other-than-temporary impairments. If a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and is recorded to other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income in our consolidated income statements. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, the credit component of the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income in our consolidated income statements and the non-credit component of the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in other comprehensive income. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by interest rate and other non-credit factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The credit component of an other-than temporary impairment is determined by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of acquisition. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other debt securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings, and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default. Upon adoption of the FASB OTTI guidance on April 1, 2009, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment, net of taxes, of $88.9 million as of the beginning of the period of adoption, April 1, 2009, to reclassify the non-credit component of a previously recognized other-than-temporary impairment from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income. 81 Table of Contents The unrealized gains or losses on our equity and fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. We have a committee of certain accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. The current economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income totaled $39.4 million, $450.2 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. There were no individually significant other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments by issuer during the years ended December 31, 2010 or 2009. The significant other-than-temporary impairments recognized during 2008 primarily related to our investments in Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Lehman (or their respective subsidiaries, as appropriate), as discussed below. Market concerns during the third quarter of 2008 related to Freddie Mac’s and Fannie Mae’s financial condition and liquidity prompted the U.S. government to seize control of those entities. Any potential recovery of the fair value of these securities was dependent on a number of factors and was not expected in the near term. These facts, together with the significant declines in the fair value of these securities, led us to conclude that they were other-than-temporarily impaired. Accordingly, during 2008, we recorded $135.0 million and $106.6 million of realized losses from other-than-temporary impairments related to our equity security investments in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, respectively. In addition, on September 15, 2008, Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, recovery of our investments, if any, was deemed remote and we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment of $90.2 million during 2008. In addition, other-than-temporary impairments recognized in 2008 included charges for fixed maturity securities and equity securities for which, due to credit downgrades and/or the extent and duration of their decline in fair value in light of the then current market conditions, we determined that the impairment was deemed other-than-temporary. These securities covered a number of industries, led by the banking and financial services sectors. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $142.5 million of gross unrealized losses on investments recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, $134.7 million of which related to fixed maturity securities and $7.8 million of which related to equity securities. We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. This could result in other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments being charged against future income. Given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional, material other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments may be recorded in future periods. A primary objective in the management of fixed maturity and equity portfolios is to maximize total return relative to underlying liabilities and respective liquidity needs. In achieving this goal, assets may be sold to take advantage of market conditions or other investment opportunities as well as tax considerations. Sales will generally produce realized gains and losses. In the ordinary course of business, we may sell securities at a loss for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the investment environment; (ii) expectations that the fair value could deteriorate further; (iii) desire to reduce exposure to an issuer or an industry; (iv) changes in credit quality; or (v) changes in expected cash flow. We maintain various rabbi trusts to account for the assets and liabilities under certain deferred compensation plans. Under these deferred compensation plans, the participants can defer certain types of compensation and elect to receive a return on the deferred amounts based on the changes in fair value of various investment options, primarily a variety of mutual funds. We also generally purchase corporate-owned life insurance policies on 82 Table of Contents participants in the deferred compensation plans. The cash surrender value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies is reported in “Other invested assets, long-term” in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in cash surrender value is reported as an offset to the premium expense of the policies, classified as general and administrative expenses. In addition to available-for-sale investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $865.4 million, or 2% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2010. These long-term investments consist primarily of real estate, cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and certain other investments. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term. We participate in securities lending programs whereby marketable securities in our investment portfolio are transferred to independent brokers or dealers based on, among other things, their creditworthiness in exchange for cash collateral initially equal to at least 102% of the value of the securities on loan and is thereafter maintained at a minimum of 100% of the market value of the securities loaned (calculated as the ratio of initial cash collateral to current market value of the securities on loan). Accordingly, the market value of the securities on loan to each borrower is monitored daily and the borrower is required to deliver additional cash collateral if the market value of the securities on loan exceeds the initial cash collateral delivered. We recognize the collateral as an asset, which is reported as “securities lending collateral” on our consolidated balance sheets and we record a corresponding liability for the obligation to return the collateral to the borrower, which is reported as “securities lending payable.” The securities on loan are reported in the applicable investment category on the consolidated balance sheets. Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage the market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits of investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future earnings and financial position. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $16.3 billion at December 31, 2010. The weighted-average credit rating of these securities was “A” as of December 31, 2010. Included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities and corporate securities of $2.2 billion, $24.8 million and $42.2 million, respectively, that are guaranteed by third parties. With the exception of eleven securities with a fair value of $20.6 million, these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2010 with a guarantee by a third party. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities without the guarantee was “AA” as of December 31, 2010 for the securities for which such information is available. At December 31, 2010, we owned $3.2 billion of mortgage-backed securities and $264.5 million of asset-backed securities out of a total available-for-sale investment portfolio of $17.6 billion. These securities included sub-prime and Alt-A securities with fair values of $78.6 million and $244.7 million, respectively. These sub-prime and Alt-A securities had net unrealized losses of $5.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively. The average credit rating of the sub-prime and Alt-A securities was “BBB” and “B,” respectively. Fair values of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with FASB guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. We obtain only one quoted price for each security from third party pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. For securities not actively traded, the third party pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are 83 Table of Contents often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform monthly analysis on the prices received from third parties to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes a review of month to month price fluctuations. If unusual fluctuations are noted in this review, we may obtain additional information from other pricing services to validate the quoted price. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from third party pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 that were material to the consolidated financial statements. In certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. Such securities are designated Level III in accordance with FASB guidance. Securities designated Level III at December 31, 2010 totaled $388.7 million and represented 2% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level III securities primarily consist of certain inverse floating rate securities, structured securities and municipal bonds that were thinly traded or not traded at all due to concerns in the securities markets and the resulting lack of liquidity. Consequently, observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using internal estimates for inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” in this Form 10-K, and Notes 5, “Investments,” and 7, “Fair Value,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, included in this Form 10-K. Retirement Benefits Pension Benefits We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for some of our employees. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FASB guidance for retirement benefits, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by the guidance, we calculate the value of plan assets as described below. Further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods. An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our December 31, 2010 measurement date, we selected a long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00% for all plans, which is consistent with our prior year assumption of 8.00%. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and an average of historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase. This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date (December 31, 2010). The selected discount rate for 84 Table of Contents all plans is 5.15%, which was developed using a yield curve approach. Using yields available on high-quality fixed maturity securities with various maturity dates, the yield curve approach provides a “customized” rate, which is meant to match the expected cash flows of our specific benefit plans. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with the guidance. In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities, equity securities and alternative investments across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow. The target allocation for pension benefit plan assets is 44% equity securities, 45% fixed maturity securities, and 11% to all other types of investments. No plan assets were invested in WellPoint common stock as of the measurement date. For the year ended December 31, 2010, no material contributions were required to meet the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, minimum required funding levels; however, we may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. Contributions of $3.9 million were made to certain supplemental plans during the year ended December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010 our consolidated net pension assets were $27.3 million, including liabilities of $66.0 million for certain supplemental plans. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recognized consolidated pretax pension cost (credit) of $22.2 million, $(27.8) million, and $(27.0) million, respectively. Other Postretirement Benefits We provide most associates with certain medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions including a discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits. We recognized a postretirement benefit liability of $388.2 million at December 31, 2010. We recognized consolidated pre-tax other postretirement cost of $30.1 million, $33.8 million, and $30.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At our December 31, 2010 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 5.24% (compared to a discount rate of 5.79% for 2010 expense recognition). We developed this rate using a yield curve approach as described above. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of other benefits at our December 31, 2010 measurement dates was 8.00% for 2011 with a gradual decline to 5.00% by the year 2017. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2010 by $49.7 million and would increase service and interest costs by $2.7 million. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by $42.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and would decrease service and interest costs by $2.3 million. We made tax deductible discretionary contributions totaling $135.0 million to the other postretirement benefit plans during the year ended December 31, 2010. For additional information regarding retirement benefits, see Note 11, “Retirement Benefits,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, included in this Form 10-K. 85 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2010-06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, or ASU 2010-06. ASU 2010-06 amends ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, to require a number of additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Effective January 1, 2010, ASU 2010-06 requires disclosure of the amounts of significant transfers between Level I and Level II and the reasons for such transfers, the reasons for any transfers in or out of Level III, and disclosure of the policy for determining when transfers between levels are recognized. ASU 2010-06 also clarified that disclosures should be provided for each class of assets and liabilities and clarified the requirement to disclose information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating Level II and Level III measurements. Beginning January 1, 2011, ASU 2010-06 also requires that information in the reconciliation of recurring Level III measurements about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements be provided on a gross basis. The adoption of ASU 2010-06 only required additional disclosures and did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. There were no other new accounting pronouncements issued during the year ended December 31, 2010 that had a material impact on our financial position, operating results or disclosures. X. Liquidity and Capital Resources Introduction Our cash receipts result primarily from premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, capital expenditures and repurchases of our common stock. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have some negative impact on our liquidity. We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy. A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities, to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. The securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility, although current market conditions are more stable. During the past two years, the Federal government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to restore liquidity in the financial markets and to help relieve the credit crisis and strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. In addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide liquidity and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions. 86 Table of Contents We have a $2.5 billion commercial paper program. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we intend to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our $2.0 billion senior credit facility to redeem our commercial paper when it matures. While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we believe the lenders participating in our credit facility will be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. In addition to the $2.0 billion senior credit facility, we expect to receive approximately $2.2 billion of ordinary dividends from our subsidiaries during 2011, which also provides further operating and financial flexibility. The table below outlines the cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: Years Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,416.7 $ 3,038.9 $ 2,535.4 Investing activities (1,271.5 ) 3,002.8 616.2 Financing activities (3,169.3 ) (3,402.8 ) (3,735.6 ) Effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (3.2 ) (6.7 ) — (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,027.3 ) $ 2,632.2 $ (584.0 ) Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 During the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion, compared to cash flow provided by operating activities of $3.0 billion for year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $1.6 billion. This decrease resulted primarily from tax payments of $1.2 billion to the IRS, related to the gain we realized on the 2009 sale of our PBM business and increased incentive compensation payments in 2010. Net cash flow used in investing activities was $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to cash flow provided by investing activities of $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in cash flow used in investing activities of $4.3 billion between the two periods primarily resulted from the cash proceeds from the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts in 2009 and increases in securities lending collateral, increases in net purchases of property and equipment and increases in other investing activities, partially offset by decreases in net purchases of investments and decreases in purchases of subsidiaries. Net cash flow used in financing activities was $3.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $3.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in cash flow used in financing activities of $233.5 million primarily resulted from increases in the net proceeds from debt issuances, increases in securities lending payables, decreases in bank overdrafts and increases in cash proceeds from employee stock plans, partially offset by increases in the repurchase of common stock. We completed $4.4 billion of share repurchases in 2010, representing a significant return of capital to our shareholders following the 2009 sale of our PBM business. Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 During 2009, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $3.0 billion, compared to $2.5 billion in 2008, an increase of $0.5 billion. This increase in operating cash flow compared to 2008 was driven primarily by the favorable net change in provider advances, decreased tax payments, lower experience-rated refunds to certain large customers and decreased incentive compensation payments. These favorable operating cash flow drivers were partially offset by unfavorable operating cash flows related to the transition of the PBM business to Express Scripts, higher discretionary benefit plan contributions and the delay in receipt of certain State-Sponsored business premiums until early 2010. 87 Table of Contents Net cash flow provided by investing activities was $3.0 billion in 2009, compared to $616.2 million in 2008. The increase in cash flow provided by investing activities of $2.4 billion from 2008 primarily resulted from the cash proceeds from the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts and decreases in purchases of subsidiaries, partially offset by increases in net purchases of investments, decreases in securities lending collateral and increases in net purchases of property and equipment. Net cash flow used in financing activities was $3.4 billion in 2009 compared to $3.7 billion in 2008. The decrease in cash flow used in financing activities of $332.8 million primarily resulted from decreases in the repurchase of common stock and decreases in securities lending payable, partially offset by increases in the net repayments of borrowings and an increase in bank overdrafts. Financial Condition We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, of $20.2 billion at December 31, 2010. Since December 31, 2009, total cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, decreased by $2.4 billion primarily due to tax payments of $1.2 billion to the IRS, related to the gain we realized on the 2009 sale of our PBM business, which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2009, and an increase in the repurchase of common stock of $1.7 billion over 2009 common stock repurchases. Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. In addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2010, we held at the parent company approximately $3.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and investments, which is available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, share and debt repurchases and interest payments. We calculate a non-GAAP measure, our consolidated debt-to-total capital ratio, which we believe assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. In addition, our bank covenants indicate a maximum debt-to-total capital ratio that we cannot exceed. Our targeted range of debt-to-total capital ratio is 25% to 35%. Our debt-to-total capital ratio is calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt plus shareholders’ equity. Our debt-to-total capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our consolidated debt-to-total capital ratio was 27.3% as of December 31, 2010 and 25.3% as of December 31, 2009. Our senior debt is rated “A-” by Standard & Poor’s, “A-” by Fitch, Inc., “Baa1” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. A significant downgrade in our debt ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs. Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity On December 12, 2008, we filed an updated shelf registration statement with the SEC to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt, capitalization of our subsidiaries, repurchases of our common stock or the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion. At maturity on January 15, 2011, we repaid the $700.0 million outstanding balance of our 5.000% senior unsecured notes. 88 Table of Contents On September 30, 2010, we entered into a senior credit facility, or the facility, with certain lenders for general corporate purposes. The facility provides credit up to $2.0 billion and matures on September 30, 2013. The interest rate on the facility is based on either, (i) the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined percentage rate based on our credit rating at the date of utilization, or (ii) a base rate as defined in the facility agreement plus a predetermined percentage rate based on our credit rating at the date of utilization. Our ability to borrow under the facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. Commitment and legal fees paid for the facility were $7.6 million and there are no conditions that are probable of occurring under which the facility may be withdrawn. There were no amounts outstanding under the facility as of or during the three months ended December 31, 2010, or under a previous facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2010. At December 31, 2010, we had $2.0 billion available under the facility. This facility replaced our previous senior credit facility, which provided credit up to $2.4 billion. On August 12, 2010, we issued $700.0 million of 4.350% notes due 2020 and $300.0 million of 5.800% notes due 2040 under our shelf registration statement. We used the proceeds from this debt issuance to repay the remaining outstanding balance of our variable rate senior term loan and for general corporate purposes. The notes have a call feature that allows us to repurchase the notes at any time at our option and a put feature that allows a note holder to require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of both a change of control event and a downgrade of the notes. We have received notification from the IRS that it has proposed certain adjustments to our prior year tax returns currently being audited. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intend to defend our positions vigorously through the appeals process. However, if we are not able to prevail, we will be required to make additional tax payments. While this will not impact our future results of operations, it could reduce future operating cash flow. We are a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, collectively, the FHLBs, and as a member we have the ability to obtain cash advances subject to certain requirements. In order to obtain cash advances, we are required to pledge securities as collateral to the FHLBs, initially equal to a certain percentage of the cash borrowings, depending on the type of securities pledged as collateral. The market value of the collateral is monitored daily by the FHLBs, and if it falls below the required percentage of the cash borrowings, we are required to pledge additional securities as collateral or repay a portion of the outstanding cash advance balance. In addition, our borrowings may be limited based on the amount of our investment in the FHLBs’ common stock. Our investment in the FHLBs’ common stock at December 31, 2010 totaled $11.4 million, which is reported in “Investments available-for-sale—Equity securities” on the consolidated balance sheets. On December 21, 2010, we borrowed $100.0 million from the FHLBs with a one-month term at a fixed interest rate of 0.120%, which was outstanding at December 31, 2010 and was repaid on January 18, 2011. On January 18, 2011, we borrowed another $100.0 million for a two-month period at 0.200%, with a maturity date of March 21, 2011. In addition, on April 12, 2010, we borrowed $100.0 million from the FHLBs with a two-year term at a fixed interest rate of 1.430%, which is reported with “Long-term debt, less current portion” on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities, primarily certain U.S. government sponsored mortgage-backed securities, with a fair value of $237.9 million at December 31, 2010 have been pledged as collateral. The securities pledged are reported in “Investments available-for-sale—Fixed maturity securities” on the consolidated balance sheets. We have our Board of Directors’ approval to borrow up to $2.5 billion under our commercial paper program. Proceeds from any issuance of commercial paper may be used for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of our debt and common stock. Commercial paper notes are short-term senior unsecured notes, with a maturity not to exceed 270 days from date of issuance. When issued, the notes bear interest at the then current market rates. We had $336.2 million of borrowings outstanding under this commercial paper program as of December 31, 2010. We continue to classify our commercial paper as long-term debt given our intent to issue commercial paper or our ability to redeem our commercial paper using our $2.0 billion senior credit facility. 89 Table of Contents As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we are currently estimating approximately $2.2 billion of ordinary dividends to be paid to the parent company during 2011. During 2010, we received $2.7 billion of dividends from our subsidiaries. We regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Historically, our common stock repurchase program, discussed below, has been our primary use of capital, and we have not previously paid any cash dividends on our common stock through December 31, 2010. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. The repurchases are effected from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase agreements, and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, as amended. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we repurchased and retired approximately 76.7 million shares at an average per share price of $56.86, for an aggregate cost of $4.4 billion. On January 26, October 29 and December 9, 2010, our Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by $3.5 billion, $500.0 million and $125.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, $148.5 million remained authorized for future repurchases. On February 3, 2011, our Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by $375.0 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2010, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $162.7 million, leaving approximately $360.8 million for authorized future repurchases at February 9, 2011. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares when we believe it is a prudent use of capital. Our current retirement benefits funding strategy is to fund an amount at least equal to the minimum required funding as determined under ERISA with consideration of maximum tax deductible amounts. We may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2010, no contributions were required to meet ERISA required funding levels; however, we made tax deductible discretionary contributions totaling $138.9 million to our benefit plans during the year ended December 31, 2010. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010 are as follows: Total Payments Due by Period Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 Years (In millions) Debt, including capital leases1 $ 14,512.1 $ 1,275.3 $ 2,446.7 $ 1,629.8 $ 9,160.3 Operating lease commitments 683.6 119.4 189.9 159.8 214.5 Projected other postretirement benefits 589.7 42.6 140.7 146.8 259.6 Purchase obligations: IBM outsourcing agreements2 1,022.7 238.3 491.5 292.9 — Other purchase obligations3 1,720.1 843.1 632.6 226.7 17.7 Other long-term liabilities4 895.3 — 349.7 344.0 201.6 Venture capital commitments 225.8 87.3 105.5 33.0 — Total contractual obligations and commitments $ 19,649.3 $ 2,606.0 $ 4,356.6 $ 2,833.0 $ 9,853.7 1 Includes estimated interest expense. 90 Table of Contents 2 Relates to agreements with International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, to provide information technology infrastructure services. See Note 14, “Commitments and Contingences,” to the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 included in this Form 10-K for further information. 3 Includes obligations related to non-IBM information technology service agreements and telecommunication contracts. 4 Estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from this table as we had no funding requirements under ERISA at December 31, 2010, as a result of the value of the assets in the plans. On December 1, 2009, we entered into a ten-year agreement with Express Scripts to provide pharmacy benefit management services for our plans. Under this agreement, Express Scripts will be the exclusive provider of certain specified pharmacy benefit management services, such as pharmacy network management, home delivery, pharmacy customer service, claims processing, rebate management, drug utilization and specialty pharmaceutical management services. Accordingly, the agreement contains certain financial and operational requirements obligating both Express Scripts and us. Express Scripts’ primary obligations relate to the performance of such services and meeting certain pricing guarantees and performance standards. Our primary obligations relate to oversight, provision of data, payment for services, transition services and certain minimum script volume requirements. The failure by either party to meet the respective requirements could potentially serve as a basis for early termination of the contract. In addition, our failure to meet the minimum script volume requirements may result in financial penalties that could have a material impact on our results of operations. The above table does not contain any potential amounts related to this agreement. The above table does not contain $125.2 million of gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions and interest for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities. See Note 8, “Income Taxes,” to the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 included in this Form 10-K for further information. In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our senior credit facility or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions. For additional information on our debt and lease commitments, see Notes 13, “Debt,” and 18, “Leases,” respectively, to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, included in this Form 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that will require funding in future periods. Risk-Based Capital Our regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies largely based on the NAIC’s RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under this Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar 91 Table of Contents year. Our risk-based capital as of December 31, 2010, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, was in excess of all mandatory RBC thresholds. In addition to exceeding the RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries. XI. Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 This document contains certain forward-looking information about us that is intended to be covered by the safe harbor for “forward-looking statements” provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures in our SEC reports. 92 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2010. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return. Investments Our investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk. The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit downgrade to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that downgrade. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately “A.” Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which represent an exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value. Our portfolio includes corporate securities (approximately 44% of the total fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2010), which are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. This risk is managed through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately “BBB.” Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systemic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 93% of our available-for-sale investments were fixed maturity securities. Market risk is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $732.4 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $741.5 million increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly. Our available-for-sale equity securities portfolio, as of December 31, 2010, was approximately 7% of our investments. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $127.0 million. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $127.0 million. 93 Table of Contents Long-Term Debt Our total long-term debt at December 31, 2010 was $8.9 billion, and included $336.2 million of commercial paper and $100.0 million outstanding on a Federal Home Loan Bank loan. The carrying values of the commercial paper approximate fair value as the underlying instruments have variable interest rates at market value. The carrying value of the Federal Home Loan Bank loan approximates fair value due to the relatively short-nature of the note and its collateralization. The remainder of the debt is subject to interest rate risk as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2010, we had $8.4 billion of senior unsecured notes with fixed interest rates. These notes, at par value, included $700.0 million at 5.000% due 2011, $350.0 million at 6.375% due 2012, $800.0 million at 6.80% due 2012, $500.0 million at 5.00% due 2014, $400.0 million at 6.00% due 2014, $1,100.0 million at 5.250% due 2016, $700.0 million at 5.875% due 2017, $600.0 million at 7.000% due 2019, $700.0 million at 4.350% due 2020, $500.0 million at 5.950% due 2034, $900.0 million at 5.850% due 2036, $800.0 million at 6.375% due 2037 and $300.0 million at 5.800% due 2040. These notes had combined carrying and estimated fair value of $8.4 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Our subordinated debt includes surplus notes issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries. Par value of amounts outstanding at December 31, 2010 included $25.1 million of 9.000% surplus notes due 2027. Any payment of interest or principal on the surplus notes may be made only with the prior approval of the Indiana Department of Insurance. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the surplus notes were $24.9 million and $35.6 million at December 31, 2010. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. Derivatives We have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts, which are used to lock-in interest rates or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. We have used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities. Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these derivatives. As of December 31, 2010, we recorded an asset of $95.3 million, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swap’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $27.1 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $27.1 million increase in fair value. We also utilize put and call options on the S&P 500 index to hedge (on an economic basis) the exposure of our equity security portfolio to fluctuations in the equity markets. While the impact of fluctuations in the equity markets on these derivatives are largely offset by changes in the fair values of our equity security portfolio, the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized immediately in our income statement, whereas the change in fair value of our equity securities is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Accordingly, a decrease in the S&P 500 index of 10% would result in an approximate increase of $33.0 million in the fair value of these derivatives. An increase in the S&P 500 index of 10% would result in an approximate decrease of $22.9 million in the fair value of these derivatives. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Investments” section for accounting related to securities in our equity portfolio. 94 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:53:20.342169
1156039,ELV,"Elevance Health, Inc.",2012,"Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Form 10-K. Our results of operations depend in large part on accurately predicting health care costs and our ability to manage future health care costs through adequate product pricing, medical management, product design and negotiation of favorable provider contracts. The aging of the population and other demographic characteristics and advances in medical technology continue to contribute to rising health care costs. Our managed care plans and products are designed to encourage providers and members to participate in quality, cost-effective health benefit programs by using the full range of our innovative medical management services, quality initiatives and financial incentives. Our leading market share and high business retention rates enable us to realize the long-term benefits of investing in preventive and early detection programs. Our ability to provide cost-effective health benefits products and services is enhanced through a disciplined approach to internal cost containment, prudent management of our risk exposure and successful integration of acquired businesses. In addition, our ability to manage selling, general and administrative costs continues to be an increasing driver of our overall profitability. Our future results of operations will also be impacted by certain external forces and resulting changes in our business model and strategy. In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed and the President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, as well as the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or HCERA, or collectively, Health Care Reform, which represents significant changes to the current U.S. health care system. The legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage over time by increasing the eligibility thresholds for most state Medicaid programs and providing certain other individuals and small businesses with tax credits to subsidize a portion of the cost of health insurance coverage. As a result of the complexity of the law, its impacts on health care in the United States and the continuing modification and interpretation of Health Care Reform’s rules, we cannot currently estimate the ultimate impact of Health Care Reform on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. For additional discussion, see “Regulation,” herein and Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. In addition to the external forces discussed in the preceding paragraph, our results of operations are impacted by levels and mix of membership. Since 2008, we experienced membership declines due to unfavorable economic conditions driving increased unemployment. During 2011, this trend reversed and our overall 5 Table of Contents membership increased. However, we expect unemployment levels will remain high throughout 2012, which will likely impact our ability to maintain current membership levels. In addition, we believe the self-insured portion of our group membership base will continue to increase as a percentage of total group membership. These membership trends could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Form 10-K. We continue to believe health care is local and feel that we have the strong local presence required to understand and meet local customer needs. We believe we are well-positioned to deliver what customers want: innovative, choice-based and affordable products; distinctive service; simplified transactions; and better access to information for quality care. Our local presence, combined with our national expertise, have created opportunities for collaborative programs that reward physicians and hospitals for clinical quality and excellence. We feel that our commitment to health improvement and care management provides added value to customers and health care professionals. We believe that an essential ingredient for practical and sustainable improvements in health care is raising health care quality while managing costs for total cost affordability. We have identified solutions that we believe will deliver better health care while reducing costs. These include driving innovation in paying and partnering with providers to compel improved cost, quality and health along with finding new, effective ways to manage risk and engage the member as a consumer. In addition, we seek to achieve efficiencies from our national scale while optimizing service performance for our customers. Finally, we seek to continue to rationalize our portfolio of businesses and products, and align our investments to capitalize on new opportunities to drive growth in both our existing and new markets in the future. We continue to enhance interactions with customers, brokers, agents, employees and other stakeholders through web-enabled technology and improving internal operations. Our approach includes not only sales and distribution of health benefits products on the Internet, but also implementation of advanced capabilities that improve service benefiting customers, agents, brokers, and providers while optimizing administrative costs. These enhancements will also help improve the quality, coordination and safety of health care through increased communications between patients and their physicians. We intend to continue pursuing our mission to improve the lives of the people we serve and the health of our communities, while driving growth in both existing and new markets, including expansion of the CareMore operating model. At the same time, we will focus on earnings per share, or EPS, growth through organic membership gains, improvements in our operating cost structure, strategic acquisitions and efficient use of capital. Significant Events The more significant events that have occurred over the last five years that have impacted or will impact our capital structure or that have or will influence how we conduct our business operations include: • Use of Capital—Board of Directors declaration of dividends on common stock (2011) and authorization for repurchases of our common stock (2011 and prior) • Acquisition of CareMore, as previously described (2011) • Sale of our pharmacy benefits management, or PBM, business to Express Scripts, Inc., or Express Scripts (2009) • Acquisition of DeCare Dental, LLC, or DeCare (2009) • Acquisition of Imaging Management Holdings, LLC, and subsidiary, American Imaging Management, Inc., or AIM (2007) For additional information regarding these events, see Note 3, “Business Combinations and Divestitures,” and Note 15, “Capital Stock,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011, included in this Form 10-K. 6 Table of Contents Competition The managed care industry is highly competitive, both nationally and in our regional markets. Competition continues to be intense due to aggressive marketing, business consolidations, a proliferation of new products and increased quality awareness and price sensitivity among customers. Health benefits industry participants compete for customers mainly on the following factors: • quality of service; • access to provider networks; • access to care management and wellness programs, including health information; • innovation, breadth and flexibility of products and benefits; • reputation (including National Committee on Quality Assurance, or NCQA, accreditation status); • brand recognition; • price; and • financial stability. Over the last few years, a health plan’s ability to interact with employers, members and other third parties (including health care professionals) via the Internet has become a more important competitive factor and we have made significant investments in technology to enhance our electronic interaction with providers, employers, members and third parties. We believe our exclusive right to market products under the most recognized brand in the industry, BCBS, in our most significant markets provides us with an advantage over our competition. Our provider networks in our markets enable us to achieve cost-efficiencies and distinctive service levels enabling us to offer a broad range of health benefits to our customers on a more cost-effective basis than many of our competitors. We strive to distinguish our products through provider access, service, care management, product value and brand recognition. To build our provider networks, we compete with other health benefits plans for the best contracts with hospitals, physicians and other providers. We believe that physicians and other providers primarily consider member volume, reimbursement rates, timeliness of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities along with the reduction of non-value added administrative tasks when deciding whether to contract with a health benefits plan. At the sales and distribution level, we compete for qualified agents and brokers to recommend and distribute our products. Strong competition exists among insurance companies and health benefits plans for agents and brokers with demonstrated ability to secure new business and maintain existing accounts. We believe that quality and price of our products, support services, reputation and prior relationships, along with a reasonable commission structure are the factors agents and brokers consider in choosing whether to market our products. We believe that we have good relationships with our agents and brokers, and that our products, support services and commission structure compare favorably to our competitors in all of our markets. Typically we are the lead competitor in each of our markets and, thus, are a closely watched target by other insurance competitors. Reportable Segments We manage our operations through three reportable segments: Commercial, Consumer, and Other. Our Commercial and Consumer segments both offer a diversified mix of managed care products, including PPOs, HMOs, traditional indemnity benefits and POS plans, as well as a variety of hybrid benefit plans including CDHPs, hospital only and limited benefit products. 7 Table of Contents Our Commercial segment includes Local Group (including UniCare), National Accounts and certain other ancillary business operations (dental, vision, life and disability and workers’ compensation). Business units in the Commercial segment offer fully-insured products and provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers, including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management, disease management, wellness programs and other administrative services. Our Consumer segment includes Senior, State-Sponsored and Individual businesses. Our Senior business includes services such as Medicare Advantage (including private fee-for-service plans and special needs plans), Medicare Part D, and Medicare Supplement, while our State-Sponsored business includes our managed care alternatives for Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Plan programs. Individual business includes individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. Our Other segment includes the Comprehensive Health Solutions business unit, or CHS, that brings together our resources focused on optimizing the quality of health care, the clinical consumer experience and cost of care management. CHS included our PBM business until its sale to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009, and also includes provider relations, care and disease management, employee assistance programs, including behavioral health, radiology benefit management and analytics-driven, evidence based personal health care guidance. Our Other segment also includes results from our Federal Government Solutions, or FGS, business. FGS business includes FEP and National Government Services, Inc., or NGS, which acts as a Medicare contractor in several regions across the nation. The Other segment also includes other businesses that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, guidance for disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information, as well as intersegment sales and expense eliminations and corporate expenses not allocated to the other reportable segments. Through our participation in various federal government programs, we generated approximately 23%, 22% and 19% of our total consolidated revenues from agencies of the U.S. government for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. These revenues are contained in the Consumer and Other segments. For additional information regarding the operating results of our segments, see Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 20, “Segment Information,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011, included in this Form 10-K. Products and Services A general description of our products and services is provided below: Preferred Provider Organization. PPO products offer the member an option to select any health care provider, with benefits reimbursed by us at a higher level when care is received from a participating network provider. Coverage is subject to co-payments or deductibles and coinsurance, with member cost sharing usually limited by out-of-pocket maximums. Consumer-Driven Health Plans. CDHPs provide consumers with increased financial responsibility, choice and control regarding how their health care dollars are spent. Generally, CDHPs combine a high-deductible PPO plan with an employer-funded and/or employee-funded personal care account, which may result in tax benefits to the employee. Some or all of the dollars remaining in the personal care account at year-end can be rolled over to the next year for future health care needs. Traditional Indemnity. Indemnity products offer the member an option to select any health care provider for covered services. Coverage is subject to deductibles and coinsurance, with member cost sharing usually limited by out-of-pocket maximums. 8 Table of Contents Health Maintenance Organization. HMO products include comprehensive managed care benefits, generally through a participating network of physicians, hospitals and other providers. A member in one of our HMOs must typically select a primary care physician, or PCP, from our network. PCPs generally are family practitioners, internists or pediatricians who provide necessary preventive and primary medical care, and are generally responsible for coordinating other necessary health care services. We offer HMO plans with varying levels of co-payments, which result in different levels of premium rates. Point-of-Service. POS products blend the characteristics of HMO, PPO and indemnity plans. Members can have comprehensive HMO-style benefits through participating network providers with minimum out-of-pocket expenses (co-payments) and also can go directly, without a referral, to any provider they choose, subject to, among other things, certain deductibles and coinsurance. Member cost sharing is limited by out-of-pocket maximums. Administrative Services. In addition to fully-insured products, we provide administrative services to large group employers that maintain self-funded health plans. These administrative services include underwriting, actuarial services, medical management, claims processing and other administrative services for self-funded employers. Self-funded health plans are also able to use our provider networks and to realize savings through our negotiated provider arrangements, while allowing employers the ability to design certain health benefit plans in accordance with their own requirements and objectives. We also underwrite stop loss insurance for self-funded plans. BlueCard®. BlueCard® host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer sponsored health plan serviced by a non-WellPoint controlled BCBS licensee, who is the “home” plan. We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard® host members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard® members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Senior Plans. We offer a wide variety of senior plans, products and options such as Medicare supplement plans, Medicare Advantage (including private fee-for-service plans and special needs plans) and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans, or Medicare Part D. Medicare supplement plans typically pay the difference between health care costs incurred by a beneficiary and amounts paid by Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans provide Medicare beneficiaries with a managed care alternative to traditional Medicare and often include a Medicare Part D benefit. In addition, our Medicare Advantage special needs plans provide Medicare beneficiaries who have chronic diseases and conditions with tailored benefits designed to meet their unique needs. Medicare Part D offers a prescription drug plan to Medicare and dual eligible (Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries. We offer these plans to customers through our health benefit subsidiaries throughout the country, including CareMore. Individual Plans. We offer a full range of health insurance plans with a variety of options and deductibles for individuals under age 65 who are not covered by employer-sponsored coverage. Some of our products target certain demographic populations such as uninsured younger individuals between the ages of 19 and 29, families and those transitioning between jobs or early retirees. Medicaid Plans and Other State-Sponsored Programs. We have contracts to serve members enrolled in Medicaid, State Children’s Health Insurance programs and other publicly funded health care programs for low income and/or high medical risk individuals. We provide services in California, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, New York, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Pharmacy Products. We market and sell an integrated prescription drug product to both fully-insured and self-funded customers through our health benefit subsidiaries throughout the country. This comprehensive product includes features such as drug formularies, a pharmacy network and maintenance of a prescription drug database and mail order capabilities. Since December 1, 2009, we have delegated certain functions and 9 Table of Contents administrative services related to our integrated prescription drug products to Express Scripts, under a ten year contract. Express Scripts manages the network of pharmacy providers, operates mail order pharmacies and processes prescription drug claims on our behalf, while we sell and support the product for clients, make formulary decisions and set drug benefit design strategy and provide front line member support. Life Insurance. We offer an array of competitive individual and group life insurance benefit products to both large and small group customers in conjunction with our health plans. The life products include term life and accidental death and dismemberment. Disability. We offer short-term and long-term disability programs, usually in conjunction with our health plans. Behavioral Health. We offer specialized behavioral health plans and benefit management. These plans cover mental health and substance abuse treatment services on both an inpatient and an outpatient basis. We have implemented employee assistance and behavioral managed care programs for a wide variety of businesses throughout the United States. These programs are offered through our subsidiaries. Radiology Benefit Management. We offer outpatient diagnostic imaging management services to health plans. These services include utilization management for advanced diagnostic imaging procedures, network development and optimization, patient safety, claims adjudication and provider payment. Personal Health Care Guidance. We offer leading evidence based and analytics-driven personal health care guidance. These services help improve the quality, coordination and safety of health care, enhance communications between patients and their physicians, and reduce medical costs. Dental. Our dental plans include networks in certain states in which we operate. Many of the dental benefits are provided to customers enrolled in our health plans and are offered on both a fully-insured and self-funded basis. Our members also have access to additional dental providers through our participation in the National Dental GRID, a national dental network developed by and for BCBS plans. The National Dental GRID includes dentists in all 50 states and provides multi-state customers with a national solution providing in-network discounts across the country. Additionally, we offer managed dental services to other health care plans to assist those other health care plans in providing dental benefits to their customers. Vision Services. Our vision plans include networks within the states where we operate. Many of the vision benefits are provided to customers enrolled in our health plans and are offered on both a fully-insured and self-funded basis. Long-Term Care Insurance. We offer long-term care insurance products to our California members through a subsidiary. The long-term care products include tax-qualified and non-tax qualified versions of a skilled nursing home care plan and comprehensive policies covering skilled, intermediate and custodial long-term care and home health services. Medicare Administrative Operations. Through our subsidiary, NGS, we serve as a fiscal intermediary, carrier and Medicare administrative contractor providing administrative services for the Medicare program, which generally provides coverage for persons who are 65 or older and for persons who are disabled or with end-stage renal disease. Part A of the Medicare program provides coverage for services provided by hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and other health care facilities. Part B of the Medicare program provides coverage for services provided by physicians, physical and occupational therapists and other professional providers, as well as certain durable medical equipment and medical supplies. 10 Table of Contents Networks and Provider Relations Our relationships with physicians, hospitals and professionals that provide health care services to our members are guided by regional and national standards for network development, reimbursement and contract methodologies. We attempt to provide “market-based” hospital reimbursement along industry standards. We also seek to ensure that physicians in our network are paid in a timely manner at appropriate rates. We use multi-year contracting strategies, including case or fixed rates, to limit our exposure to medical cost inflation and increase cost predictability. We seek to maintain broad provider networks to ensure member choice, based on both price and access needs, while implementing programs designed to improve the quality of care received by our members. Depending on the consolidation and integration of physician groups and hospitals, reimbursement strategies vary across markets. Fee-for-service is our predominant reimbursement methodology for physicians. Physician fee schedules are developed at the state level based on an assessment of several factors and conditions, including The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, resource-based relative value system, or RBRVS, medical practice cost inflation and physician supply. The RBRVS structure was developed and is maintained by CMS, and is used by the Medicare program and other major payers. We utilize CMS RBRVS fee schedules as a reference point for fee schedule development and analysis. In addition, we have implemented and continue to expand physician incentive contracting, or “pay for performance”, which ties physician payment levels to performance on clinical measures. It is generally our philosophy not to delegate full financial responsibility to our physician providers in the form of capitation-based reimbursement. However, in certain markets we believe capitation can be a useful method to lower costs and reduce underwriting risk, and we therefore have some capitation contracts. Our hospital contracts provide for a variety of reimbursement arrangements depending on local market dynamics and current hospital utilization efficiency. Most hospitals are reimbursed a fixed amount per day or reimbursed a per case amount, per admission, for inpatient covered services. Some hospitals, primarily sole community hospitals, are reimbursed on a discount from approved charge basis for covered services. Our “per case” reimbursement methods utilize many of the same attributes contained in Medicare’s Diagnosis Related Groups, or DRG, methodology. Hospital outpatient services are reimbursed by fixed case rates, fee schedules or percent of approved charges. Our hospital contracts recognize unique hospital attributes, such as academic medical centers or community hospitals, and the volume of care performed for our members. To improve predictability of expected cost, we frequently use a multi-year contracting approach and have been transitioning to case rate payment methodologies. Many of our hospital contracts include a “pay for performance” component where reimbursement levels are linked to improved clinical performance, patient safety and medical error reduction. Though fee-for-service or fee-for-service combined with pay for performance remains our predominant payment model today, our provider engagement and contracting strategies are becoming less “unit price” focused and more focused on the total value of care, defined by overall quality and cost. This includes a strong focus on promoting primary care and developing collaborative relationships with physicians that align financial incentives and helping to provide them with the tools they need to effectively manage the health of their population of patients in a way that improves health outcomes and reduces the cost associated with preventable medical events. For example, we are partnering with physicians to advance a number of innovative delivery models such as accountable care organizations, or ACOs, and patient-centered medical homes, or PCMHs, that aim to improve affordability and the quality of care delivered to members. Under an ACO arrangement, providers receive incentives based on quality, cost, safety, clinical outcomes and coordination of care metrics. Through these shared risk arrangements, providers share in the savings achieved through better quality and reduced costs, but may also share the financial risk if results are not achieved. In the PCMH model, primary care physicians adopt a 11 Table of Contents patient-centered care delivery model that focuses on coordinated care management, wellness and preventive care and shared-decision making with patients and their care givers. This model promotes patient engagement and accountability for the patient’s own health. Both of these models help improve quality through enhanced service offerings and better care coordination with other physicians and specialists across the healthcare system. In addition to the opportunity to participate in shared savings, participating physician practices often receive a per-member, per-month care management fee to appropriately compensate physicians for important care management activities that occur outside of the patient visit, enabling a move away from visit-based episodic intervention to proactive patient engagement and care coordination. In the latter half of 2012, we plan to implement additional shared savings opportunities for certain primary care physicians, aimed at further improving the quality of care and health outcomes of our members while reducing medical costs and increasing revenue opportunities for the participating primary care physicians. Under this model, participating primary care physicians will be able to earn additional revenue by expanding access to medical care and also coordinating medical care for patients with chronic conditions. To participate in the shared savings opportunities, primary care physician practices must meet certain plan quality requirements, which include quality standards established by organizations including, but not limited to, the NCQA, the American Diabetes Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Medical Management Programs Our medical management programs include a broad array of activities that facilitate improvements in the quality of care provided to our members and promote cost effective medical care. These medical management activities and programs are administered and directed by physicians and trained nurses. The goals of our medical management strategies are to ensure that the care delivered to our members is supported by appropriate medical and scientific evidence, is received on a timely basis and occurs in the most appropriate location. Precertification. A traditional medical management program involves assessment of the appropriateness of certain hospitalizations and other medical services prior to the service being rendered. For example, precertification is used to determine whether a set of hospital and medical services is being appropriately applied to the member’s clinical condition, in accordance with criteria for medical necessity as that term is defined in the member’s benefits contract. All of our health plans have implemented precertification programs for common high-tech radiology studies, including cardiac diagnostic testing, addressing an area of historically significant cost trends. We are exploring expansion of our outpatient precertification program through AIM into other clinical areas that show significant trend and have demonstrated clinically inappropriate use of services, such as oncology and sleep apnea diagnosis and treatment. We leverage AIM’s services, clinical expertise and technology to facilitate more effective and efficient use of these outpatient services by our members. Care Coordination. Another traditional medical management strategy we use is care coordination, which is based on nationally recognized criteria developed by third-party medical specialists. With inpatient care coordination, the requirements and intensity of services during a patient’s hospital stay are reviewed, at times by an onsite skilled nurse professional in collaboration with the hospital’s medical and nursing staff, in order to coordinate care and determine the most effective transition of care from the hospital setting. In addition, guidance for many continued stay cases is reviewed with physician medical directors to ensure appropriate utilization of medical services. We also coordinate care for outpatient services to help ensure that patients with chronic conditions who receive care from multiple physicians are able to manage the exchange of information between physicians and coordinate office visits to their physicians. Case Management. We are also implementing a medical management strategy focused on identifying the small percentage of the membership that will require a high level of intervention to manage their health care needs. The registered nurses and medical directors focus on members likely to be readmitted to the hospital and help them coordinate their care through pharmacy compliance, post-hospital care, follow-up visits to see their physician and support in their home. 12 Table of Contents Formulary management. We have developed formularies, which are selections of drugs based on clinical quality and effectiveness. A pharmacy and therapeutics committee of physicians uses scientific and clinical evidence to ensure that our members have access to the appropriate drug therapies. This function remained with us after the sale of our PBM business. Medical policy. A medical policy group comprised of physician leaders from various areas of the country, working in cooperation with academic medical centers, practicing community physicians and medical specialty organizations such as the American College of Radiology and national organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Cancer Society, determines our national policy for the application of new medical technologies and treatments. Quality programs. We are actively engaged with our hospital and physician networks to enable them to improve medical and surgical care and achieve better outcomes for our members. We endorse, encourage and incent hospitals and physicians to support national initiatives to improve the quality of clinical care, patient outcomes and to reduce medication errors and hospital infections. We have demonstrated our leadership in developing hospital quality programs. External review procedures. We work with outside experts through a process of external review to provide our members scientifically and clinically, evidence-based medical care. When we receive member concerns, we have formal appeals procedures that ultimately allow coverage disputes related to medical necessity decisions under the benefits contract to be settled by independent expert physicians. Service management. In HMO and POS networks, primary care physicians serve as the overall coordinators of members’ health care needs by providing an array of preventive health services and overseeing referrals to specialists for appropriate medical care. In PPO networks, patients have access to network physicians without a primary care physician serving as the coordinator of care. Anthem Care Comparison. Anthem Care Comparison, or ACC, is an innovative comparison tool that discloses price ranges and quality data for common services at contracted providers, including the facility, professional and ancillary services. The price ranges include a bundle of related services typically performed at the time of the procedure, not just the surgery itself. Users can review cost data for 102 procedures in 48 states and Puerto Rico. ACC provides information on key quality factors such as the number of specific procedures performed, patient safety, facility complication rates, mortality rates and average length of stay. We continue to work on enhancing and evolving the ACC program to assist members in making informed health care decisions. Personal Health Care Guidance. These services help improve the quality, coordination and safety of health care, enhance communications between patients and their physicians, and reduce medical costs. Examples of services include member and physician messaging, providing access to evidence-based medical guidelines, physician quality profiling, and other consulting services. Care Management Programs We continue to expand our 360º Health suite of integrated care management programs and tools. 360º Health offers the following programs, among others, that have been proven to increase quality and reduce medical costs for our members: ConditionCare and FutureMoms are care management and maternity management programs that serve as excellent adjuncts to physician care. Skilled nurse professionals with added support from our team of dietitians, social workers, pharmacists, health educators and other health professionals help participants understand their condition, their doctor’s orders and how to become a better self-manager of their condition. 24/7 NurseLine offers access to qualified, registered nurses anytime. This allows our members to make informed decisions about the appropriate level of care and avoid unnecessary worry. This program also includes 13 Table of Contents a referral process to the nearest urgent care facility, a robust audiotape library, accessible by phone, with more than 400 health and wellness topics, as well as on-line health education topics designed to educate members about symptoms and treatment of many common health concerns. ComplexCare is an advanced care management program that reaches out to participants with multiple health care issues who are at risk for frequent and high levels of medical care in order to offer support and assistance in managing their health care needs. ComplexCare identifies candidates through claims analysis using predictive modeling techniques, the use of health risk assessment data, utilization management reports and referrals from a physician or one of our other programs, such as the 24/7 NurseLine. MyHealth Advantage utilizes integrated information systems and sophisticated data analytics to help our members improve their compliance with evidence-based care guidelines, providing personal care notes that alert members to potential gaps in care, enable more prudent health care choices, and assist in the realization of member out-of-pocket cost savings. Key opportunities are also shared with physicians through Availity® at the time of membership eligibility verification. Availity® is an electronic data interchange system that allows for the exchange of health information among providers over a secure network. MyHealth Coach provides our members with a professional guide who helps them navigate the health care system and make better decisions about their well-being. MyHealth Coach proactively reaches out to people who are at risk for serious health issues or have complex health care needs. Our health coaches help participants understand and manage chronic conditions, handle any health and wellness related services they need and make smart lifestyle choices. HealthyLifestyles helps employees transform unhealthy habits into positive ones by focusing on behaviors that can have a positive effect on their health and their employer’s financial well-being. HealthyLifestyles programs include smoking cessation, weight management, stress management, physical activity and diet and nutrition. MyHealth@Anthem is our secure web-based solution, complementing other programs by reinforcing telephonic coaching and mail campaigns. The website engages participants in regularly assessing their health status, gives them feedback about their progress, and tracks important health measures such as blood pressure, weight and blood glucose levels. Employee Assistance Programs provide many resources that allow members to balance work and personal life by providing quick and easy access to confidential resources to help meet the challenges of daily life. Examples of services available in person as well as via telephone or internet are counseling for child care, health and wellness, financial issues, legal issues, adoption and daily living. Health Care Quality Initiatives Increasingly, the health care industry is able to define quality health care based on preventive health measurements, outcomes of care and optimal care management for chronic disease. A key to our success has been our ability to work with our network physicians and hospitals to improve the quality and outcomes of the health care services provided to our members. Our ability to promote quality medical care has been recognized by the NCQA, the largest and most respected national accreditation program for managed care health plans. Several quality health care measures, including the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set, or HEDIS®, have been incorporated into the NCQA’s accreditation processes. HEDIS® measures range from preventive services, such as screening mammography and pediatric immunization, to elements of care, including decreasing the complications of diabetes and improving treatment for patients with heart disease. For health plans, NCQA’s highest accreditation status of Excellent is granted only to those plans that demonstrate levels of service and clinical quality that meet or exceed NCQA’s rigorous requirements for consumer protection and 14 Table of Contents quality improvement. Plans earning this accreditation level must also achieve HEDIS® results that are in the highest range of national or regional performance. Details for each of our plans’ accreditation levels can be found at www.ncqa.org. We have committed to measuring our progress in improving the quality of care that our members and our communities receive through our proprietary Member Health Index, or MHI, and State Health Index, or SHI. The MHI is comprised of 23 clinically relevant measures for our health plan members and combines prevention, care management, clinical outcome and patient safety metrics. The SHI measures the health of all the residents in our BCBSA licensed states, not just our members, using public data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Our wholly-owned clinical research and health outcomes research subsidiary, HealthCore, has supported biopharmaceutical manufacturers, health professionals, and health plans by enabling more effective medical management and increased physician adherence to evidence-based care, and creating new knowledge on the value of clinical therapies, resulting in better care decisions. Our wholly-owned specialty benefit management subsidiary, AIM, has supported quality by implementing clinical appropriateness and patient safety programs for advanced imaging procedures and specialty pharmaceuticals, including oncology drugs, covered under the medical benefit, that are based on widely accepted clinical guidelines. These programs promote the most appropriate use of these procedures to improve the quality of overall health care delivered to our members and members of other health plans that are covered under AIM’s programs. In addition to its clinical appropriateness program, AIM has also implemented a network assessment OptiNet® program, which promotes more informed selection of diagnostic imaging facilities by providing cost and facility information to physicians at the point that a procedure is ordered. In 2011, we leveraged AIM’s network assessment information to proactively educate our members about imaging site choices based on site capabilities and cost differences. This program is another example of how we facilitate improvements in the quality of care provided to our members and promote cost effective medical care. AIM also provides education on radiation exposure associated with advanced diagnostic procedures to members and physicians to improve patient and provider safety. Our wholly-owned analytics-driven personal health care guidance subsidiary, Resolution Health, Inc., has supported quality by helping our members take action to get healthy, stay healthy and better manage chronic illness. Our analysis of an individual member’s health data identifies opportunities to improve health care quality and safety; we then send personalized messages to the member, their doctor and care manager to take action. For example, our drug safety messages inform a member’s doctor, pharmacist or care manager of potentially dangerous drug-drug, drug-condition, drug-age, or drug-dose interactions identified in our Drug Safety Scan. This helps improve safety, drug effectiveness and medication adherence. Pricing and Underwriting of Our Products We price our products based on our assessment of current health care claim costs and emerging health care cost trends, combined with charges for administrative expenses, risk and profit. We continually review our product designs and pricing guidelines on a national and regional basis so that our products remain competitive and consistent with our profitability goals and strategies. In applying our pricing to each employer group and customer, we maintain consistent, competitive, strict underwriting standards. We employ our proprietary accumulated actuarial data in determining underwriting and pricing parameters. Where allowed by law and regulation, we underwrite individual policies based upon the medical history of the individual applying for coverage, small groups based upon case specific underwriting procedures and large groups based on each group’s aggregate claim experience. Also, we employ credit underwriting procedures with respect to our self-funded products. In most circumstances, our pricing and underwriting decisions follow a prospective rating process in which a fixed premium is determined at the beginning of the contract period. For fully-insured business, any deviation, 15 Table of Contents favorable or unfavorable, from the medical costs assumed in determining the premium is our responsibility. Some of our larger groups employ retrospective rating reviews, where positive experience is partially refunded to the group, and negative experience is charged against a rate stabilization fund established from the group’s favorable experience, or charged against future favorable experience. BCBSA Licenses We are a party to license agreements with the BCBSA that entitle us to the exclusive, and in certain areas, non-exclusive use of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in assigned geographic territories. BCBSA is a national trade association of Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees, the primary function of which is to promote and preserve the integrity of the BCBS names and marks, as well as provide certain coordination among the member companies. Each BCBSA licensee is an independent legal organization and is not responsible for obligations of other BCBSA member organizations. We have no right to market products and services using the BCBS names and marks outside of the states in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. We are required to pay an annual license fee to the BCBSA based on enrollment and also to comply with various operational and financial standards set forth in the licenses. We believe that we and our licensed affiliates are currently in compliance with these standards. The standards under the license agreements may be modified in certain instances by the BCBSA. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K for additional details of our licensing requirements and the impact if we were not to comply with these license agreements. Regulation General Our operations are subject to comprehensive and detailed state, federal and international regulation throughout the jurisdictions in which we do business. As discussed below, the regulatory aspects of the U.S. health care system have been and will continue to be significantly affected by Health Care Reform legislation. Supervisory agencies, including state health, insurance and corporation departments, have broad authority to: • grant, suspend and revoke licenses to transact business; • regulate many aspects of our products and services; • monitor our solvency and reserve adequacy; and • scrutinize our investment activities on the basis of quality, diversification and other quantitative criteria. To carry out these tasks, these regulators periodically examine our operations and accounts. Regulation of Insurance Company and HMO Business Activity The governments of the states in which we conduct business, as well as the federal government, have adopted laws and regulations that govern our business activities in various ways. Further, federal Health Care Reform legislation has resulted in increased federal regulation that is likely to have a significant impact on our business. These laws and regulations, which vary significantly from state to state and on the federal level, may restrict how we conduct our business and may result in additional burdens and costs to us. Areas of governmental regulation include but are not limited to: • medical loss ratios; • tax deductibility of certain compensation; • licensure; • premium rates; • underwriting and pricing; 16 Table of Contents • benefits; • eligibility requirements; • guaranteed renewability; • service areas; • market conduct; • sales and marketing activities; • quality assurance procedures; • plan design and disclosures, including mandated benefits; • underwriting, marketing and rating restrictions for small group products; • utilization review activities; • prompt payment of claims; • member rights and responsibilities; • collection, access or use of protected health information; • data reporting, including financial data and standards for electronic transactions; • payment of dividends; • provider rates of payment; • surcharges on provider payments; • provider contract forms; • provider access standards; • premium taxes, assessments for the uninsured and/or underinsured and insolvency guaranty payments; • member and provider complaints and appeals; • financial condition (including reserves and minimum capital or risk based capital requirements and investments); • reimbursement or payment levels for government funded business; and • corporate governance. These state and federal laws and regulations are subject to amendments and changing interpretations in each jurisdiction. States generally require health insurers and HMOs to obtain a certificate of authority prior to commencing operations. If we were to establish a health insurance company or an HMO in any jurisdiction where we do not presently operate, we generally would have to obtain such a certificate. The time necessary to obtain such a certificate varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Each health insurer and HMO must file periodic financial and operating reports with the states in which it does business. In addition, health insurers and HMOs are subject to state examination and periodic license renewal. The health benefits business also may be adversely impacted by court and regulatory decisions that expand the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations. It is uncertain whether we can recoup, through higher premiums or other measures, the increased costs of mandated benefits or other increased costs caused by potential legislation, regulation or court rulings. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. 17 Table of Contents Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act The ACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, has created significant changes and will continue to create significant changes for health insurance markets for the next several years. Specifically, many of the near-term changes were effective for certain groups and individuals on their first renewal on or after September 23, 2010, including a prohibition on lifetime limits, certain annual limits, member cost-sharing on specified preventive benefits, pre-existing condition exclusions for children, increased restrictions on rescinding coverage and extension of coverage of dependents to the age of 26. Certain requirements for insurers were also effective in 2011, including the minimum medical loss ratio provision that requires insurers to pay rebates to customers when insurers do not meet or exceed the specified medical loss ratio, or MLR, thresholds, and changes to Medicare Advantage payments. Most of the provisions of ACA with more significant effects on the health insurance marketplace go into effect on January 1, 2014, including a requirement that insurers guarantee the issuance of coverage to all individuals regardless of health status, strict rules on how health insurance is rated, the assessment of new taxes and fees (including annual fees on health insurance companies and excise taxes on high premium insurance policies), the creation of new insurance exchanges for individuals and small groups, and substantial expansions in eligibility for Medicaid. Many of the details of the law require additional guidance and specificity to be provided by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Labor, CMS and the Department of the Treasury. In certain cases, these regulatory agencies were directed to accept recommendations from external groups, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC. Some provisions have final rules available for review and comment, while some proposed regulations have yet to be released and others are in-process. We are evaluating each of these rules carefully; and, therefore, it continues to be too early to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall business. Some of the more significant considerations of ACA are described below: • MLR regulations were issued by HHS in December 2011; however, significant changes could still occur to the MLR requirements through additional regulatory guidance and/or modification of the regulation. The minimum MLR thresholds by line of business are as follows: Line of Business % Large Group 85 % Small Group 80 Individual 80 New York state regulations require us to meet a more restrictive MLR threshold of 82% for both Small Group and Individual lines of business. Certain other states have received approval from HHS to phase-in the MLR requirements in the Individual markets in those states and, as a result, are currently using lower thresholds for determination of potential rebates. The minimum MLR thresholds disclosed above are based on definitions of an MLR calculation provided by HHS, or specific states, as applicable, and differ from our calculation of “benefit expense ratio” based on premium revenue and benefit expense as reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The definitions of the lines of business may differ under the various state and federal regulations. • ACA requires states to establish health insurance exchanges by January 1, 2014 through which qualified individuals and qualified small employers may access coverage. If a state fails to establish a health insurance exchange, the federal government will establish a health insurance exchange in that state. While states have some flexibility over the design and implementation of these health insurance exchanges, during 2011 HHS released a series of proposed regulations outlining more detailed requirements for the state establishment of exchanges. As of January 1, 2012, four states in which we conduct business have passed legislation establishing health insurance exchanges (California, Colorado, Connecticut and Nevada). 18 Table of Contents • Regulations became effective in September 2011 that require filings for premium rate increases for small group and individual products above specified thresholds, generally 10%, to be reviewed. The regulations provide for state insurance regulators to conduct the reviews, except for cases where a state does not have an “effective” rate review program, in which case HHS will conduct the reviews for any rate filed. • ACA includes three “risk adjuster” programs that will introduce new requirements beginning in 2014 depending on the risk mix of individuals enrolled in the individual and small group markets. Among other things, these programs require insurers enrolling lower-risk individuals to pay into funds to compensate insurers enrolling higher-risk individuals. Details of these programs in the form of proposed regulations have begun to emerge and will continue to be finalized during 2012 and 2013. States will be given some flexibility to tailor their risk adjustment program. • Depending on the laws in each state, health insurers are currently allowed to consider factors such as health status, gender and age in determining the appropriate premium for products in the individual and small group markets. Some states have currently adopted rules that limit the variation between the highest and lowest premium for the identical insurance policy. The differential in pricing is commonly referred to as “ratings bands”. The process of using these rating bands allows health insurers to appropriately price for products and to spread the risk more broadly across all policyholders. Beginning in 2014, the ACA precludes health insurers from using health status and gender in the determination of the appropriate insurance premium. In addition, rating bands for age cannot vary by more than 3 to 1 and the rating bands for tobacco use cannot vary by more than 1.5 to 1. This change will likely have a significant impact on the majority of individual and small group customers and could lead to adverse selection in the market. • Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates will not increase as much as they would otherwise due to a new payment formula promulgated by ACA that is expected to significantly reduce reimbursements in the future. We also expect further and ongoing regulatory guidance on a number of issues related to Medicare, including the Medicare Advantage MLR, evolving methodology for ratings and quality bonus payments and potential action on an audit methodology to review data submitted under “risk adjuster” programs. Recent federal court decisions questioning the constitutionality of all or portions of the federal Health Care Reform legislation add further uncertainty to our ability to understand the ultimate impacts of the legislation on our business. The challenges primarily deal with the requirement that most individuals purchase health insurance and whether that provision is severable from other areas of the ACA. The United States Supreme Court, or Supreme Court, will hear an appeal of several of the federal court decisions in March 2012 and it is expected that the Supreme Court will render its opinion by the close of its term near the end of June 2012. The Supreme Court could rule in several ways, including that the law is constitutional in its entirety, allowing for continued implementation of the law’s requirements. The Supreme Court could determine that a portion of the law is constitutional, resulting in implementation of certain portions of the law with the remaining requirements being disallowed. Finally, the Supreme Court could determine that the law is unconstitutional in its entirety, which would result in the reversal of the law’s requirements. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act During 2010, the U.S. Congress passed and the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a far-reaching overhaul of the framework for the U.S. financial services industry. Even though we are primarily a health benefits company, our business may be impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act. Many of its provisions require the adoption of rules for implementation, including those that govern which non-bank financial companies may become subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Dodd-Frank Act identifies non-bank financial companies that may become subject to Federal Reserve oversight as those that could pose a threat to financial stability either due to the potential of material financial distress at the company or due to the company’s ongoing 19 Table of Contents activities. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, or the Council, published proposed criteria and a framework for determining which non-bank financial companies meet these definitions. These criteria and framework are subject to a public comment period and will then result in final rules that may or may not be different from the proposals. The Council announced that it will begin evaluating companies against the final rules shortly thereafter. Although unlikely, we believe that we might be considered a non-bank financial company and it is possible that we could become subject to additional oversight by the Federal Reserve under the final rules. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act creates a Federal Insurance Office, with limited powers that include information-gathering and subpoena authority. Although the Federal Insurance Office does not have authority over health insurance, it may have authority over other parts of our business, such as life insurance. HIPAA and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes obligations for issuers of health insurance coverage and health benefit plan sponsors. This law requires guaranteed renewability of health care coverage for most group health plans and certain individuals. Also, the law limits exclusions based on preexisting medical conditions. The Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA imposed a number of requirements on covered entities (including insurers, HMOs, group health plans, providers and clearinghouses). These requirements include uniform standards of common electronic health care transactions; privacy and security regulations; and unique identifier rules for employers, health plans and providers. Additional federal privacy and security requirements, including breach notification, improved enforcement and additional limitations on use and disclosure of protected health information were passed through the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH, provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and corresponding implementing regulations. CMS posted the Interim Final Rule with Comment, or IFC, adopting operating rules for two electronic transactions: eligibility for a health plan and health care claims status. Based on the comments received on the IFC, CMS has decided not to change any of the policies established in the rule. Thus, the interim final rule is the final rule that is in effect; industry implementation should be underway for the January 1, 2013 compliance date. The federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally places restrictions on the disclosure of non-public information to non-affiliated third parties, and requires financial institutions, including insurers, to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal information is used, including an opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures. State departments of insurance and certain federal agencies adopted implementing regulations as required by federal law. A number of states have adopted data security laws and/or regulations, regulating data security and/or requiring security breach notification, which may apply to us in certain circumstances. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 The provision of services to certain employee welfare benefit plans is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, a complex set of laws and regulations subject to interpretation and enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor. ERISA regulates certain aspects of the relationships between us, the employers who maintain employee welfare benefit plans subject to ERISA and participants in such plans. Some of our administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under ERISA. In addition, certain states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims administration services for benefit plans. We provide a variety of products and services to employee welfare benefit plans that are covered by ERISA. Plans subject to ERISA can also be subject to state laws and the question of whether and to what extent ERISA preempts a state law has been, and will continue to be, interpreted by many courts. 20 Table of Contents HMO and Insurance Holding Company Laws, including Risk-Based Capital Requirements We are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and HMO subsidiaries are domiciled. These acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or HMO and its affiliates. These holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and HMOs within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states’ insurance departments certain reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. In addition, various notice and reporting requirements generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and HMOs and their affiliates within an insurance holding company system, depending on the size and nature of the transactions. Some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or, in certain circumstances, prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies, HMOs, their parent holding companies and affiliates. Among other provisions, state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. Additionally, the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company, which controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company. “Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person. The states of domicile of our regulated subsidiaries have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies and HMOs based on the RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to assess the capital adequacy of life and health insurers and HMOs, taking into account the risk characteristics of a company’s investments and products. In general, under these laws, an insurance company or HMO must submit a report of its RBC level to the insurance department or insurance commissioner of its state of domicile for each calendar year. The law requires increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as a company’s RBC declines. As of December 31, 2011, the RBC levels of our insurance and HMO subsidiaries exceeded all RBC thresholds. Guaranty Fund Assessments Under insolvency or guaranty association laws in most states, insurance companies can be assessed for amounts paid by guaranty funds for policyholder losses incurred when an insurance company becomes insolvent. Most state insolvency or guaranty association laws currently provide for assessments based upon the amount of premiums received on insurance underwritten within such state (with a minimum amount payable even if no premium is received). Under many of these guaranty association laws, assessments against insurance companies that issue policies of accident or sickness insurance are made retrospectively. Some states permit insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets or through future policyholder assessments. While the amount and timing of any future assessments cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that future guaranty association assessments for insurer insolvencies will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources with the exception of potential exposure related to the Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary American Network Insurance Company insolvency as discussed in Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies”, to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011, included in this Form 10-K. 21 Table of Contents Employees At December 31, 2011, we had approximately 37,700 employees. Our employees are an important asset, and we seek to develop them to their full potential. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

WellPoint, Inc. is an Indiana corporation incorporated on July 17, 2001. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all our potential risks or uncertainties. Because of these and other factors, past performance should not be considered an indication of future performance. Federal Health Care Reform legislation, as well as expected additional changes in federal or state regulations, could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operation. The passage of Health Care Reform legislation during 2010 represents significant changes to the current U.S. health care system. The legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage over time by increasing the eligibility thresholds for most state Medicaid programs and providing certain other individuals and small businesses with tax credits to subsidize a portion of the cost of health insurance coverage. The legislation includes a requirement that most individuals obtain health insurance coverage beginning in 2014 and also a requirement that certain large employers offer coverage to their employees or pay a financial penalty. In addition, the new laws include certain new taxes and fees, including an excise tax on high premium insurance policies, limitations on the amount of compensation that is tax deductible and new fees on companies in our industry, some of which will not be deductible for income tax purposes. The legislation also imposes new regulations on the health insurance sector, including, but not limited to, guaranteed coverage requirements, prohibitions on some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to our members, increased restrictions on rescinding coverage, establishment of minimum medical loss ratio requirements, a requirement to cover preventive services on a first dollar basis, the establishment of state insurance exchanges and essential benefit packages and greater limitations on how we price certain of our products. The legislation also reduces the reimbursement levels for health plans participating in the Medicare Advantage program over time. 22 Table of Contents Some of the provisions of the Health Care Reform legislation became effective immediately upon enactment, while other provisions will become effective over the next several years. These changes could impact us through potential disruption to the employer-based market, potential cost shifting in the health care delivery system to health insurance companies and limitations on the ability to increase premiums to meet costs. We will need to dedicate material resources and incur material expenses to implement and comply with Health Care Reform at both the state and federal levels, including implementing and complying with the future regulations that will provide guidance on and clarification of significant portions of the legislation. The Health Care Reform law and regulations are likely to have significant effects on our future operations, which, in turn, could impact the value of our business model and results of operations, including potential impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets. There are currently constitutional challenges to the Health Care Reform legislation. If certain portions of the legislation are declared unconstitutional, such as the individual obligation to purchase insurance, while other portions are upheld, such as the guaranteed coverage requirements and the greater limitations on how we price certain of our products, this could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies may further restrict our ability to obtain new product approvals, implement changes in premium rates or impose additional restrictions, under new or existing laws that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the regulation of our business by state and federal regulators may adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance, managed health care and HMO subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the insurance, managed health care or HMO regulatory authorities of each state in which they are licensed or authorized to do business, as well as to regulation by federal and local agencies. We cannot assure that future regulatory action by state insurance or HMO authorities or federal regulatory authorities will not have a material adverse effect on the profitability or marketability of our health benefits or managed care products or on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because of our participation in government-sponsored programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, changes in government regulations or policy with respect to, among other things, reimbursement levels, eligibility requirements and additional governmental participation could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot ensure that application of the federal and/or state tax regulatory regime that currently applies to us will not, or future tax regulation by either federal and/or state governmental authorities concerning us could not, have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. State legislatures will continue to focus on health care delivery and financing issues in the wake of Health Care Reform. Most states are very focused on how to manage and reduce their budgets and are exploring ways to mitigate costs. As such, they are contemplating significant reform of their health insurance markets to include provisions affecting both public programs and privately-financed health insurance arrangements. As these proposals are still being debated in the various legislatures, we cannot assure you that, if enacted into law, these proposals would not have a negative impact on our business, operations or financial condition. In addition, California continues to consider legislative proposals to require prior regulatory approval of premium rate increases or establish minimum benefit expense ratio thresholds. These proposals include a potential ballot proposition regarding prior regulatory approval of rate increases for the individual and small group products, which, if passed, could prevent us from securing necessary rate and benefit changes. This initiative has not yet qualified to be included on the ballot. If enacted, these state proposals could have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. States also continue to engage in stakeholder discussions around the establishment of exchanges, although some states that appeared to be considering options in this regard in earnest now seem to be waiting to advance proposals until there is additional clarity given by the Supreme Court about the constitutionality of Health Care Reform. 23 Table of Contents From time to time, Congress has considered various forms of managed care reform legislation which, if adopted, could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under ERISA. Additionally, there have been legislative attempts to limit ERISA’s preemptive effect on state laws and litigants’ ability to seek damages beyond the benefits offered under their plans. If adopted, such limitations could increase our liability exposure, could permit greater state regulation of our operations, and could expand the scope of damages, including punitive damages, litigants could be awarded. While we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become effective or, if enacted, what their terms will be, their enactment could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business. Further, as we continue to implement our e-business initiatives, uncertainty surrounding the regulatory authority and requirements in this area may make it difficult to ensure compliance. Our inability to contain health care costs, implement increases in premium rates on a timely basis, maintain adequate reserves for policy benefits, maintain our current provider agreements or avoid a downgrade in our credit ratings may adversely affect our business and profitability. Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting health care costs and on our ability to manage future health care costs through underwriting criteria, medical management, product design and negotiation of favorable provider contracts. Government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement have also caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care costs. Changes in health care practices, demographic characteristics, inflation, new technologies, the cost of prescription drugs, clusters of high cost cases, changes in the regulatory environment and numerous other factors affecting the cost of health care may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care costs, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our results of operations. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be adversely affected. In addition to the challenge of managing health care costs, we face pressure to contain premium rates. Our customer contracts may be subject to renegotiation as customers seek to contain their costs. Alternatively, our customers may move to a competitor to obtain more favorable premiums. Further, federal and state regulatory agencies may restrict our ability to implement changes in premium rates. For example, ACA includes an annual rate review requirement to prohibit unreasonable rate increases. Fiscal concerns regarding the continued viability of programs such as Medicare and Medicaid may cause decreasing reimbursement rates or a lack of sufficient increase in reimbursement rates for government-sponsored programs in which we participate. A limitation on our ability to increase or maintain our premium or reimbursement levels or a significant loss of membership resulting from our need to increase or maintain premium or reimbursement levels could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. The reserves that we establish for health insurance policy benefits and other contractual rights and benefits are based upon assumptions concerning a number of factors, including trends in health care costs, expenses, general economic conditions and other factors. To the extent the actual claims experience is less favorable than estimated based on our underlying assumptions, our incurred losses would increase and future earnings could be adversely affected. Our profitability is dependent in part upon our ability to contract on favorable terms with hospitals, physicians and other health care providers. The failure to maintain or to secure cost-effective health care provider contracts may result in a loss of membership or higher medical costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, our inability to contract with providers, or the inability of providers to provide adequate care, could adversely affect our business. We do not have contracts with all providers that render services to our members and, as a result, do not have a pre-established agreement about the amount of compensation those out-of-network providers will accept for the services they render, which can result in significant litigation or arbitration proceedings. 24 Table of Contents Claims-paying ability and financial strength ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and health benefits companies. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future. We believe our strong credit ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to customers, since credit ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. If our credit ratings are downgraded or placed under review, with possible negative implications, such actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders and creditors, and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock. A significant reduction in the enrollment in our health benefits programs could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability. A significant reduction in the number of enrollees in our health benefits programs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could contribute to a reduction in enrollment include: reductions in workforce by existing customers; general economic downturn that results in business failures; employers no longer offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or electing to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis; state and federal regulatory changes; failure to obtain new customers or retain existing customers; premium increases and benefit changes; our exit from a specific market; negative publicity and news coverage; and failure to attain or maintain nationally recognized accreditations. There are various risks associated with participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs, and contracting with CMS to provide Medicare Part C and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug benefits. We offer Medicare approved prescription drug plans (Medicare Part D) nationally and Medicare Advantage plans (Medicare Part C) in select states and/or counties where we are licensed to use the “Blue” brands to market our plans to Medicare eligible individuals. In addition, we provide various administrative services for other entities offering medical and/or prescription drug plans to their Medicare eligible employees and retirees through our affiliated companies. We also participate in Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicaid programs and receive revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs to provide benefits under these programs. Revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government and/or applicable state governments. Funding for these programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities. An unexpected reduction or inadequate government funding for these programs may adversely affect our revenues and financial results. Risks associated with the Medicare Advantage and Medicare prescription drug plans include potential uncollectability of receivables resulting from processing and/or verifying enrollment, inadequacy of underwriting assumptions, inability to receive and process correct information (including inability due to systems issues by the federal government, the applicable state government or us), uncollectability of premiums from members, increased medical or pharmaceutical costs, and the underlying seasonality of this business. While we believe we have adequately reviewed our assumptions and estimates regarding these complex and wide-ranging programs under Medicare Part C and D, including those related to collectability of receivables and establishment of liabilities, the actual results may be materially different than our assumptions and estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. CMS is currently conducting competitive procurements to replace the current fiscal intermediary and carrier contracts with contracts that conform to the Federal Acquisition Regulations. These new contracts, referred to as Medicare Administrative Contracts, or MACs, will combine most of the administrative activities currently 25 Table of Contents performed by the existing intermediaries and carriers. At year end 2011, NGS held two MACs as a prime contractor and supported two MACs as a subcontractor. If NGS fails to be awarded new MACs as a result of this competitive procurement process, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. The laws and regulations governing participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and are subject to regular change and interpretation, which can expose us to penalties for non-compliance. Of note, and consistent with the preceding sentence, CMS has been conducting audits of our Medicare Advantage health plans to validate the diagnostic data and patient claims that are submitted to CMS. These audits may result in retrospective adjustments in payments made to our health plans. In addition, if we fail to correct errors discovered during an audit or otherwise fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal fines, civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in these programs, and on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, legislative or regulatory changes to these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs. The securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility, although current market conditions are more stable. In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers. We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, make payments on our indebtedness and pay capital expenditures. The principal sources of our cash receipts are premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to our industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If one or a combination of these factors were to occur, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms. One of our sources of liquidity is our $2,500.0 million commercial paper program, with $799.8 million and $336.2 million outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we intend to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our $2,000.0 million senior revolving credit facility to redeem our commercial paper when it matures. While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we believe the lenders participating in our senior credit facility will be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. The value of our investments is influenced by varying economic and market conditions, and a decrease in value may result in a loss charged to income. The market values of our investments vary from time to time depending on economic and market conditions. For various reasons, we may sell certain of our investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of the investments. In addition, in periods of declining interest rates, bond calls and mortgage loan prepayments generally increase, resulting in the reinvestment of these funds at the then lower market rates. In periods of rising interest rates, the market values of our fixed maturity securities will generally decrease, which could result in material unrealized or realized losses on investments in future periods. In addition, defaults by issuers, primarily from investments in corporate and municipal bonds, who fail to pay or perform their obligations, could reduce net investment income, which would adversely affect our profitability. We cannot assure you that our investment portfolios will produce positive returns in future periods. 26 Table of Contents Current and long-term available-for-sale investment securities were $17,376.8 million at December 31, 2011 and represented 33% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2011. In accordance with FASB guidance for debt and equity investments, we classify fixed maturity and equity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” or “trading” and report those securities at fair value. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we review our investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis analyzing both quantitative and qualitative factors. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. Changes in the economic environment, including periods of increased volatility of the securities markets can increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and we believe that we have appropriately estimated the fair values of our investment securities. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight, which could change our judgment regarding the fair value of certain securities and/or impairment. Given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and material other-than-temporary impairments may be charged to income in future periods, resulting in realized losses. Regional concentrations of our business may subject us to economic downturns in those regions. The national economy has continued to experience a downturn, with the potential for continued high unemployment. Most of our revenues are generated in the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. Due to this concentration of business in these states, we are exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of a more severe economic downturn in these states. If economic conditions do not improve, we may experience a reduction in existing and new business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. The health benefits industry is subject to negative publicity, which can adversely affect our business and profitability. The health benefits industry is subject to negative publicity. Negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by: adversely affecting our ability to market our products and services; requiring us to change our products and services; or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate. In addition, as long as we use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in marketing our health benefits products and services, any negative publicity concerning the BCBSA or other BCBSA licensees may adversely affect us and the sale of our health benefits products and services. Any such negative publicity could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. We face competition in many of our markets and customers and brokers have flexibility in moving between competitors. As a health benefits company, we operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is currently subject to significant changes from legislative reform, business consolidations, new strategic alliances, aggressive marketing practices by other health benefits organizations and market pressures brought about by an informed and organized customer base, particularly among large employers. This environment has produced and will likely continue to produce significant pressures on the profitability of health benefits companies. 27 Table of Contents We are currently dependent on the non-exclusive services of independent agents and brokers in the marketing of our health care products, particularly with respect to individuals, seniors and small employer group members. We face intense competition for the services and allegiance of these independent agents and brokers, who may also market the products of our competitors. Our relationship with our brokers and independent agents could be adversely impacted by changes in our business practices to address Health Care Reform legislation, including potential reductions in commissions and consulting fees paid to agents and brokers. We cannot ensure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. We face intense competition to attract and retain employees. Further, managing Chief Executive Officer and key executive succession and retention is critical to our success. We are dependent on retaining existing employees and attracting additional qualified employees to meet current and future needs and achieving productivity gains from our investments in technology. We face intense competition for qualified employees, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that such competition among potential employers will not result in increasing salaries. An inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for succession of our Chief Executive Officer, and senior management and retention of key executives. While we have succession plans in place and we have employment arrangements with certain key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us. A change in our health care product mix may impact our profitability. Our health care products that involve greater potential risk generally tend to be more profitable than administrative services products and those health care products where the employer groups assume the underwriting risks. Individuals and small employer groups are more likely to purchase our higher-risk health care products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditures. Typically, government-sponsored programs also involve our higher-risk health care products. A shift of enrollees from more profitable products to less profitable products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As a holding company, we are dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries. These dividends are necessary to pay our outstanding indebtedness. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to state regulations, including restrictions on the payment of dividends, maintenance of minimum levels of capital and restrictions on investment portfolios. We are a holding company whose assets include all of the outstanding shares of common stock of our subsidiaries including our intermediate holding companies and regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities. As a holding company, we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries. Furthermore, our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us, and creditors of our subsidiaries will have a superior claim to certain of our subsidiaries’ assets. Among other restrictions, state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. In some states we have made special undertakings that may limit the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, our subsidiaries’ ability to make any payments to us will also depend on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, business and tax considerations and other legal restrictions. Our ability to repurchase shares or pay dividends in the future to our shareholders and meet our obligations, including paying operating expenses and debt service on our outstanding and future indebtedness, will depend upon the receipt of dividends from our subsidiaries. An inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends in the future in an amount sufficient for us to meet our financial obligations may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. 28 Table of Contents Most of our regulated subsidiaries are subject to RBC standards, imposed by their states of domicile. These laws are based on the RBC Model Act adopted by the NAIC and require our regulated subsidiaries to report their results of risk-based capital calculations to the departments of insurance and the NAIC. Failure to maintain the minimum RBC standards could subject our regulated subsidiaries to corrective action, including state supervision or liquidation. Our regulated subsidiaries are currently in compliance with the risk-based capital or other similar requirements imposed by their respective states of domicile. As discussed in more detail below, we are a party to license agreements with the BCBSA which contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations, including minimum capital and liquidity requirements, which could restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain riskier investment categories, such as below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and equity investments, which could generate higher returns on our investments. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations might cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and risk-based capital, and, in some instances, require the sale of those investments. We have substantial indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Such indebtedness could also adversely affect our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities. As of December 31, 2011, we had indebtedness outstanding of approximately $9,795.4 million and had available borrowing capacity of approximately $2,000.0 million under our senior revolving credit facility, which expires on September 29, 2016. Our debt service obligations require us to use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal on debt instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to seek extraordinary dividends from our subsidiaries, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. However, these measures might be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service obligations. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. Our breach or failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreement. If we default under our credit agreement, the lenders could cease to make further extensions of credit or cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under our credit agreement to become immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If the indebtedness under our notes or our credit agreement is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due. Indebtedness could also limit our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities, and may affect our ability to maintain an investment grade rating for our indebtedness. We face risks related to litigation. We are, or may in the future, be a party to a variety of legal actions that affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits and administrative charges before government agencies, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims and intellectual property-related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management and offering of our products and services. These could include claims relating to the denial of health care benefits; the rescission of health insurance policies; development or application of medical policy; medical malpractice actions; allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities; provider disputes over compensation; provider tiering programs; termination of provider contracts; self-funded business; disputes over co-payment calculations; reimbursement of out-of-network claims; the failure to disclose certain business or corporate governance practices; and customer audits and contract performance, including government contracts. We also may be required to participate in state 29 Table of Contents insurance guaranty association programs, which could require us to pay a portion of policyholder claims of insolvent insurers. These actions or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are also involved in, or may in the future be party to, pending or threatened litigation of the character incidental to the business transacted, arising out of our operations or our 2001 demutualization, including, but not limited to, breaches of security and violations of privacy requirements, shareholder actions, compliance with federal and state laws and regulations, or sales and acquisitions of businesses or assets, and are from time to time involved as a party in various governmental investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings. These investigations, audits and reviews include routine and special investigations by various state insurance departments, state attorneys general and the U.S. Attorney General. Such investigations could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions. Liabilities that may result from these actions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations or financial position. Recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. In some cases, substantial non-economic, treble or punitive damages may be sought. We currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities. Other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. Any adverse judgment against us resulting in such damage awards could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. There are various risks associated with providing health care services. Many states in which we operate our CareMore subsidiary limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals. Business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians (“corporate practice of medicine”) and we are not licensed to practice medicine. Rules and regulations relating to the practice of medicine, fee-splitting between physicians and referral sources, and similar issues vary from state to state. Further, certain federal and state laws prohibit the offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce, or in return for, the referral of patient care opportunities, including, but not limited to, Medicare patients, (“anti-kickback rules”) and also generally prohibit physicians from making referrals to any entity providing certain designated health services if the referring physician or related person has an ownership or financial interest in the entity (“self-referral rules”). We believe that our health care service operations comply with applicable rules and regulations regarding the corporate practice of medicine, fee-splitting, anti-kickback, self-referral and similar issues. However, any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging non-compliance with these rules and regulations could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. The direct provision of health care services also involves risks of additional litigation arising from medical malpractice actions based on our treatment decisions or brought against us or our physician associates for alleged malpractice or professional liability claims arising out of the delivery of health care and related services. In addition, liability may arise from maintaining health care premises that serve the public. If we fail to maintain adequate insurance coverage for these liabilities, or if such insurance is not available, the resulting costs could adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. 30 Table of Contents We are a party to license agreements with the BCBSA that entitle us to the exclusive and in certain areas non-exclusive use of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in our geographic territories. The termination of these license agreements or changes in the terms and conditions of these license agreements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks as identifiers for our products and services under licenses from the BCBSA. Our license agreements with the BCBSA contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks, including: minimum capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the BCBSA; enrollment and customer service performance requirements; participation in programs that provide portability of membership between plans; disclosures to the BCBSA relating to enrollment and financial conditions; disclosures as to the structure of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield system in contracts with third parties and in public statements; plan governance requirements; a requirement that at least 80% (or, in the case of Blue Cross of California, substantially all) of a licensee’s annual combined local net revenue, as defined by the BCBSA, attributable to health benefit plans within its service areas must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks; a requirement that at least 66 2/3% of a licensee’s annual combined national net revenue, as defined by the BCBSA, attributable to health benefit plans must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks; a requirement that neither a plan nor any of its licensed affiliates may permit an entity other than a plan or a licensed affiliate to obtain control of the plan or the licensed affiliate or to acquire a substantial portion of its assets related to licensable services; a requirement that we divide our Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms; a requirement that we guarantee certain contractual and financial obligations of our licensed affiliates; and a requirement that we indemnify the BCBSA against any claims asserted against it resulting from the contractual and financial obligations of any subsidiary that serves as a fiscal intermediary providing administrative services for Medicare Parts A and B. Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements could result in a termination of the license agreements. The standards under the license agreements may be modified in certain instances by the BCBSA. For example, from time to time there have been proposals considered by the BCBSA to modify the terms of the license agreements to restrict various potential business activities of licensees. These proposals have included, among other things, a limitation on the ability of a licensee to make its provider networks available to insurance carriers or other entities not holding a Blue Cross or Blue Shield license. To the extent that such amendments to the license agreements are adopted in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our future expansion plans or results of operations. Further, BCBS licensees have certain requirements to perform administrative services for members of other BCBS licensees. If we or another BCBS licensee is not in compliance with all legal requirements or are unable to perform administrative services as required, this could have an adverse effect on our members and our ability to maintain our licenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Upon the occurrence of an event causing termination of the license agreements, we would no longer have the right to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in one or more of our service areas. Furthermore, the BCBSA would be free to issue a license to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in these service areas to another entity. Events that could cause the termination of a license agreement with the BCBSA include failure to comply with minimum capital requirements imposed by the BCBSA, a change of control or violation of the BCBSA ownership limitations on our capital stock, impending financial insolvency and the appointment of a trustee or receiver or the commencement of any action against a licensee seeking its dissolution. We believe that the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks are valuable identifiers of our products and services in the marketplace. Accordingly, termination of the license agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Upon termination of a license agreement, the BCBSA would impose a “Re-establishment Fee” upon us, which would allow the BCBSA to “re-establish” a Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield presence in the vacated service area. Through December 31, 2011 the fee was set at $98.33 per licensed enrollee. As of December 31, 2011 we 31 Table of Contents reported 29.0 million Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield enrollees. If the Re-establishment Fee was applied to our total Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield enrollees, we would be assessed approximately $2.9 billion by the BCBSA. Large-scale medical emergencies may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Large-scale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread illness and death. For example, federal and state law enforcement officials have issued warnings about potential terrorist activity involving biological and other weapons. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes and the potential for a wide-spread pandemic of influenza coupled with the lack of availability of appropriate preventative medicines can have a significant impact on the health of the population of wide-spread areas. If the United States were to experience widespread bioterrorism or other attacks, large-scale natural disasters in our concentrated coverage areas or a large-scale pandemic or epidemic, our covered medical expenses could rise and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations or, in the event of extreme circumstances, our viability could be threatened. We have built a significant portion of our current business through mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances and we expect to pursue such opportunities in the future. The following are some of the risks associated with mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances (collectively, “business combinations”) that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations: • some of the acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow; • we may establish goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of a future business combination, which may be incorrectly valued or become non-recoverable; • we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or which were under-estimated; • we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully, or as quickly as expected, and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; • business combinations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures; • we may finance future business combinations by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price, which could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders; • we may also incur additional debt related to future business combinations; and • we would be competing with other firms, some of which may have greater financial and other resources, to acquire attractive companies. The value of our intangible assets may become impaired. Due largely to our past mergers and acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $21,790.4 million as of December 31, 2011, representing approximately 42% of our total assets and 94% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2011. If we make additional acquisitions it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to income may be necessary. This impairment testing requires us to make assumptions and 32 Table of Contents judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, including goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives). In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately. Estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in future impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders’ equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. In addition, the estimated value of our reporting units may be impacted as a result of business decisions we make associated with the implementation of the various Health Care Reform regulations. Such decisions, which could unfavorably affect our ability to support the carrying value of certain goodwill and other intangible assets, could result in impairment charges in future periods. We may not be able to realize the value of our deferred tax assets. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we separately recognize deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. At each financial reporting date, we evaluate our deferred tax assets to determine the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences. Our evaluation includes a review of the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset; the amount of taxes paid on both capital gains and ordinary income in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim; the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, the likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and any other significant issues that might impact the realization of the deferred tax asset. If it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance. Significant judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance. Any future increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense and a decrease in shareholders’ equity, which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the increase occurs. A material decrease in shareholders’ equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. An unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and profitability. As part of our normal operations, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential member information. We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information, including HIPAA and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Despite the security measures we have in place to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information, whether by us or by one of our vendors, could result in enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations. 33 Table of Contents The failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information systems could adversely affect our business. Our business depends significantly on effective information systems, and we have many different information systems for our various businesses. As a result of our merger and acquisition activities, we have acquired additional systems. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, compliance with legal requirements (such as a new set of standardized diagnostic codes, known as ICD-10), and changing customer preferences. In addition, we may from time to time obtain significant portions of our systems-related or other services or facilities from independent third parties, which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately. Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the information we rely upon to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could have a decrease in membership, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing and reserves, have disputes with customers and providers, have regulatory problems, sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. In addition, federal regulations require that we begin using ICD-10 by October 2013, which will require significant information technology investment. If we fail to adequately implement ICD-10, we may incur losses with respect to the resources invested and have other material adverse effects on our business and results of operations. Also, as we convert or migrate members to our more efficient and effective systems, the risk of disruption in our customer service is increased during the migration or conversion process and such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. We are working towards becoming a premier e-business organization by modernizing interactions with customers, brokers, agents, providers, employees and other stakeholders through web-enabling technology and redesigning internal operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to fully realize our e-business vision. The failure to maintain successful e-business capabilities could result in competitive and cost disadvantages to us as compared to our competitors. We are dependent on the success of our relationship with a large vendor for a significant portion of our information system resources and certain other vendors for various other services. We have an agreement with International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, pursuant to which we outsourced a significant portion of our data center operations and certain core applications development. We are dependent upon IBM for these support functions. The IBM agreement includes service level agreements, or SLAs, related to issues such as performance and job disruption, with significant financial penalties if these SLAs are not met, as well as termination assistance provisions obligating IBM to provide services during periods following transitions or terminations. If our relationship with IBM is significantly disrupted for any reason, we may not be able to find an alternative partner in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. As a result, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and, in turn, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. We may not be adequately indemnified against all possible losses through the terms and conditions of the IBM agreement. In addition, some of our termination rights are contingent upon payment of a fee, which may be significant. We entered into a ten-year contract for Express Scripts to provide PBM services to our members in connection with the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts in December 2009. Express Scripts is now the exclusive provider of certain specified pharmacy benefits management services, such as pharmacy network management, home delivery, pharmacy customer service, claims processing, rebate management, drug utilization 34 Table of Contents and specialty pharmaceutical management services. Accordingly, the agreement contains certain financial and operational requirements obligating both Express Scripts and us. The failure of either party to meet the respective agreements could potentially serve as a basis for early termination of the contract. If this relationship was terminated for any reason, we may not be able to find alternative partners in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. As a result, we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations. In addition, our failure to meet certain minimum script volume requirements may result in financial penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We have also entered into agreements with certain vendors pursuant to which we have outsourced certain back-office functions. If any of these vendor relationships were terminated for any reason, we may not be able to find an alternative partner in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. In addition, if for any reason there is a business continuity interruption resulting from loss of access to or availability of data, the physical location, technological resources and/or adequate human assets, we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers and, in turn, our business, cash flow, financial conditions and results of operations may be unfavorably impacted. Indiana law, and other applicable laws, and our articles of incorporation and bylaws, may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider in their best interest. Indiana law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent our shareholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. We are regulated as an insurance holding company and subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, as well as similar provisions included in the health statutes and regulations of certain states where these subsidiaries are regulated as managed care companies or HMOs. The insurance holding company acts and regulations and these similar health provisions restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes and regulations, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of a domestic insurance company or HMO, or an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company, insurance company or HMO. “Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person. Further, the Indiana business corporation law contains business combination provisions that, in general, prohibit for five years any business combination with a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our common stock unless the holder’s acquisition of the stock was approved in advance by our Board of Directors. Our articles of incorporation restrict the beneficial ownership of our capital stock in excess of specific ownership limits. The ownership limits restrict beneficial ownership of our voting capital stock to less than 10% for institutional investors and less than 5% for non-institutional investors, both as defined in our articles of incorporation. Additionally, no person may beneficially own shares of our common stock representing a 20% or more ownership interest in us. These restrictions are intended to ensure our compliance with the terms of our licenses with the BCBSA. Our articles of incorporation prohibit ownership of our capital stock beyond these ownership limits without prior approval of a majority of our continuing directors (as defined in our articles of incorporation). In addition, as discussed above in the risk factor describing our license agreements with the BCBSA, such license agreements are subject to termination upon a change of control and re-establishment fees would be imposed upon termination of the license agreements. 35 Table of Contents Certain other provisions included in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may also have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider in their best interests. In particular, our articles of incorporation and bylaws: divide our Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms (which is also required by our license agreement with the BCBSA); permit our Board of Directors to determine the terms of and issue one or more series of preferred stock without further action by shareholders; restrict the maximum number of directors; limit the ability of shareholders to remove directors; impose restrictions on shareholders’ ability to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors; prohibit shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders; impose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at meetings of shareholders; and prohibit shareholders from amending our bylaws. We also face other risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, which include: • any requirement to restate financial results in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles; • a significant failure of our internal control over financial reporting; • our inability to convert to international financial reporting standards, if required; • failure of our prevention and control systems related to employee compliance with internal policies, including data security; • provider fraud that is not prevented or detected and impacts our medical costs or those of self-insured customers; • failure to protect our proprietary information; and • failure of our corporate governance policies or procedures. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED SEC STAFF COMMENTS. None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. Our principal executive offices are located at 120 Monument Circle, Indianapolis, Indiana. In addition to this location, we have other principal operating facilities located in each of the 14 states where we operate as licensees of the BCBSA. A majority of these locations are leased properties. Our facilities support our various business segments. We believe that our properties are adequate and suitable for our business as presently conducted as well as for the foreseeable future. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein) References to the terms “we”, “our” or “us” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, refer to WellPoint, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, included in this Form 10-K. Overview We currently manage our operations through three reportable segments: Commercial, Consumer, and Other. We regularly evaluate the appropriateness of our reportable segments, particularly in light of organizational changes, merger and acquisition activity and changing laws and regulations. Therefore, these reportable segments may change in the future. Our Commercial and Consumer segments both offer a diversified mix of managed care products, including preferred provider organizations, or PPOs; health maintenance organizations, or HMOs; traditional indemnity benefits and point-of-service plans, or POS plans; and a variety of hybrid benefit plans including consumer-driven health plans, or CDHPs, hospital only and limited benefit products. Our Commercial segment includes Local Group (including UniCare), National Accounts and certain other ancillary business operations (dental, vision, life and disability and workers’ compensation). Business units in the Commercial segment offer fully-insured products and provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers, including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management, disease management, wellness programs and other administrative services. Our Commercial segment also includes the operations of our 1-800 CONTACTS, Inc., or 1-800 CONTACTS, business, which was acquired on June 20, 2012 and whose results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements for the period following the acquisition date. Our Consumer segment includes Senior, State-Sponsored and Individual businesses. Senior business includes services such as Medicare Advantage (including private fee-for-service plans and special needs plans), Medicare Part D, and Medicare Supplement, while State-Sponsored business includes our managed care alternatives through publicly funded health care programs, including Medicaid, state Children’s Health Insurance Programs, or CHIP, and Medicaid expansion programs (including those programs managed by AMERIGROUP Corporation, or Amerigroup, which was acquired on December 24, 2012 and whose results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements for the period following the acquisition date). Individual business includes individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. Our Other segment includes the Comprehensive Health Solutions business unit, or CHS, that brings together our resources focused on optimizing the quality of health care, the clinical consumer experience and cost of care management. CHS includes provider relations, care and disease management, employee assistance programs, including behavioral health, radiology benefit management and analytics-driven, evidence-based personal health care guidance. Our Other segment also contains results from our Federal Government Solutions, or FGS, business. FGS business includes services to the Federal Government in connection with the Federal Employee Program, or FEP, and National Government Services, Inc., or NGS, which acts as a Medicare contractor in several regions across the nation. The Other segment also includes other businesses that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, guidance for disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information, as well as intersegment sales and expense eliminations and corporate expenses not allocated to the other reportable segments. 43 Table of Contents Our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue comes from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. Administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, or where the fee is based on either processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized. Additionally, we earn administrative fee revenues from our Medicare processing business and from other health-related businesses including disease management programs. Other revenue primarily includes ocular product sales by 1-800 CONTACTS. Our benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. While we offer a diversified mix of managed care products, including PPO, HMO, POS and CDHP products, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products. We classify certain claims-related costs as benefit expense to reflect costs incurred for our members’ traditional medical care, as well as those expenses which improve our members’ health and medical outcomes. These claims-related costs may be comprised of expenses incurred for: (i) medical management, including case and utilization management; (ii) health and wellness, including disease management services for such things as diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, congestive heart failure and asthma management and wellness initiatives like weight-loss programs and smoking cessation treatments; and (iii) clinical health policy. These types of claims-related costs are designed to ultimately lower our members’ cost of care. Our selling expense consists of external broker commission expenses, and generally varies with premium or membership volume. Our general and administrative expense consists of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Other costs are variable or discretionary in nature. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium, but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels, and thus associate compensation expense. Examples of discretionary costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity. Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management and health and wellness programs. Several economic factors related to health care costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating health care costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers and any regulatory or market driven restrictions on our ability to obtain adequate premium rates to offset overall inflation in health care costs, including increases in unit costs and utilization resulting from the aging of the population and other demographics, as well as advances in medical technology, may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material impact on our results of operations. Our future results of operations will also be impacted by certain external forces and resulting changes in our business model and strategy. In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed and the President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, as well as the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or HCERA, or collectively, Health Care Reform, which represents significant changes to the U.S. health 44 Table of Contents care system. The legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage over time by increasing the eligibility thresholds for most state Medicaid programs and providing certain other individuals and small businesses with tax credits to subsidize a portion of the cost of health insurance coverage. The legislation includes a requirement that most individuals obtain health insurance coverage beginning in 2014 and also a requirement that certain large employers offer coverage to their employees or pay a financial penalty. In addition, the new laws include certain new taxes and fees, including an excise tax on high premium insurance policies (which becomes effective in 2017), limitations on the amount of compensation that is tax deductible and new fees on companies in our industry, some of which will not be deductible for income tax purposes. The legislation also imposes new regulations on the health insurance sector, including, but not limited to, guaranteed coverage requirements, prohibitions on some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to our members, increased restrictions on rescinding coverage, establishment of minimum medical loss ratio requirements, a requirement to cover preventive services on a first dollar basis, the establishment of state insurance exchanges and essential benefit packages and greater limitations on how we price certain of our products. The legislation also reduces the reimbursement levels for health plans participating in the Medicare Advantage program over time. As a result of Health Care Reform, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, issued medical loss ratio, or MLR, regulations that require us to meet minimum MLR thresholds for large group, small group and individual lines of business. For purposes of determining MLR rebates, HHS has defined the types of costs that should be included in the MLR rebate calculation. This definition varied from our prior classification under GAAP. Where appropriate, we have adopted this revised classification effective January 1, 2011 to further align our GAAP basis benefit expense to that used in the calculation for determining MLR rebates under HHS guidance. Prior period amounts were not reclassified due to immateriality. However, certain components of the MLR calculation as defined by HHS cannot be classified consistently under GAAP. While considered benefit expense or a reduction of premium revenue by HHS, certain of these costs are classified as other types of expense, such as income tax expense or selling, general and administrative expense, in our GAAP basis financial statements. Accordingly, the benefit expense ratio determined using our consolidated GAAP operating results is not comparable to the MLR calculated under HHS regulations. These and other provisions of Health Care Reform are likely to have significant effects on our future operations, which, in turn, could impact the value of our business model and results of operations, including potential impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets. We will continue to evaluate the impact of Health Care Reform as additional guidance is made available. For additional discussion regarding Health Care Reform, see Part I, Item 1 “Business—Regulation” and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies may further restrict our ability to obtain new product approvals, implement changes in premium rates or impose additional restrictions, under new or existing laws that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to external forces discussed in the preceding paragraphs, our results of operations are impacted by levels and mix of membership. In recent years, we experienced membership declines due to unfavorable economic conditions driving increased unemployment. We expect unemployment levels will remain relatively high throughout 2013, which will likely impact our ability to maintain current membership levels. In addition, we believe the self-insured portion of our group membership base will continue to increase as a percentage of total group membership. These membership trends could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Also see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. The National Organization of Life & Health Insurance Guaranty Associations, or NOLHGA, is a voluntary association consisting of the state life and health insurance guaranty organizations located throughout the U.S. State life and health insurance guaranty associations, working together with NOLHGA, provide a safety net for 45 Table of Contents their state’s policyholders, ensuring that they continue to receive coverage even if their insurer is declared insolvent. We are aware that the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner, or Insurance Commissioner, has placed Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary American Network Insurance Company, or collectively Penn Treaty, in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency. The state court denied the Insurance Commissioner’s petition for the liquidation of Penn Treaty and ordered the Commissioner to file an updated plan of rehabilitation. The Insurance Commissioner has filed a Notice of Appeal asking the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to reverse the order denying the liquidation petition. In the event rehabilitation of Penn Treaty is unsuccessful and Penn Treaty is declared insolvent and placed in liquidation, we and other insurers may be required to pay a portion of their policyholder claims through state guaranty association assessments in future periods. Given the uncertainty around whether Penn Treaty will ultimately be declared insolvent and, if so, the amount of the insolvency, the amount and timing of any associated future guaranty fund assessments and the availability and amount of any potential premium tax and other offsets, we currently cannot estimate our net exposure, if any, to this potential insolvency. We will continue to monitor the situation and may record a liability and expense in future reporting periods, which could be material to our cash flows and results of operations. Executive Summary We are one of the largest health benefits companies in terms of medical membership in the United States, serving 36.1 medical members through our affiliated health plans and a total of 66.5 individuals through all subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or BCBS, licensee for: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (as BCBS in 10 New York City metropolitan and surrounding counties, and as Blue Cross or BCBS in selected upstate counties only), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, or Empire Blue Cross (in our New York service areas). We conduct business as Amerigroup in Texas, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, Ohio, New Mexico, Louisiana and Washington, and beginning January 1, 2013 Amerigroup conducts business in Kansas. We also serve customers throughout the country as UniCare and in certain California, Arizona, Nevada, New York and Virginia markets through our CareMore Health Group, Inc., or CareMore, subsidiary. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states through our subsidiaries. We also sell contact lenses, eyeglasses and other ocular products through our 1-800 CONTACTS business. Operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $60,728.5, an increase of $863.3, or 1.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily reflecting higher premium revenue in our Consumer segment, partially offset by lower premium revenue in our Commercial segment. The higher premium revenue in our Consumer segment primarily resulted from membership growth in our Senior Medicare Advantage business and growth in our State-Sponsored business, primarily in the California market, as well as revenue from Amerigroup’s operations during the post-acquisition period. The premium revenue decrease in our Commercial segment was driven primarily by fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business resulting from strategic product portfolio changes in certain markets, competitive pressure in certain markets and unfavorable economic conditions, partially offset by premium rate increases in our Local Group business designed to cover overall cost trends. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $2,655.5, an increase of $8.8, or 0.3%, from the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in net income was primarily driven by the favorable income tax expense impact from a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and improved operating results in our Commercial segment, partially offset by lower operating results in our Consumer and Other segments. Our fully-diluted earnings per share, or EPS, for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $8.18, an increase of $0.93, or 12.8%, from the year ended December 31, 2011. Our fully-diluted shares for the year ended 46 Table of Contents December 31, 2012 were 324.8, a decrease of 40.3, or 11.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in EPS resulted primarily from the lower number of shares outstanding in 2012 due to share buyback activity under our share repurchase program and, to a lesser extent, the increase in net income described above. Our results of operations discussed throughout this MD&A are determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. We also calculate adjusted net income, adjusted EPS and operating gain, which are non-GAAP measures, to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results and comparing them among periods. Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS exclude realized gains and losses on investments, other-than-temporary losses on investments recognized in income, impairment of other intangible assets and certain other items, if applicable, that we do not consider a part of our core operating results. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, selling, general and administrative expense and cost of products. We use these measures as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and forecasting future operating periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income before income tax expense, net income or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional details on operating gain, see our “Reportable Segments Results of Operations” discussion included in this MD&A. The table below reconciles net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP to adjusted net income and adjusted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Years EndedDecember 31 Change % Change 2012 2011 Net income $ 2,655.5 $ 2,646.7 $ 8.8 0.3 % Less: Net realized gains on investments 334.9 235.1 99.8 Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments (37.8 ) (93.3 ) 55.5 Litigation related costs (24.0 ) — (24.0 ) Acquisition and integration related costs (106.4 ) — (106.4 ) Income tax settlements 140.1 — 140.1 Tax effect of adjustments (107.4 ) (49.6 ) (57.8 ) Adjusted net income $ 2,456.1 $ 2,554.5 $ (98.4 ) (3.9 )% EPS $ 8.18 $ 7.25 $ 0.93 12.8 % Less: Net realized gains on investments 1.03 0.64 0.39 Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments (0.11 ) (0.26 ) 0.15 Litigation related costs (0.07 ) — (0.07 ) Acquisition and integration related costs (0.33 ) — (0.33 ) Income tax settlements 0.43 — 0.43 Tax effect of adjustments (0.33 ) (0.13 ) (0.20 ) Adjusted EPS $ 7.56 $ 7.00 $ 0.56 8.0 % Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $2,744.6, or 1.0 times net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $3,374.4, or 1.3 times net income. The decrease in operating cash flow from 2011 of $629.8 was driven primarily by payments related to the run-out of medical claims for former members, net cash outflows by our Amerigroup subsidiary during the post-acquisition period (including claims payments, change-in-control payments and payments for transaction costs), increased litigation settlement payments and the addition of required minimum MLR rebate payments in 2012 (which were established as liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2011). 47 Table of Contents We intend to expand through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and efficient use of capital in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. While we have achieved strong growth as a result of strategic mergers and acquisitions, we have also achieved organic growth in our existing markets over time by providing excellent service, offering competitively priced products and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks. Significant Transactions The more significant transactions that have occurred over the last three years that have impacted or will impact our capital structure or that have or will influence how we conduct our business operations include: • Acquisition of Amerigroup and the related debt issuance (2012) • Acquisition of 1-800 CONTACTS (2012) • Use of Capital—Board of Directors declaration of dividends on common stock (2012 and 2011) and authorization for repurchases of our common stock (2012 and prior) • Acquisition of CareMore (2011) For additional information regarding these transactions, see Note 3, “Business Combinations,” and Note 15, “Capital Stock,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, included in this Form 10-K. Membership Our medical membership includes seven different customer types: Local Group, Individual, National Accounts, BlueCard® , Senior, State-Sponsored and FEP. BCBS-branded business generally refers to members in our service areas licensed by the BCBSA. Non-BCBS-branded business includes Amerigroup and CareMore members as well as UniCare members predominantly outside of our BCBSA service areas. • Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. In addition, Local Group includes UniCare local group members. These groups are generally sold through brokers or consultants working with industry specialists from our in-house sales force. Local Group insurance premiums may be based on claims incurred by the group or sold on a self-insured basis. The customer’s buying decision is typically based upon the size and breadth of our networks, customer service, the quality of our medical management services, the administrative cost included in our quoted price, our financial stability, reputation and our ability to effectively service large complex accounts. Local Group accounted for 40.5%, 44.4% and 45.7% of our medical members at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. • National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in a WellPoint service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker relationships. Service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. National Accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. We have a significant advantage when competing for very large National Accounts due to the size and breadth of our networks and our ability to access the national provider networks of BCBS companies and take advantage of their provider discounts in their local markets. National Accounts represented 19.4%, 21.6% and 21.1% of our medical members at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 48 Table of Contents • BlueCard® host customers represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by WellPoint who receive health care services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard® membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard® program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-WellPoint controlled BCBSA licensee (i.e., the “home plan”). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard® members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard® members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard® claims received per month. BlueCard® host membership accounted for 13.9%, 14.4% and 14.1% of our medical members at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. • Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 (including UniCare) and their covered dependents. Individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, our in-house sales force or via the Internet. Individual business is sold on a fully-insured basis and is usually medically underwritten at the point of initial issuance. Individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network, and the efficiency of administration. Account turnover is generally higher with Individual as compared to Local Groups. Individual business accounted for 5.1%, 5.4% and 5.7% of our medical members at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. • Senior customers are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a managed care alternative for the Medicare program, who have purchased Medicare Supplement benefit coverage, some disabled under 65, or all ages with End Stage Renal Disease. Medicare Supplement policies are sold to Medicare recipients as supplements to the benefits they receive from the Medicare program. Rates are filed with and in some cases approved by state insurance departments. Most of the premium for Medicare Advantage is paid directly by the Federal government on behalf of the participant who may also be charged a small premium. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. Senior business accounted for 4.3%, 4.3% and 3.8% of our medical members at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. • State-Sponsored membership represents eligible members who receive health care benefits through publicly funded health care programs, including Medicaid, CHIP and Medicaid expansion programs. Total State-Sponsored program business accounted for 12.6%, 5.5% and 5.3% of our medical members at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. • FEP members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. FEP business accounted for 4.2%, 4.4% and 4.3% of our medical members at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two principal funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some self-funded customers choose to purchase stop-loss coverage to limit their retained risk. 49 Table of Contents The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Also included below is other membership by product. The medical membership and other membership presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

Fully-insured membership increased 2,209, or 16.1%, primarily due to State-Sponsored membership acquired with the acquisition of Amerigroup and growth in our Senior membership, partially offset by membership losses in certain Local Group markets resulting primarily from strategic product portfolio changes and heightened competition. Local Group membership decreased 578, or 3.8%, primarily due to increased competition, strategic product portfolio changes in the New York market and network rental markets and negative in-group change. Individual membership increased 9, or 0.5%, primarily due to an overall improved competitive position in our California market. National Accounts membership decreased 402, or 5.4%, primarily driven by pricing increases in our self-funded National Accounts business and negative in-group change. BlueCard® membership increased 81, or 1.6%, primarily due to favorable net sales and in-group change at other BCBSA plans whose members reside in or travel to our licensed areas. Senior membership increased 74, or 5.0%, primarily due to strong sales during the open enrollment period resulting from our geographic expansion into several new counties, partially offset by the withdrawal of the California Regional PPO Medicare Advantage product. State-Sponsored membership increased 2,694, or 144.3%, primarily due to 2,662 members acquired with the acquisition of Amerigroup and growth in Wisconsin, California and Kansas, partially offset by exiting selected markets. FEP membership increased 1, or 0.1%, primarily due to favorable in-group change. Other Membership & Customers (in thousands) Our Other products are often ancillary to our health business, and can therefore be impacted by corresponding changes in our medical membership. Behavioral health membership decreased 979, or 3.9%, primarily due to the overall declines in our fully-insured medical membership and negative in-group change. Life and disability membership decreased 174, or 3.5%, primarily due to the overall declines in our Commercial fully-insured medical membership and negative in-group change. Life and disability products are generally offered as part of Commercial medical fully-insured membership sales. Dental membership decreased 219, or 5.4%, primarily due to the lapse of a large dental contract, partially offset by the launch of new dental products in 2012. Dental administration membership decreased 59, or 1.4%, primarily due to the lapse of a large contract pursuant to which we provided dental administrative services. Vision membership increased 736, or 19.5%, primarily due to strong sales and positive in-group change in our National Accounts, Local Group and Senior businesses. 51 Table of Contents Medicare Advantage Part D membership increased 47, or 8.2%, primarily due to strong sales during the open enrollment period resulting from our geographic expansion into several new counties, partially offset by our withdrawal of the California Regional PPO Medicare Advantage product. Medicare Part D standalone membership decreased 93, or 13.9%, primarily due to competitive pressure in certain markets. Retail vision customers increased 3,130 due to our acquisition of 1-800 CONTACTS. December 31, 2011 Compared to December 31, 2010 Medical Membership (in thousands) During the year ended December 31, 2011, total medical membership increased 928, or 2.8%, primarily due to increases in our National Accounts and BlueCard® membership, and to a lesser degree, increases in our Senior, State-Sponsored and FEP membership. In addition, a portion of the increase was attributable to new federal regulations associated with Health Care Reform requiring coverage of dependents up to age 26. These increases were partially offset by declines in our Individual and Local Group businesses. Self-funded medical membership increased 916, or 4.7%, primarily due to increases in self-funded National Account and Local Group membership resulting from additional sales and conversions from fully-insured to self-funded arrangements, partially offset by declines in self-funded non-BCBSA-branded business. Fully-insured membership increased 12, or 0.1%, primarily due to Senior Medicare Advantage, FEP and State-Sponsored membership increases, partially offset by conversions from fully-insured to self-funded arrangements and declines in Individual, National and Local Group fully-insured membership. Local Group membership decreased 4, or less than 1.0%, primarily due to membership declines in our non-BCBSA-branded membership, nearly offset by increases in BCBSA-branded membership due to new sales. National Accounts membership increased 372, or 5.3%, primarily driven by additional sales reflective of our extensive and cost-effective provider networks and a broad and innovative product portfolio. In addition, the new federal regulations requiring coverage of dependents up to age 26 also contributed to the increase. BlueCard® membership increased 224, or 4.8%, primarily due to increased utilization by other BCBSA licensee members who reside in or travel to our licensed areas. Individual membership decreased 59, or 3.1%, primarily due to a decline in BCBSA-branded business resulting from competitive pressures and delayed product approvals for new Health Care Reform compliant products in California. Senior membership increased 212, or 16.8%, primarily due to increases in our Medicare Advantage plans, including additional Medicare Advantage membership resulting from our acquisition of CareMore, and to a lesser extent, increases in our Medicare Supplement membership. State-Sponsored membership increased 111, or 6.3%, primarily due to growth in Indiana, South Carolina, Kansas and California. FEP membership increased 72, or 5.0%, primarily due to new federal regulations requiring coverage of dependents up to age 26. 52 Table of Contents Other Membership & Customers (in thousands) Our Other products are often ancillary to our health business, and can therefore be impacted by corresponding changes in our medical membership. Behavioral health membership increased 1,172, or 4.9%, primarily due to new sales to several major accounts in our National Accounts business, increased Medicare Advantage and State-Sponsored medical membership and a change in methodology of how we report certain portions of the behavioral health membership. Life and disability membership decreased 189, or 3.6%, primarily due to lapses in our National Accounts business. Life and disability products are generally offered as a part of Commercial medical fully-insured membership sales. Dental membership increased 39, or 1.0%, primarily due to new sales resulting from the introduction of new product offerings and, to a lesser extent, our acquisition of a dental benefits plan in December 2011. Dental administration membership decreased 110, or 2.6%, primarily due to the termination of a contract in the North Carolina market. Vision membership increased 275, or 7.8%, primarily due to strong sales and market penetration of our Blue View vision product within the Local Group markets and embedding of vision benefits in certain of our Consumer products, partially offset by lapses. Medicare Advantage Part D membership increased 141, or 32.5%, primarily due to new membership associated with the increase in our Medicare Advantage medical membership, including additional Medicare Advantage medical membership resulting from our acquisition of CareMore. Medicare Part D standalone membership decreased 147, or 18.1%, primarily due to lapses in Low Income Subsidy, or LIS, membership in 2011. LIS is a Medicare Part D program that provides additional premium and cost-sharing assistance to qualifying Medicare beneficiaries with low incomes and/or limited resources. Cost of Care The following discussion summarizes our aggregate underlying cost of care trends for the year ended December 31, 2012 for our Local Group fully-insured business only. Our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing the year-over-year change in average per member per month claim costs, including member co-payments and deductibles. While our cost of care trend varies by geographic location, based on underlying medical cost trends, we estimate that our aggregate cost of care trend was near the low end of 7.0% plus or minus 50 basis points for the full year of 2012. Overall, our medical cost trend is driven by unit cost. Inpatient hospital trend was in the mid-to-high single digit range and was primarily related to increases in the average cost per admission. While provider rate increases are a primary driver of unit cost trends, we continually negotiate with hospitals to manage these cost trends. We remain committed to optimizing our reimbursement rates and strategies to help address the cost pressures faced by employers and consumers. Both inpatient admission counts per thousand members and inpatient day counts per thousand members were only slightly higher than the prior year. The average length of stay was relatively the same as the prior year. In addition to our recontracting efforts, a number of clinical management initiatives are in place to help mitigate the inpatient trend. Focused review efforts continue in key areas, including inpatient behavioral health stays and spinal surgery cases, among others. Additionally, we continue to refine our programs related to readmission management, focused utilization management at high cost facilities and post-discharge follow-up care. 53 Table of Contents Outpatient trend was in the high single digit range and was 70% unit cost related and 30% utilization related. Outpatient costs are a collection of different types of expenses, such as outpatient facilities, labs, x-rays, emergency room, occupational therapy and physical therapy. Per visit costs are still the largest contributor to overall outpatient trend, influenced largely by price increases within certain provider contracts. Outpatient utilization (visits per thousand members) was higher than the prior year. We continue to work with vendors and providers to help optimize site of service decisions, including in key areas such as emergency room, lab, radiology, sleep studies and surgery settings. As an example, we executed on our American Imaging Management’s Sleep Management Program in the fourth quarter of 2012 in certain of our central and western states, as well as in Georgia, and in the first quarter of 2013 in New York and the other northeastern states. The program aligns the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea with clinical guidelines based on widely accepted medical literature, while at the same time enhancing member access to high value providers and ensuring treatment compliance for the continuing payment for equipment rental and ongoing supplies. Programs like this, along with continued expansion and optimization of our utilization management programs, are acting to moderate trend. Physician services trend was in the mid single digit range and was 75% unit cost related and 25% utilization related. Increases in the physician care category were partially driven by contracting changes. We continue to collaborate with physicians to improve quality of care through pay-for-performance programs and bundled payment initiatives. Additionally, we continue to enhance our ability to detect and deter fraud and abuse, reducing waste in the system. Pharmacy trend was in the mid single digit range and was driven primarily by unit cost (cost per prescription). Continued inflation in the average wholesale price of drugs applied upward pressure to the overall cost per prescription as did the increasing cost of specialty drugs. The increase in cost per prescription measures continued to be mitigated by improvements in our generic usage rates and benefit plan design changes. We are continuously evaluating our drug formulary to ensure the most effective pharmaceutical therapies are available to our members. In response to cost trends, we continue to pursue contracting and plan design changes, promote and implement performance-based contracts that reward clinical outcomes and quality, and expand our radiology management, disease management and advanced care management programs. We are taking a leadership role in the area of payment reform as evidenced by the introduction of the Patient Centered Primary Care program. By establishing the primary care doctor as central to the coordination of a patient’s health care needs, the initiative builds on the success of current patient-centered medical home programs in helping to improve patient care while lowering costs. Additionally, our value-based contracting initiative continues to underscore our commitment to partnering with providers to improve quality and lower cost. As evidenced by our expansion of CareMore into select New York and Virginia markets, we remain committed to providing access-based health care products and services that are simple to use and that customers can trust. CareMore’s mission is to improve the overall lives and wellbeing of seniors by providing innovative, focused health care approaches to the complex problems of aging, while protecting the financial resources of seniors and the Medicare Program. CareMore’s model is focused on disease management programs that provide Medicare members with a hands-on approach to care coordination and intensive treatment of chronic conditions. 54 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Our consolidated summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are discussed in the following section.

Premiums for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $56,496.7, $55,969.6 and $53,973.6, respectively, and are included in Total operating revenue presented above. 3 bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1% 4 Selling, general and administrative expense ratio = Selling, general and administrative expense ÷ Total operating revenue Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2011 Total operating revenue increased $863.3, or 1.4%, to $60,728.5 in 2012, resulting primarily from higher premium revenue and, to a lesser extent, increased other revenue and administrative fees. The higher premium revenue was due primarily to membership growth in our Senior Medicare Advantage business, including CareMore, and growth in our State-Sponsored business, primarily in the California market, as well as revenue 55 Table of Contents from Amerigroup’s operations during the post-acquisition period. In addition, premium rate increases in our Local Group and Individual businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and increased reimbursement in our FEP business contributed to the increased premium revenue. These increases were partially offset by fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business resulting from strategic product portfolio changes in certain states, competitive pressure in certain markets and unfavorable economic conditions. The increase in other revenue resulted primarily from ocular product sales by our 1-800 CONTACTS business during the post-acquisition period. Administrative fees increased primarily as a result of pricing increases for self-funded members in our National Accounts and Local Group businesses, partially offset by membership declines in our self-funded National Accounts business. Net investment income decreased $17.6, or 2.5%, to $686.1 in 2012, primarily due to lower investment yields, partially offset by higher average cash and investment balances resulting from debt issuances in 2012, including the debt issuance related to our acquisition of Amerigroup. Net realized gains on investments, net of other-than-temporary impairment losses, increased $155.3, or 110%, to $297.1 in 2012, primarily due to increased gains on sales of fixed maturity securities and, to a lesser extent, decreased other-than-temporary impairment losses on equity securities as a result of improved market conditions. Benefit expense increased $566.1, or 1.2%, to $48,213.6 in 2012, primarily due to increases in our Senior and State-Sponsored businesses, partially offset by decreases in our Local Group business. The increase in our Senior business was driven primarily by membership growth in our Medicare Advantage business, including CareMore, while the increase in our State-Sponsored business was driven by both increased benefit cost trends and membership growth, including membership acquired with the acquisition of Amerigroup. These increases were partially offset by the fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business as described above, as well as favorable prior year reserve development in 2012 compared to modest reserve strengthening in 2011. Our benefit expense ratio increased 20 basis points to 85.3% in 2012, primarily due to higher medical costs in our State-Sponsored business, primarily in California. The benefit expense ratio increase was partially offset by improvements in our Local Group and Senior businesses and the favorable prior year reserve development. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $302.7, or 3.6%, to $8,738.3 in 2012, primarily due to additional selling, general and administrative expense related to CareMore, acquisition and integration related expenses associated with Amerigroup and 1-800 CONTACTS, and the impairment of certain software assets, partially offset by lower employee incentive compensation costs. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio increased 30 basis points to 14.4% in 2012, primarily due to the increased selling, general and administrative expense discussed in the preceding paragraph, partially offset by increased operating revenue. Cost of products totaled $137.4 in 2012 and represents the costs of ocular products sold by 1-800 CONTACTS during the post-acquisition period. Other expense increased $87.2, or 13.0%, to $756.9 in 2012, primarily due to increased interest expense resulting from higher outstanding debt balances and financing costs associated with our acquisition of Amerigroup. Income tax expense decreased $101.2, or 7.7%, to $1,210.0 in 2012, primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in 2012 and, to a lesser extent, lower income before income tax expense. The effective tax rates in 2012 and 2011 were 31.3% and 33.1%, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the impact from the 2012 settlement with the IRS of items related to not-for-profit conversions and corporate reorganizations in prior years, as well as issues related to certain of our acquired companies incurred prior to our acquisition of those 56 Table of Contents companies. This was partially offset by increases due to the impact of non-tax deductible litigation settlement expenses and an increase in our state deferred tax asset valuation allowance attributable to uncertainty associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards. Our net income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 10 basis points to 4.3% in 2012 as compared to 2011 as a result of all factors discussed above. Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Total operating revenue increased $2,124.7, or 3.7%, to $59,865.2 in 2011, primarily due to premium rate increases in our Local Group and Individual businesses designed to cover cost trends, increased fully-insured membership in our Senior Medicare Advantage business and increased reimbursement in the FEP business. These increases were partially offset by fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses resulting from the unfavorable economic conditions and the conversions of two large accounts from fully-insured to self-funded status in 2010. Administrative fees also increased due to higher self-funded membership in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses, including the impact of conversions from fully-insured to self-funded membership. Net investment income decreased $99.6, or 12.4%, to $703.7 in 2011, primarily due to lower yields on investment balances and a decline in dividend income from a cost method investment. Benefit expense increased $2,717.1, or 6.0%, to $47,647.5 in 2011, primarily due to higher medical costs in our Local Group business, higher Senior Medicare Advantage membership, adverse selection in certain Medicare Advantage products and increased membership in the FEP business. In addition, an estimated $247.0 of higher than anticipated favorable prior year reserve development and an estimated $67.7 of lower targeted margin for adverse deviation were recognized as reductions of benefit expense during 2010 with no comparable amounts recognized in 2011. The increases in benefit expense in 2011 were partially offset by fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses and the conversions of two large accounts from fully-insured to self-funded status in 2010. Our benefit expense ratio increased 190 basis points to 85.1% in 2011, primarily due to higher medical costs in our Senior, Local Group and State-Sponsored businesses, the reduced amount of favorable prior year reserve development between the two periods and the impact of minimum medical loss ratio requirements in 2011. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $297.0, or 3.4%, to $8,435.6 in 2011, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs, cost reductions associated with our ongoing efficiency initiatives and the non-recurrence of asset impairments, partially offset by increased premium tax expense, selling, general and administrative expenses associated with our CareMore subsidiary and increased advertising expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 100 basis points to 14.1% in 2011, primarily due to increased operating revenue and reduced selling, general and administrative expenses. Other expenses decreased $12.0, or 1.8%, to $669.7 in 2011, reflecting the non-recurrence of an impairment of other intangible assets and reduced amortization of certain other intangible assets acquired in prior years, partially offset by increased interest expense due to higher average outstanding debt balances. Income tax expense decreased $155.5, or 10.6%, to $1,311.2 in 2011, primarily due to lower income before income tax expense. The effective tax rates in 2011 and 2010 were 33.1% and 33.7%, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased primarily due to prior tax year federal and state audit settlements during 2011. Net income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 50 basis points to 4.4% in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of all factors discussed above. 57 Table of Contents Reportable Segments Results of Operations We use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, which currently are Commercial, Consumer and Other. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, selling, general and administrative expense and cost of products. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains/losses on investments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, impairment of other intangible assets or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. For additional information, including a reconciliation of consolidated operating gain to income before income taxes, see Note 20, “Segment Information,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 included in this Form 10-K. The discussion of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our Commercial, Consumer, and Other segments’ summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are as follows: Change Years Ended December 31 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ % $ % Commercial Operating revenue $ 33,553.5 $ 34,498.0 $ 34,559.3 $ (944.5 ) (2.7 ) $ (61.3 ) (0.2 ) Operating gain 3,199.7 3,090.5 3,085.7 109.2 3.5 4.8 0.2 Operating margin 9.5 % 9.0 % 8.9 % NA 1 50 bp NA 1 10 bp Consumer Operating revenue $ 19,427.7 $ 17,784.9 $ 16,092.6 $ 1,642.8 9.2 $ 1,692.3 10.5 Operating gain 440.2 623.1 1,000.6 (182.9 ) (29.4 ) (377.5 ) (37.7 ) Operating margin 2.3 % 3.5 % 6.2 % NA 1 (120 )bp NA 1 (270 )bp Other Operating revenue $ 7,747.3 $ 7,582.3 $ 7,088.6 $ 165.0 2.2 $ 493.7 7.0 Operating (loss) gain (0.7 ) 68.5 (8.8 ) (69.2 ) (101.0 ) 77.3 878.4 1 Not applicable Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2011 Commercial Operating revenue decreased $944.5, or 2.7%, to $33,553.5 in 2012, primarily due to fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group business resulting from strategic product portfolio changes in certain states, competitive pressure in certain markets and unfavorable economic conditions, partially offset by premium rate increases in our Local Group business designed to cover overall cost trends. Partially offsetting the decline in premium revenue was an increase in other revenue in our ancillary businesses resulting primarily from ocular product sales by 1-800 CONTACTS during the post-acquisition period and increased administrative fees resulting from pricing increases for self-funded members in our National Accounts and Local Group businesses. Operating gain increased $109.2, or 3.5%, to $3,199.7 in 2012, primarily due to an improved benefit expense ratio for our Local Group business, including the impact of favorable prior year reserve development in 2012 compared to modest reserve strengthening in 2011, as well as increased operating results in our ancillary businesses, including ocular product sales by 1-800 CONTACTS during the post-acquisition period. These 58 Table of Contents increases were partially offset by declines in our Local Group business due to fully-insured membership losses as a result of strategic product portfolio changes in certain markets, competitive pressure in certain markets and unfavorable economic conditions. The operating margin in 2012 was 9.5%, a 50 basis point increase from 2011, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Consumer Operating revenue increased $1,642.8, or 9.2%, to $19,427.7 in 2012, primarily due to membership growth in our Medicare Advantage business, including CareMore, and, to a lesser extent, growth in our State-Sponsored business resulting from retroactive premium rate increases in the California market as well as premium revenue from Amerigroup’s operations during the post-acquisition period. Operating gain decreased $182.9, or 29.4%, to $440.2 in 2012, primarily due to declines in our State-Sponsored and Individual businesses due to higher benefit cost trends and increased general and administrative expense resulting from transaction expenses associated with the Amerigroup acquisition and restructuring activities. The operating margin in 2012 was 2.3%, a 120 basis point decrease from 2011, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Other Operating revenue increased $165.0, or 2.2%, to $7,747.3 in 2012, primarily due to growth in our FEP business resulting from premium rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends during 2012. Operating gain decreased $69.2 to an operating loss of $0.7 in 2012, primarily due to increased unallocated general and administrative expense, including expenses related to restructuring activities, transaction expenses associated with the Amerigroup acquisition and litigation settlement expenses. Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Commercial Operating revenue decreased $61.3, or 0.2%, to $34,498.0 in 2011, primarily due to fully-insured membership declines in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses resulting from unfavorable economic conditions and the conversion of two large accounts from fully-insured to self-funded status. The decreases in premiums were partially offset by premium rate increases in our Local Group business designed to cover cost trends and increased administrative fees due to higher self-funded membership in our Local Group and National Accounts businesses. Operating gain increased $4.8, or 0.2%, to $3,090.5 in 2011, primarily due to improved results in our National Accounts business and lower selling, general and administrative expenses. These increases were partially offset by an estimated $180.0 of operating gain recognized in the Commercial segment during 2010 as a result of higher than anticipated favorable prior year reserve development and lower targeted margin for adverse deviation with no comparable amounts recognized in 2011 and the impact of minimum medical loss ratio requirements on 2011 operating gain. The operating margin in 2011 was 9.0%, a 10 basis point increase over 2010, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. 59 Table of Contents Consumer Operating revenue increased $1,692.3, or 10.5%, to $17,784.9 in 2011, primarily due to increases in our Senior and State-Sponsored businesses. The increase in Senior revenue was primarily due to increased Medicare Advantage membership, including increased membership resulting from our acquisition of CareMore, while the increase in State-Sponsored revenue reflected both increased pricing and membership. Operating gain decreased $377.5, or 37.7%, to $623.1 in 2011, primarily due to lower operating gain in our Senior Medicare Advantage business. This decline was a result of higher medical costs in 2011 due to increased membership and adverse selection in certain of our Medicare Advantage products. We have refined our Medicare Advantage product strategy and service areas for 2012. The higher than expected medical costs in 2011 were partially offset by higher than anticipated risk score revenue as a result of an improved risk score estimation process and lower selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, an estimated $135.0 of operating gain was recognized in the Consumer segment during 2010 as a result of higher than anticipated favorable prior year reserve development and lower targeted margin for adverse deviation with no comparable amounts recognized in 2011. The operating margin in 2011 was 3.5%, a 270 basis point decrease from 2010, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Other Operating revenue increased $493.7, or 7.0%, to $7,582.3 in 2011, primarily due to growth in the FEP business as FEP membership increased 5.0% during 2011. Operating gain increased $77.3 to $68.5 in 2011, primarily due to growth in the FEP business and lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider our most important accounting policies that require significant estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our other significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, included in this Form 10-K. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. Medical Claims Payable The most subjective accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2012, this liability was $6,174.5 and represented 17.6% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 95.5%, or $5,897.9, of our total medical claims liability as of 60 Table of Contents December 31, 2012; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 4.5%, or $276.6, of the total medical claims payable as of December 31, 2012. The level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period end to the next, from 1% to 5% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made. Liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be appropriate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or “trend factors.” Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison of prior year, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense. We regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable. While there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid claims liability as of December 31, 2012 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by other operational variables including system changes, provider submission patterns and business combinations. 61 Table of Contents There is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through twelve months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. In our analysis for the claim liabilities at December 31, 2012, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 40 and 90 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower variability ranging from 0 to 30 basis points. The difference in completion factor assumptions, assuming moderately adverse experience, results in variability of 2%, or approximately $143.0, in the December 31, 2012 incurred but not paid claims liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein. The other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2012 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. In our analysis for the period ended December 31, 2012, there was a 300 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors assuming moderately adverse experience. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 4%, or approximately $276.0, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factors used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claims liability at December 31, 2012. See Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 included in this Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year.” Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. Further, while we believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for unpaid claims liability at each reporting date, starting in 2010 we began using a lower level of targeted margin for adverse deviation, which resulted in a benefit to 2010 income before taxes of $67.7. The ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 89.1% for 2012, 88.8% for 2011 and 89.6% for 2010. The increase in 2012 reflects acceleration in processing claims that occurred in 2012 due to higher levels of automatic claims adjudication and faster claims payment. The decline in 2011 reflects the impact of processing a claims inventory backlog that accumulated at the end of 2010. We calculate the percentage of prior years’ redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior years’ net incurred claims payable less prior years’ redundancies in the current period in order to demonstrate the development of the prior years’ reserves. This metric was 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2012. This metric was 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 15.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 reflect a lower level of targeted reserve for adverse deviation and a resultant lower level of prior years’ redundancies than the year ended December 31, 2010. We calculate the percentage of prior years’ redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior years’ net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation measure indicates the reasonableness of 62 Table of Contents our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims and the consistency in our methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2012, this metric was 1.1%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $513.6. This metric was 0.5% for 2011 and 1.5% for 2010. The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 included in this Form 10-K, for each of 2011 and 2010 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims – current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims – prior years redundancies” for the immediately following year): Years Ended December 31 2011 2010 Total net incurred medical claims, as reported $ 47,071.9 $ 44,359.1 Retrospective basis, as described above 46,768.0 44,867.4 Variance $ 303.9 $ (508.3 ) Variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported 0.6 % (1.1 )% Given that our business is primarily short tailed (which means that medical claims are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider), the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2012 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2013. The 2011 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of 0.6% was smaller in absolute value than the 2010 percentage of (1.1)%. The 2011 variance was driven by the higher level of prior year redundancies in 2012 associated with 2011 claim payments. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with FASB guidance, which requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance. At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following: • the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset; • the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim; • the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and • any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences. We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, 63 Table of Contents we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits, as required by the guidance. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted. In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we intend to defend our positions vigorously through the federal, state and local appeals processes. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact on our results of operations from these matters. For additional information, see Note 8, “Income Taxes,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, included in this Form 10-K. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2012 was $17,510.5 and other intangible assets were $9,102.8. The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets represented 45.1% of our total consolidated assets and 111.8% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2012. We follow FASB guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, which include goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately. We complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. These tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Certain interim impairment tests are also performed during interim periods when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur. Fair value is estimated using the income and market approaches for goodwill at the reporting unit level and the income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. Use of the income and market approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. The income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. These estimated future cash flows are then discounted. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted-average cost of capital. Market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including membership, revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry. We did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2012 annual impairment tests. However, as a result of certain provisions of Health Care Reform, along with current economic conditions resulting in high unemployment rates, we have experienced lower operating margins in certain lines of business. Those margins could become further compressed if unemployment levels remain high and as the more significant components of Health Care Reform become effective on January 1, 2014. As a result, the estimated fair values of certain of our 64 Table of Contents reporting units with goodwill could fall below their carrying values and we may be required to record impairment losses in future periods. While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income. For additional information, see Note 10, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, included in this Form 10-K. Investments Current and long-term available-for-sale investment securities were $18,586.9 at December 31, 2012 and represented 31.5% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2012. We classify fixed maturity and equity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” or “trading” and report those securities at fair value. Certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity. We review investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. In addition, for equity securities, we determine whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time to allow for a recovery of its fair value above its carrying amount. If any declines of equity securities are determined to be other-than-temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made. Certain FASB other-than-temporary impairment, or FASB OTTI, guidance applies to fixed maturity securities and provides guidance on the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments. In addition, this FASB OTTI guidance requires disclosures related to other-than-temporary impairments. If a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and is recorded to other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income in our consolidated income statements. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, the credit component of the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income in our consolidated statements of income and the non-credit component of the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in other comprehensive income. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment is determined by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present 65 Table of Contents value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of acquisition. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other debt securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings, and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default. We have a committee of certain accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. The current economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. This could result in other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments being charged against future income. Given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional, material other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments may be recorded in future periods. In addition to available-for-sale investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $1,387.7, or 2.4% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2012. These long-term investments consisted primarily of real estate, cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and certain other equity method investments. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term. Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage the market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits on investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future earnings and financial position. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $17,344.4 at December 31, 2012. The weighted-average credit rating of these securities was “A” as of December 31, 2012. Included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions and mortgage-backed securities of $2,029.5 and $16.9, respectively, that are guaranteed by third parties. With the exception of eleven securities with a fair value of $16.9, these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2012 with a guarantee by a third party. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities without the guarantee was “AA” as of December 31, 2012 for the securities for which such information is available. Fair values of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with FASB guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. We have controls in place to review the third party pricing services’ qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. In addition, we periodically review the third party pricing services’ pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable. We obtain only one quoted price for each security from third party pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. For securities not actively traded, the third party pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used 66 Table of Contents in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform monthly analysis on the prices received from third parties to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes a review of month-to-month price fluctuations. If unusual fluctuations are noted in this review, we may obtain additional information from other pricing services to validate the quoted price. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from third party pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. In certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. Such securities are designated Level III in accordance with FASB guidance. Securities designated Level III at December 31, 2012 totaled $155.5 and represented less than 1% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level III securities primarily consisted of certain inverse floating rate securities, structured securities, and municipal bonds that were thinly traded or not traded at all due to concerns in the securities markets and the resulting lack of liquidity. Consequently, observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using internal estimates for inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in this Form 10-K, and Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” Note 5, “Investments,” and Note 7, “Fair Value,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, included in this Form 10-K. Retirement Benefits Pension Benefits We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for some of our employees. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FASB guidance for retirement benefits, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by the guidance, we calculate the value of plan assets as described below. Further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods. An important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our December 31, 2012 measurement date, we selected a weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.66%, compared with our prior year assumption of 8.00%. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and an average of historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase. This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date (December 31, 2012). The selected weighted-average 67 Table of Contents discount rate was 3.60%, which was developed using a yield curve approach. Using yields available on high-quality fixed maturity securities with various maturity dates, the yield curve approach provides a “customized” rate, which is meant to match the expected cash flows of our specific benefit plans. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with the FASB guidance. In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities, equity securities and alternative investments across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow. Other Postretirement Benefits We provide most associates with certain medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits. At our December 31, 2012 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 3.71% (compared to a discount rate of 4.36% at the December 31, 2011 measurement date). We developed this rate using a yield curve approach as described above. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of pre-Medicare (those who are not currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2012 measurement date was 8.00% for 2013 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2025. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of post-Medicare (those who are currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2012 measurement date was 6.00% for 2013 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2021. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2012 by $47.1 and would increase service and interest costs by $2.4. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by $40.2 as of December 31, 2012 and would decrease service and interest costs by $2.0. For additional information regarding our retirement benefits, see Note 11, “Retirement Benefits,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, included in this Form 10-K. New Accounting Pronouncements For information regarding new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended December 31, 2012 that had, or are expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures, see the “New Accounting Pronouncements” section of Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Liquidity and Capital Resources Introduction Our cash receipts result primarily from premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from exercise of stock options. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, 68 Table of Contents taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock, capital expenditures and the payment of shareholder cash dividends. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have some negative impact on our liquidity. We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy. A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. The securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility, although current market conditions are more stable. During recent years, the Federal Government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to restore liquidity in the financial markets and to help relieve the credit crisis and strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. In addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide liquidity and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions. We have a $2,500.0 commercial paper program. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we intend to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our $2,000.0 senior revolving credit facility to redeem our commercial paper when it matures. While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we believe the lenders participating in our credit facility will be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. In addition to the $2,000.0 senior revolving credit facility, we estimate that we will receive approximately $2,284.0 of dividends from our subsidiaries during 2013, which also provides further operating and financial flexibility. The table below outlines the cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010: Years Ended December 31 2012 2011 2010 Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,744.6 $ 3,374.4 $ 1,416.7 Investing activities (4,551.6 ) (942.0 ) (1,271.5 ) Financing activities 2,088.9 (2,019.2 ) (3,169.3 ) Effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 1.1 (0.4 ) (3.2 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 283.0 $ 412.8 $ (3,027.3 ) Liquidity— Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 During the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $2,744.6, compared to $3,374.4 for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $629.8. This decrease was driven primarily by payments related to the run-out of medical claims for former members, net operating cash outflows 69 Table of Contents by our Amerigroup subsidiary during the post-acquisition period (including claims payments, change-in-control payments and payments for transaction costs), increased litigation settlement payments and the addition of required minimum medical loss ratio rebate payments in 2012 (which were established as liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2011). Net cash flow used in investing activities was $4,551.6 during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $942.0 for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in cash flow used in investing activities of $3,609.6 between the two periods primarily resulted from an increase in the purchase of subsidiaries, reflecting the acquisitions of Amerigroup and 1-800 CONTACTS during 2012, and an increase in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by changes in securities lending collateral and an increase in the net proceeds from the sales of investments. Net cash flow provided by financing activities was $2,088.9 during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to net cash flow used in financing activities of $2,019.2 for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in cash flow provided by financing activities of $4,108.1 primarily resulted from an increase in net proceeds from long-term borrowings and a decrease in common stock repurchases, partially offset by changes in bank overdrafts, changes in securities lending payable and a decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 During the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $3,374.4, compared to $1,416.7 for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $1,957.7. This increase resulted primarily from tax payments of $1,208.0 to the IRS during 2010 related to the gain we realized on the 2009 sale of our PBM business. Net cash flow used in investing activities was $942.0 during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $1,271.5 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in cash flow used in investing activities of $329.5 between the two periods primarily resulted from changes in securities lending collateral and increases in net proceeds from the sale of investments, partially offset by the purchase of CareMore and an increase in the net purchases of property and equipment. Net cash flow used in financing activities was $2,019.2 during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $3,169.3 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in cash flow used in financing activities of $1,150.1 primarily resulted from decreases in share repurchases, increases in net proceeds from commercial paper borrowings and changes in bank overdrafts, partially offset by changes in securities lending payable, cash dividends paid and an increase in repayments of debt borrowings. Financial Condition We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, of $22,474.0 at December 31, 2012. Since December 31, 2011, total cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, increased by $1,777.5 primarily due to cash generated from operations and increased debt balances, partially offset by cash used in our acquisitions of Amerigroup and 1-800 CONTACTS, common stock repurchases, purchases of property and equipment and cash dividends to shareholders. Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. In addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries. 70 Table of Contents At December 31, 2012, we held at the parent company $2,029.0 of cash and cash equivalents and investments, which is available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, potential future share repurchases and shareholder dividends and debt and interest payments. We calculate a non-GAAP measure, our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, which we believe assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. In addition, our bank covenants indicate a maximum debt-to-capital ratio that we cannot exceed. Our targeted range of debt-to-capital ratio is 25% to 35%. Our debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt plus shareholders’ equity. Our debt-to-capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio was 38.6% and 29.7% as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. The increase in our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio at December 31, 2012 was primarily due to the increased debt we incurred to finance our acquisition of Amerigroup. We expect that over time, our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio will return to be within the targeted range stated above. Our senior debt is rated “A-” by Standard & Poor’s, “BBB+” by Fitch, Inc., “Baa2” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. A significant downgrade in our debt ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs. Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity We have a shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries and the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion. We have a senior credit facility, or the facility, with certain lenders for general corporate purposes. The facility, as amended, provides credit up to $2,000.0 and matures on September 29, 2016. The interest rate on the facility is based on either (i) the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined percentage rate based on our credit rating at the date of utilization, or (ii) a base rate as defined in the facility agreement plus a predetermined percentage rate based on our credit rating at the date of utilization. Our ability to borrow under the facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. There were no amounts outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2012. We have an authorized commercial paper program of up to $2,500.0, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, $570.9 and $799.8, respectively, were outstanding under our commercial paper program. Commercial paper borrowings have been classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2012 and 2011 as our practice and intent is to replace short-term commercial paper outstanding at expiration with additional short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one year and we have the ability to redeem our commercial paper with borrowings under the senior credit facility described above. We are a member, through certain subsidiaries, of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, collectively, the FHLBs, and as a member we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, $250.0 and $100.0, respectively, were outstanding under our short-term FHLBs borrowings. As a result of our acquisition of Amerigroup on December 24, 2012, the carrying amount of $556.9 of Amerigroup’s $475.0 of 7.500% senior unsecured notes due 2019 has been included in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012. On January 25, 2013 we redeemed the outstanding principal balance of these 71 Table of Contents notes, plus applicable premium for early redemption, for cash totaling $555.6. The weighted-average redemption price of the notes was approximately 117% of the principal amount outstanding. On October 9, 2012, we issued $1,500.0 of senior convertible debentures, or the Debentures. The Debentures are governed by an indenture, or the Indenture, dated as of October 9, 2012 between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The Debentures bear interest at a rate of 2.750% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on April 15 and October 15 of each year, and mature on October 15, 2042, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. We used approximately $371.0 of the net proceeds from the issuance to repurchase shares of our common stock concurrently with the offering of the Debentures, and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including but not limited to additional purchases of shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program and the repayment of short-term and/or long-term debt. For additional information related to the Debentures, including the circumstances under which holders may convert the Debentures, see Note 13, “Debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, included in this Form 10-K. On September 10, 2012, we issued $625.0 of 1.250% notes due 2015, $625.0 of 1.875% notes due 2018, $1,000.0 of 3.300% notes due 2023 and $1,000.0 of 4.650% notes due 2043 under our shelf registration statement. We used the net proceeds of this offering to pay a portion of the consideration for our acquisition of Amerigroup and the balance for general corporate purposes. The notes have a call feature that allows us to repurchase the notes at any time at our option and a put feature that allows a note holder to require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the notes below an investment grade rating. At maturity on August 1, 2012, we repaid the $800.0 outstanding balance of our 6.800% senior unsecured notes. On May 7, 2012, we issued $850.0 of 3.125% notes due 2022 and $900.0 of 4.625% notes due 2042 under our shelf registration statement. We used the proceeds from this offering for working capital and for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, repayment of short-term and long-term debt. The notes have a call feature that allows us to repurchase the notes at any time at our option and a put feature that allows a note holder to require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the notes below an investment grade rating. At maturity on April 9, 2012, we refinanced the $100.0 outstanding balance of our long-term 1.430% fixed rate FHLB secured loan to a three month term loan with a fixed interest rate of 0.370% which matured on July 9, 2012. At maturity on January 17, 2012, we repaid the $350.0 outstanding balance of our 6.375% senior unsecured notes. As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we are currently estimating approximately $2,284.0 of dividends to be paid to the parent company during 2013. During 2012, we received $2,935.1 of dividends from our subsidiaries. We regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. 72 Table of Contents A summary of the cash dividend activity for the year ended December 31, 2012 is as follows: DeclarationDate RecordDate PaymentDate CashDividendper Share Total January 24, 2012 March 9, 2012 March 23, 2012 $ 0.2875 $ 95.8 May 16, 2012 June 8, 2012 June 25, 2012 0.2875 93.5 July 24, 2012 September 10, 2012 September 25, 2012 0.2875 90.7 November 6, 2012 December 7, 2012 December 21, 2012 0.2875 87.1 On February 20, 2013, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly shareholder cash dividend to $0.375 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock. This increased quarterly dividend is payable on March 25, 2013 to shareholders of record as of March 8, 2013. A summary of share repurchases for the period January 1, 2013 through February 8, 2013 (subsequent to December 31, 2012) and for the year ended December 31, 2012 is as follows: January 1, 2013ThroughFebruary 8, 2013 Year EndedDecember 31,2012 Shares repurchased 1.1 39.7 Average price per share $ 59.01 $ 62.96 Aggregate cost $ 64.4 $ 2,496.8 Authorization remaining at the end of each period $ 1,772.5 $ 1,836.9 We expect to utilize unused authorization remaining at December 31, 2012 over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares when we believe it is a prudent use of capital. Our current retirement benefits funding strategy is to fund an amount at least equal to the minimum required funding as determined under ERISA with consideration of maximum tax deductible amounts. We may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2012, no material contributions were necessary to meet ERISA required funding levels. However, during the year ended December 31, 2012, we made tax deductible discretionary contributions to the pension benefit plans and other benefit plans of $34.5 and $0.0, respectively. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2012 are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 Years Debt, including capital leases1 $ 23,815.1 $ 1,969.6 $ 2,668.9 $ 3,177.2 $ 15,999.4 Operating lease commitments 801.8 128.7 231.9 171.0 270.2 Projected other postretirement benefits 486.8 38.6 125.1 129.6 193.5 Purchase obligations: IBM outsourcing agreements2 445.0 193.9 251.1 — — Other purchase obligations3 1,793.3 941.8 606.3 214.4 30.8 Other long-term liabilities4 989.9 — 403.8 379.6 206.5 Venture capital commitments 288.1 102.7 100.0 60.9 24.5 Total contractual obligations and commitments $ 28,620.0 $ 3,375.3 $ 4,387.1 $ 4,132.7 $ 16,724.9 1 Includes estimated interest expense. 73 Table of Contents 2 Relates to agreements with International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, to provide information technology infrastructure services. See Note 14, “Commitments and Contingences,” to the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 included in this Form 10-K for further information. 3 Includes obligations related to non-IBM information technology service agreements and telecommunication contracts. 4 Estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from this table as we had no funding requirements under ERISA at December 31, 2012 as a result of the value of the assets in the plans. In addition, amount includes other obligations resulting from third-party service contracts. The above table does not contain $159.2 of gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions and interest for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities. See Note 8, “Income Taxes,” to the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 included in this Form 10-K for further information. In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our senior credit facility or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that will require funding in future periods. Risk-Based Capital Our regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies largely based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under this Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance regulator at the end of each calendar year. Our risk-based capital as of December 31, 2012, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, was in excess of all mandatory RBC thresholds. In addition to exceeding the RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries.

(In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein) As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2012. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return. 75 Table of Contents Investments Our investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk. The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit downgrade to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that downgrade. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately “A.” Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which represent an exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value. Our portfolio includes corporate securities (approximately 43% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2012), which are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. This risk is managed through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately “BBB.” Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systemic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 93.3% of our available-for-sale investments were fixed maturity securities. Market risk is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $740.4 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $744.3 increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly. Our available-for-sale equity securities portfolio, as of December 31, 2012, was approximately 6.7% of our investments. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $124.3. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $124.3. For additional information regarding our investments, see Note 5, “Investments”, to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, and “Investments” within “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Form 10-K. 76 Table of Contents Long-Term Debt Our total long-term debt at December 31, 2012 was $14,727.9, and included $570.9 of commercial paper. The carrying values of the commercial paper approximate fair value as the underlying instruments have variable interest rates at market value. The remainder of the debt includes senior unsecured notes, convertible debentures and subordinated surplus notes by one of our insurance subsidiaries. This debt is subject to interest rate risk as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. These senior unsecured notes had combined carrying and estimated fair value of $13,173.6 and $14,377.1, respectively, at December 31, 2012. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the convertible debentures were $958.1 and $1,613.4, respectively, at December 31, 2012. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the surplus notes were $25.0 and $29.7, respectively, at December 31, 2012. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. For additional information regarding our long-term debt, see Note 13, “Debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, included in this Form 10-K. Derivatives We have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts, which are used to lock-in interest rates or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. We have used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities. Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these derivatives. As of December 31, 2012, we recorded a net asset of $58.5, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swap’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $70.7 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $70.7 increase in fair value. We also utilize put and call options on the S&P 500 index to hedge (on an economic basis) the exposure of our equity security portfolio to fluctuations in the equity markets. While the impact of fluctuations in the equity markets on these derivatives are largely offset by changes in the fair values of our equity security portfolio, the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized immediately in our income statement, whereas the change in fair value of our equity securities is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Accordingly, a decrease in the S&P 500 index of 10% would result in an approximate increase of $64.2 in the fair value of these derivatives. An increase in the S&P 500 index of 10% would result in an approximate decrease of $63.7 in the fair value of these derivatives. For additional information regarding our derivatives, see Note 6, “Derivatives” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, included in this Form 10-K. Also for accounting related to securities in our equity portfolio, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments” within Part II, Item 7. “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Form 10-K. 77 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:53:23.191836
