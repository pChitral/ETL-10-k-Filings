1067983,BRK-B,BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC,2005,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and minority interests. Dollars are in millions. 2004 2003 2002 Insurance – underwriting $ 1,008 $ 1,114 $ (284 ) Insurance – investment income 2,045 2,276 2,096 Non-insurance businesses 1,913 1,745 1,668 Equity in earnings of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company 237 429 359 Interest expense, unallocated (59 ) (59 ) (55 ) Other (95 ) (83 ) (64 ) Investment gains 2,259 2,729 566 Net earnings $ 7,308 $ 8,151 $ 4,286 Berkshire’s operating businesses are managed on a decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by Berkshire’s corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Berkshire’s corporate office management participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. Accordingly, Berkshire’s reportable business segments are organized in a manner that reflects how Berkshire’s top management views those business activities. Certain businesses have been grouped based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics even though those businesses are operated by separate local management. There are approximately 40 separate reporting units. The business segment data (Note 21 to Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Insurance — Underwriting A summary follows of underwriting results from Berkshire’s insurance businesses for the past three years. Dollars are in millions. 2004 2003 2002 Underwriting gain (loss) attributable to: GEICO $ 970 $ 452 $ 416 General Re 3 145 (1,393 ) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 417 1,047 547 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 161 74 32 Underwriting gain (loss) — pre-tax 1,551 1,718 (398 ) Income taxes and minority interests 543 604 (114 ) Net underwriting gain (loss) $ 1,008 $ 1,114 $ (284 ) Berkshire engages in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks. Through General Re, Berkshire also reinsures life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, Berkshire subsidiaries assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, Berkshire subsidiaries assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Berkshire’s principal insurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, one of the five largest auto insurers in the U.S., (2) General Re, one of the four largest reinsurers in the world, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Berkshire’s management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations – underwriting and investing. Accordingly, Berkshire evaluates performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income. A significant marketing strategy followed by all these businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of Berkshire’s insurance businesses totaled approximately $48 billion at December 31, 2004. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet unique needs of sophisticated insurance and reinsurance buyers. Additional information regarding Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance operations follows. 20 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) GEICO GEICO provides primarily private passenger automobile coverages to insureds in 49 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company over the telephone, through the mail or via the Internet. This is a significant element in GEICO’s strategy to be a low cost insurer. In addition, GEICO strives to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICO’s underwriting results for the past three years are summarized below. Dollars are in millions. 2004 2003 2002 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 9,212 $ 8,081 $ 6,963 Premiums earned $ 8,915 100.0 $ 7,784 100.0 $ 6,670 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 6,360 71.3 5,955 76.5 5,137 77.0 Underwriting expenses 1,585 17.8 1,377 17.7 1,117 16.8 Total losses and expenses 7,945 89.1 7,332 94.2 6,254 93.8 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 970 $ 452 $ 416 Premiums earned in 2004 and 2003 increased 14.5% and 16.7%, respectively, over the corresponding prior year amounts. The growth in premiums earned in 2004 for voluntary auto was 14.2% and reflects an 11.8% increase in policies-in-force during the past year and average rate increases of less than two percent. During the third quarter of 2004 GEICO began selling auto insurance in New Jersey, which will contribute to future policies-in-force growth. In late 2004 and early 2005, rate decreases have been implemented in several states in response to improved claims experience. During 2004, policies-in-force increased 8.8% in the preferred risk markets and 21.6% in the standard and nonstandard markets. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2004 increased 14.9% compared to 2003. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2004 were 635,000 higher than at December 31, 2003 and reflect strong growth in the standard and nonstandard lines. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2004 totaled $6,360 million, an increase of 6.8% over 2003. The loss ratio declined to 71.3% in 2004 compared to 76.5% in 2003 and 77.0% in 2002 primarily due to decreasing claim frequencies across all markets and most coverage types. In 2004, claims frequencies for physical damage coverages have decreased in the two to four percent range from 2003 while frequencies for bodily injury coverages decreased in the three to five percent range. Bodily injury severity in 2004 increased in the two to four percent range over 2003 while physical damage severity has increased in the three to six percent range. Incurred losses from catastrophe events totaled approximately $71 million in 2004 (primarily from the hurricanes in the third quarter) compared to $57 million in 2003. Underwriting expenses in 2004 totaled $1,585 million, an increase of 15.1% over 2003, which increased 23.3% over 2002. Policy acquisition expenses in 2004 increased 21.5% over 2003 to $889 million reflecting increased advertising and other costs associated with the increase in policies-in-force. Other operating expenses for 2004 were $696 million, an increase of 7.7% over 2003. The increase in other expenses was due to higher salary, profit sharing and other employee benefit expenses. General Re General Re conducts a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. In North America, property and casualty reinsurance is written on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation. Internationally, property and casualty reinsurance is written on a direct basis through 91% owned Cologne Re (based in Germany) and other wholly-owned affiliates as well as through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written for clients worldwide through Cologne Re. General Re’s pre-tax underwriting results are summarized for the past three years in the following table. Amounts are in millions. Pre-tax underwriting Premiums written Premiums earned gain (loss) 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Property/casualty: North American $ 2,747 $ 3,440 $ 3,975 $ 3,012 $ 3,551 $ 3,967 $ 11 $ 67 $ (1,019 ) International. 2,091 2,742 2,647 2,218 2,847 2,647 (93 ) 20 (319 ) Life/health 2,022 1,839 1,899 2,015 1,847 1,886 85 58 (55 ) $ 6,860 $ 8,021 $ 8,521 $ 7,245 $ 8,245 $ 8,500 $ 3 $ 145 $ (1,393 ) Property/casualty North American property/casualty premiums written in 2004 declined 20.1% from 2003 and 2003 premiums written declined 13.5% compared to 2002. International property and casualty premiums written in 2004 decreased 23.7% from 2003, which increased 3.6% over 2002. The declines in 2004 reflect reductions in the amounts of business accepted over the past two years, offset in part by higher rates. Underwriting performance is not evaluated based upon market share and underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. Management expects written premiums to continue to decline during 2005, primarily due to maintaining underwriting discipline in an increasingly price-competitive property/casualty market. 21 Table of Contents Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) General Re (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) The decline in premiums earned in 2004 from North American operations was attributed to cancellations/non-renewals over new contracts (estimated at $697 million), partially offset by renewal rate increases and changes in renewal terms and conditions across all lines of business (estimated at $158 million). The decline in premiums earned in 2003 from 2002 reflected cancellations/non-renewals exceeding new contracts (estimated at $761 million), partially offset by rate increases across all lines (estimated at $345 million). The decline in international premiums earned in 2004 versus 2003 reflected the reductions of premium volume partially offset by a lower value of the U.S. dollar. In local currencies, 2004 premiums earned declined 29.1% compared with 2003, which, in turn, declined 5.5% in 2003 versus 2002. The North American property/casualty business produced a pre-tax underwriting gain of $11 million in 2004 compared with a gain of $67 million in 2003, and a loss of $1,019 million in 2002. The $11 million net underwriting gain in 2004 was comprised of current accident year gains of $166 million, partially offset by $155 million in prior accident year losses. Current accident year results included approximately $120 million of catastrophe losses from the four hurricanes that struck the Southeast United States in the third quarter. Despite these losses, current accident year underwriting results benefited from the favorable effects of re-pricing efforts and improved coverage terms and conditions implemented over the past three years and a one time reduction of $70 million in pension expense during the third quarter, resulting from the curtailment of certain benefits at the end of 2005. Underwriting results for 2003 included net underwriting gains for the current accident year of $200 million compared to $66 million in 2002. The current accident year results in 2003 and 2002 reflected re-pricing efforts and unusually low amounts of large individual and catastrophe-related property losses. In both 2003 and 2002, the current accident year gains were reduced or eliminated by additional losses ($133 million in 2003 and $1,085 million in 2002) established for prior accident years’ loss occurrences. In 2004, the $155 million charge related to prior accident year loss occurrences consisted of $729 million of increases in casualty and workers’ compensation reserves, $110 million related to discount accretion on workers’ compensation reserves and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance coverages, offset by $307 million of reserve reductions for prior year property losses and $377 million of gains associated with contract commutations and settlements. The aforementioned increases in workers’ compensation reserves in 2004 reflected escalating medical utilization and inflation, and casualty reserve increases related primarily to losses under financial institutions errors and omissions and directors and officers’ lines of business and asbestos and environmental mass tort exposures. The decrease in property reserves in 2004 was primarily due to reductions in estimated World Trade Center losses. As previously stated, underwriting results in 2003 and 2002 included $133 million and $1,085 million, respectively, in losses related to prior accident years, which included $99 million and $95 million, respectively, from discount accretion on workers’ compensation reserves and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance contracts. In 2002, reserve increases also included $990 million in increased loss estimates mostly related to casualty lines of business (general liability, workers’ compensation, medical malpractice, auto liability and professional liability coverages), principally for the 1997 through 2000 accident years, partially offset by $115 million of reserve reductions related to reduced estimates for certain World Trade Center claims. Although loss reserve levels are now believed to be adequate, there are no guarantees. A relatively small change in the estimate of net reserves can produce large changes in annual underwriting results. In addition, the timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual property losses are expected to continue to contribute to volatile periodic underwriting results in the future. See “Critical Accounting Policies” for additional information concerning loss reserves. International property/casualty businesses produced a pre-tax underwriting loss of $93 million in 2004 compared with a gain of $20 million in 2003, and a loss of $319 million in 2002. Underwriting results in 2004 include $110 million of catastrophe losses from the third quarter hurricanes. In 2003, losses from catastrophes and large individual property losses were minimal and in 2002 totaled $124 million, primarily from flood and storm losses in Europe. Underwriting results for each of the last three years benefited from favorable results of the aviation business and relatively low non-catastrophe property losses. Underwriting results of the international businesses have improved overall over the last two years as a result of re-pricing efforts and more disciplined underwriting. Underwriting results of the international property and casualty businesses included losses from prior years’ loss occurrences of $102 million in 2004, $104 million in 2003 and $320 million in 2002. Life and health Life and health premiums earned in 2004 increased $168 million (9.1%) over 2003, which decreased by $39 million (2.1%) compared with 2002. Adjusting for the effects of foreign currency exchange, premiums earned increased 3.7% in 2004 and declined 9.6% in 2003. The increase in premiums earned is due in part to the strengthening of foreign currencies and an increase in European life business. The decline in 2003 was primarily due to decreases in the group and individual health businesses in the U.S. life/health operations. Underwriting results for the global life/health operations produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $85 million in 2004 and $58 million in 2003, compared with an underwriting loss of $55 million in 2002. While both the U.S. and international life/health operations were profitable in both 2004 and 2003, most of the gains were earned in the international life business. The underwriting losses for 2002 were principally due to increased reserves on run-off business in the U.S. life/health operations. 22 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) underwrites excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages for insurers and reinsurers around the world. BHRG’s business includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance, excess direct and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual discrete property risks referred to as individual risk. Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Other multi-line reinsurance refers to other contracts that are written on both a quota-share and excess basis, and include participations in and contracts with Lloyd’s syndicates. Amounts in the table below are in millions. Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Catastrophe and individual risk $ 1,462 $ 1,330 $ 1,283 $ 385 $ 1,108 $ 1,006 Retroactive reinsurance 188 526 407 (412 ) (387 ) (433 ) Other multi-line 2,064 2,574 1,610 444 326 (26 ) Total $ 3,714 $ 4,430 $ 3,300 $ 417 $ 1,047 $ 547 Catastrophe and individual risk contracts may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification, often several hundred million dollars and occasionally in excess of $1 billion, and cover catastrophe risks (such as hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters) or other property risks (such as aviation and aerospace, commercial multi-peril or terrorism). Catastrophe and individual business written totaled about $1.5 billion in 2004 and $1.2 billion in 2003. The level of business written in future periods will vary, perhaps materially, based upon market conditions and management’s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. Premiums written in 2004 included $165 million to reinstate coverages as a result of the third quarter hurricane losses. In 2004, underwriting results from catastrophe and individual risk business included estimated catastrophe losses of $790 million, primarily from four hurricanes that struck the U.S. and Caribbean during the third quarter. The catastrophe and individual risk business produced substantial underwriting gains in 2003 and 2002 due to the lack of catastrophic or otherwise large loss events. However, catastrophic losses (such as the recent hurricane losses) are anticipated to occur over time, which could exceed the gains earned in recent years. The pre-tax maximum probable loss from a single event at December 31, 2004 is estimated to be $5 billion resulting from potential risk of loss from a major earthquake in California. BHRG, as a matter of general practice, does not cede catastrophe and individual risks to other reinsurers. The timing and magnitude of such losses may produce extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results. Nevertheless, Berkshire’s management remains willing to accept such volatility provided there is a reasonable prospect of long-term underwriting profitability. Retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify ceding companies for losses arising under insurance or reinsurance contracts written in the past, often many years ago. While contract terms vary, losses under the contracts are subject to a very large aggregate dollar limit, occasionally exceeding $1 billion under a single contract. Generally, it is also anticipated, although not assured, that claims under retroactive contracts will be paid over long time periods. These contracts do not produce an immediate underwriting loss for financial reporting purposes. The excess of the estimated ultimate claims payable over the premiums received is established as a deferred charge which is subsequently amortized over the expected claim settlement periods. Such amortization is included as a component of losses incurred. Underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance are primarily attributed to the amortization of deferred charges established on retroactive reinsurance contracts. Deferred charges, which represent the difference between the policy premium and the estimated ultimate claim reserves, are amortized over the expected claim payment period using the interest method. The timing and amount of expected future losses are re-estimated periodically. Deferred charge balances are adjusted accordingly on a retrospective basis via a cumulative adjustment. Gross loss reserves established under retroactive reinsurance totaled approximately $10 billion as of December 31, 2004 and losses paid during the year totaled approximately $860 million. Unamortized deferred charges at December 31, 2004 totaled approximately $2.45 billion compared to approximately $2.85 billion as of December 31, 2003. Management believes that these charges are reasonable relative to the large amount of float generated from these policies. Income generated from the investment of float is reflected in investment income and investment gains. Premiums earned in 2004 from traditional multi-line reinsurance decreased $510 million (19.8%) compared to 2003. The comparative decrease was primarily due to declines in quota-share participations (including Lloyd’s) and the termination of a major quota-share contract in mid-2003. Several contracts were not renewed or were curtailed in 2004 so further premium declines are anticipated in 2005. Pre-tax underwriting results in 2004 included losses of approximately $175 million arising from the third quarter hurricanes affecting the United States and Caribbean. However, these losses were more than offset by increased underwriting gains in aviation coverages and approximately $160 million in gains from the commutations of several reinsurance contracts in 2004. Underwriting gains in 2003 reflected low amounts of property and aviation losses. There were no significant commutations in 2003. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group Berkshire’s primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of smaller insurance businesses that principally write liability coverages for commercial accounts. These businesses include: National Indemnity Company’s primary group operation (“NICO Primary Group”), a writer of motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation (“USIC”), 23 Table of Contents Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued) whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as “Homestate” operations, providers of standard multi-line insurance; and Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions. Collectively, Berkshire’s other primary insurance businesses produced earned premiums of $1,211 million in 2004, $1,034 million in 2003, and $712 million in 2002. The increases in premiums earned during the past two years were largely attributed to increased volume of USIC and the NICO Primary Group. Net underwriting gains of Berkshire’s other primary insurance businesses totaled $161 million in 2004, $74 million in 2003 and $32 million in 2002. The improvement in year-to-year comparative underwriting results was due to the aforementioned increases in premiums and better-than-expected claim experience. Insurance — Investment Income Following is a summary of the net investment income of Berkshire’s insurance operations for the past three years. Dollars are in millions. 2004 2003 2002 Investment income before taxes $ 2,824 $ 3,223 $ 3,050 Applicable income taxes and minority interests 779 947 954 Investment income after taxes and minority interests $ 2,045 $ 2,276 $ 2,096 Pre-tax investment income earned by Berkshire’s insurance businesses in 2004 totaled $2,824 million, a decrease of 12.4% from 2003. The decline reflects increased amounts invested in low-yielding cash and cash equivalents in 2004 as well as a reduction in amounts invested in high-yield corporate obligations. In the second half of 2004, short-term interest rates in the United States increased, which should result in increased earnings from such investments in 2005 periods when compared to 2004 periods. Management continues to seek to invest cash balances into long-term instruments, including business acquisitions. However, absent such opportunities, investment income may remain relatively low. Berkshire’s management believes that this current strategy, while potentially hurting current earnings, is appropriate in preserving capital and maintaining flexibility to make significant acquisitions when opportunities arise. A summary of investments held in Berkshire’s insurance businesses follows. Dollar amounts are in millions. Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, 2004 2003 2002 Cash and cash equivalents $ 38,706 $ 29,908 $ 9,468 Marketable equity securities 37,420 35,017 28,155 Fixed maturity securities 22,831 26,087 38,395 Other 2,059 2,656 3,133 $ 101,016 $ 93,668 $ 79,151 Fixed maturity investments as of December 31, 2004 were as follows. Dollar amounts are in millions. Amortized Unrealized cost gains Fair value U.S. Treasury, government corporations and agencies $ 1,576 $ 14 $ 1,590 States, municipalities and political subdivisions 3,569 156 3,725 Foreign governments 6,996 91 7,087 Corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, investment grade 3,866 340 4,206 Corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, non-investment grade 2,675 1,552 4,227 Mortgage-backed securities 1,903 93 1,996 $ 20,585 $ 2,246 $ 22,831 All U.S. government obligations are rated AAA by the major rating agencies and about 95% of all state, municipal and political subdivisions, foreign government obligations and mortgage-backed securities were rated AA or higher by the major rating agencies. Non-investment grade securities represent securities that are rated below BBB- or Baa3. Fair value reflects quoted market prices where available or, if not available, prices obtained from independent pricing services. Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities assumed under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float totaled $46.1 billion at December 31, 2004, $44.2 billion at December 31, 2003 and $41.2 billion at December 31, 2002. The cost of float, as represented by the ratio of pre-tax underwriting gain or loss to average float, was negative for 2004 and 2003, as Berkshire’s insurance businesses generated pre-tax underwriting gains. 24 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Non-Insurance Businesses A summary follows of results from Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses for the past three years. Dollars are in millions. 2004 2003 2002 Pre-tax earnings $ 3,065 $ 2,776 $ 2,667 Income taxes and minority interests 1,152 1,031 999 Net earnings $ 1,913 $ 1,745 $ 1,668 A comparison of revenues and pre-tax earnings between 2004, 2003 and 2002 for the non-insurance businesses follows. Dollars are in millions. Revenues Pre-tax earnings (loss) 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Apparel $ 2,200 $ 2,075 $ 1,619 $ 325 $ 289 $ 229 Building products 4,337 3,846 3,702 643 559 516 Finance and financial products 3,774 3,045 2,234 584 619 726 Flight services * 3,244 2,431 2,837 191 72 225 McLane Company 23,373 13,743 — 228 150 — Retail 2,601 2,311 2,103 163 165 166 Shaw Industries 5,174 4,660 4,334 466 436 424 Other businesses 3,213 3,040 2,375 465 486 381 $ 47,916 $ 35,151 $ 19,204 $ 3,065 $ 2,776 $ 2,667 * In 2004, Berkshire adopted the provisions of EITF 00-21(“Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables”). As a result, for consolidated reporting purposes, the method of recognizing revenue related to NetJets’ fractional aircraft sales was changed. Management continues to evaluate the results of NetJets under the prior revenue recognition criteria and thus has shown revenues and pre-tax earnings for the flight services segment using the prior revenue recognition method. The prior revenue recognition method results in the revenues and pre-tax earnings in this table being $902 million greater and $74 million greater than the amounts reported in Berkshire’s consolidated financial statements. Apparel Apparel revenues in 2004 totaled $2,200 million, an increase of $125 million (6%) over 2003. Increased sales by Fruit of the Loom (“FOL”) accounted for essentially all of the increase, as unit sales increased 14%, offset partially by lower net selling prices. FOL generated approximately 60% of total apparel group revenues in 2004. Pre-tax earnings of apparel businesses totaled $325 million in 2004, an increase of 12% over 2003. About half of the increase in pre-tax earnings was generated by FOL due to the aforementioned unit sales increase, although lower net selling prices and higher cotton costs resulted in a decrease in FOL’s gross margin rate. In addition, increased earnings were achieved in the footwear businesses (HH Brown and Justin) and children’s apparel (Garan), which benefited from increased sales as well as expense controls. The increases in sales and pre-tax earnings in 2003 over 2002 were due largely to acquisitions of FOL (April 2002) and Garan (September 2002). Building products Building products revenues in 2004 totaled $4,337 million, an increase of $491 million (13%) over 2003. Increased sales volume was generated in all significant product lines in 2004, including insulation and roofing products (11%), paint (8%), brick and masonry (4%) and steel connector plates and truss components (38%), which also reflected higher selling prices. Favorable housing construction markets in the U.S. continued in 2004, which benefited the group as a whole. Pre-tax earnings of the building products group in 2004 exceeded earnings in 2003 by $84 million (15%), reflecting increased pre-tax earnings from insulation products and connector plate/truss components. In addition, the results for 2003 of the insulation business included a loss of $21 million from a fire at a pipe insulation plant. (Eliminating the impact of the fire loss reduces the earnings increase to about 11%). Over the past year, certain production costs (such as steel, petroleum-based materials, and energy, such as natural gas) have risen significantly. For instance, the cost of steel (used in manufacturing connector plates and trusses) has risen about 100% over the past year. Also, average prices for natural gas (used in manufacturing fiberglass and bricks) and gasoline (delivery costs) have risen significantly over the past year. Such rapid increases produced declines in profit margins, which accelerated during the last half of 2004. Revenues and pre-tax earnings of the building products group in 2003 and 2002 benefited from the favorable residential housing construction markets. 25 Table of Contents Non-Insurance Businesses (Continued) Finance and financial products Revenues generated by the finance and financial products group in 2004 totaled $3,774 million, an increase of 24% over 2003. Revenues in 2004 include Clayton Homes for the full year. Clayton was acquired by Berkshire on August 7, 2003 and its results are included in Berkshire’s consolidated financial statements beginning as of that date. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding this acquisition. Clayton generated total revenues of approximately $2,024 million in 2004 compared to $512 million in 2003. Excluding Clayton, finance revenues in 2004 declined $783 million from 2003. Life insurance annuity premiums of $700 million were earned in the last half of 2003 from a few sizable transactions. Annuity premiums generated in 2004 were nominal. The comparative declines in 2004 revenues also reflect lower interest income, resulting from lower amounts of invested assets associated with leveraged investing activities, including reduced interest from Berkadia’s loan to FINOVA, and higher proportions of low-yielding short-term investments to total invested assets. Somewhat offsetting the decline was the fact that Value Capital was consolidated during the first half of 2004. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Value Capital. Pre-tax earnings from finance and financial products businesses, excluding investment gains/losses, in 2004 were $584 million, a decrease of $35 million (6%) from 2003. Pre-tax earnings reflect the inclusion of Clayton for the full year of 2004 as well as much improved earnings from leasing businesses (CORT and XTRA). In 2004, the leasing businesses generated pre-tax earnings of $92 million compared to $34 million in 2003. In addition, the net loss from the run-off of General Re’s finance business was reduced by $55 million in 2004. Pre-tax earnings from leveraged investing activities declined approximately $163 million in 2004 as a result of comparatively lower amounts of invested assets. In addition, pre-tax earnings for 2004 of the life/annuity insurance business declined approximately $142 million as a result of higher allocations of investments in cash and cash equivalents, a significant reduction in the early redemption of fixed-income securities purchased at a discount and adverse changes in mortality assumptions. Flight services Flight service revenues increased $813 million (33%) over 2003. Over 90% of the revenue increase resulted from the NetJets business where flight operations revenue increased just under $400 million and revenues from aircraft sales increased about $360 million. The increase in flight operations revenue was primarily due to higher usage, a larger percentage of hours being on larger aircraft and a slight rate increase. Sales of fractional aircraft increased due to an approximately 10% increase in aircraft sold and a higher percentage of sales being large cabin aircraft which carry a higher sales price. In 2004, revenues from FlightSafety increased about $57 million (10% over the prior year). Increased revenues from simulator sales represent about 65% of the increase with increased training revenues accounting for the remainder. Increased training revenues in 2004 were attributed to a 13% increase in simulator usage, primarily from corporate aviation and regional airline customers, offset by reduced revenues from government customers. Pre-tax earnings of flight services businesses totaled $191 million in 2004, an increase of $119 million as compared to 2003. About half of this increase is due to reduced write downs of certain simulators and aircraft inventory. During 2003, such write downs were about $69 million and during 2004 they were about $12 million. Pre-tax earnings from FlightSafety’s training business, excluding asset write downs, increased about $33 million due to the aforementioned revenue increases. Pre-tax earnings from NetJets’ flight operations business, excluding asset write downs, improved by about $25 million. Operating results of the flight services business have improved gradually since 2003. These businesses were adversely affected by the attack on the World Trade Center and the deterioration in the U.S. economy that followed. Revenues and pre-tax earnings of this segment in 2003 declined in comparison with 2002. McLane Company On May 23, 2003, Berkshire acquired McLane Company, Inc., a distributor of grocery and food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the McLane acquisition. Results of McLane’s business operations are included in Berkshire’s consolidated results beginning on that date. McLane’s revenues in 2004 totaled $23.4 billion and for the full year 2003 totaled about $22 billion. Pre-tax earnings totaled $228 million in 2004 and $225 million for the full year 2003. The comparative year-to-date increases in sales reflect the addition of new customers since Berkshire’s acquisition and growth in the food service business. In 2004, approximately 33% of McLane’s annual revenues derived from sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. McLane’s business is marked by high sales volume and very thin profit margins. Retail Berkshire’s principal retail operations consist of home furnishings and jewelry retailers. Total revenues attributed to retail operations were $2.60 billion in 2004 and $2.31 billion in 2003. Same store sales in 2004 increased 2.4% from 2003. Pre-tax earnings of the retail group totaled $163 million in 2004 compared to $165 million in 2003. The increase in sales was substantially offset by higher costs associated with new home furnishings stores, including increased salaries and benefits, depreciation, and distribution costs. 26 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Non-Insurance Businesses (Continued) Shaw Industries Floor covering sales generated by Shaw Industries totaled $5.17 billion in 2004, an increase of $514 million (11%) over 2003. The increase in revenues was driven by an approximate 9% increase in square yards of carpet sold, higher net selling prices and increased hard surface and rug sales. Sales in 2004 include those of two businesses acquired by Shaw (Georgia Tufters and the North Georgia operations of the Dixie Group) in 2003, which contributed sales of $240 million in 2004 and $50 million in 2003. Pre-tax earnings in 2004 totaled $466 million, an increase of $30 million (7%) over 2003. During 2004, petroleum-based raw material costs increased on several occasions. Production cost inflation was driven by higher petroleum-based raw material and energy related costs. Sales price increases have lagged raw material supplier price increases resulting in a decline in gross sales margins during 2004. Further margin declines in 2005 are possible. Equity in Earnings of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company Earnings from MidAmerican represent Berkshire’s share of MidAmerican’s net earnings, as determined under the equity method. In 2004, Berkshire’s share of MidAmerican’s net earnings was $237 million versus $429 million in 2003. During the third quarter of 2004, MidAmerican recorded an after-tax charge of $340 million (of which Berkshire’s share was about $255 million) to write down certain assets of an operation that was shut down in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2004, MidAmerican realized a gain of $44 million (Berkshire’s share was about $33 million) from the realization of certain Enron-related bankruptcy claims. Ignoring the effect to these two non-recurring events Berkshire’s share of MidAmerican’s 2004 net earnings was $459 million, which reflects improved results at most of MidAmerican’s major operating units. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding MidAmerican. Investment Gains/Losses Investment gains and losses arise when investments are sold and foreign currency forward contracts are marked-to-market with a corresponding gain or loss included in earnings. Investment gains and losses also arise in connection with investments by Berkshire in life settlement contracts. Investment losses can also arise when available-for-sale or held-to-maturity securities are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired (“OTTI”). A summary of investment gains and losses follows. Dollar amounts are in millions. 2004 2003 2002 Investment gains (losses) from - Sales of investments - Insurance and other $ 1,527 $ 2,873 $ 961 Finance and financial products 61 338 284 OTTI securities (19 ) (289 ) (607 ) Foreign currency forward contracts 1,839 825 297 Life settlement contracts (207 ) — — Other 288 374 (51 ) Investment gains before income taxes and minority interests 3,489 4,121 884 Income taxes and minority interests 1,230 1,392 318 Net investment gains $ 2,259 $ 2,729 $ 566 Prior to January 1, 2004, Berkshire accounted for investments in life settlement contracts on the cost basis. Therefore, the cost of the investment included the initial purchase price plus periodic maintenance costs. Beginning in 2004, as a result of obtaining information which suggested that the SEC believed that a different accounting method should be used, these investments are being accounted for under FASB Technical Bulletin (“FTB”) 85-4 “Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance.” Under FTB 85-4, the carrying value of each contract at purchase and at the end of each reporting period is equal to the cash surrender value of the contract. Cash paid to purchase these contracts that is in excess of the cash surrender value at the date of purchase is recognized as a loss immediately and periodic maintenance costs, such as premiums necessary to keep the underlying policy in force, are charged to earnings immediately. The life insurance benefits are payable to the Company. The loss during 2004 included $73 million related to life settlement contracts held at December 31, 2003. Despite the accounting loss recorded for these contracts, management views these contracts to have a current value no less than the cost paid for the policies plus any subsequent maintenance costs and believes these contracts will produce satisfactory earnings. Gains and losses from foreign currency contracts arise as the value of the U.S. dollar changes against certain foreign currencies. Small changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates can produce material changes in the fair value of these contracts given the large net notional value of Berkshire’s open contracts ($21.4 billion as of December 31, 2004) and consequently, may produce exceptional volatility in reported earnings in a given period. 27 Table of Contents Financial Condition Berkshire’s balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2004 totaled $85.9 billion. Consolidated cash and invested assets, excluding assets of finance and financial products businesses, totaled approximately $102.9 billion at December 31, 2004 (including cash and cash equivalents of $40.0 billion) and $95.6 billion at December 31, 2003 (including $31.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents). Berkshire’s consolidated notes payable and other borrowings, excluding borrowings of finance businesses, totaled $3.5 billion at December 31, 2004 and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2003. During 2004, commercial paper and short-term borrowings of subsidiaries declined $388 million, primarily from repayments arising from operating cash flow of NetJets and Shaw. Additionally, investment contract balances of $226 million were repaid during 2004. In May 2002, Berkshire issued the SQUARZ securities, which consist of $400 million par amount of senior notes due in November 2007 together with warrants to purchase 4,464 Class A equivalent shares of Berkshire common stock, which expire in May 2007. A warrant premium is payable to Berkshire at an annual rate of 3.75% and interest is payable to note holders at a rate of 3.00%. Each warrant provides the holder the right to purchase either 0.1116 shares of Class A or 3.348 shares of Class B stock for $10,000. In addition, holders of the senior notes have the option to require Berkshire to repurchase the senior notes at par on May 15, 2005 and 2006, provided that the holders also surrender a corresponding amount of warrants for cancellation. All warrants and senior notes were outstanding as of December 31, 2004. Assets of the finance and financial products businesses totaled $30.1 billion as of December 31, 2004, compared to $49.0 billion at June 30, 2004 and $28.3 billion at December 31, 2003. Liabilities totaled $20.4 billion as of December 31, 2004 compared to $42.2 billion at June 30, 2004 and $22.0 billion at December 31, 2003. As discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Berkshire consolidated the accounts of Value Capital, L.P. beginning as of January 1, 2004, and as a result of a reduction of its ownership interest in the partnership, discontinued consolidation effective July 1, 2004. As of June 30, 2004, Value Capital’s assets and liabilities totaled $24.1 billion and $23.4 billion, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents of finance and financial products businesses totaled $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2004 and $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2003. During 2004, manufactured housing loans of Clayton increased approximately $5.0 billion to $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily attributed to a loan portfolio acquisition of approximately $3.7 billion on December 30, 2004. Clayton is a leading builder of manufactured housing, provides financing to customers, and acquires other installment loan portfolios. Prior to its acquisition by Berkshire in August 2003, Clayton securitized and sold a significant portion of its installment loans through special purpose entities. In early 2003, Clayton discontinued loan securitizations and sales. Notes payable and other borrowings of Berkshire’s finance and financial products businesses totaled $5.4 billion at December 31, 2004 and $4.9 billion at December 31, 2003. During 2004, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”) issued a total of $1.6 billion par amount of medium term notes due from 2007 through 2014. The proceeds of these issues were used to finance originated and acquired loans of Clayton. These medium term notes are guaranteed by Berkshire. On January 4, 2005, BHFC issued an additional $3.75 billion par amount of medium term notes to finance Clayton’s December 30, 2004 loan portfolio acquisition discussed above. In February 2004, the remaining balance of Berkadia’s bank borrowing ($525 million) was repaid upon the collection of the final $525 million loan to FINOVA and in the second quarter GRS repaid debt of approximately $550 million. Berkshire believes that it currently maintains sufficient liquidity to cover its existing contractual obligations and provide for contingent liquidity. Contractual Obligations A summary of long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 follows. Amounts represent estimates of gross undiscounted amounts payable over time. In addition, certain losses and loss adjustment expenses for property and casualty loss reserves are ceded to others under reinsurance contracts and therefore are recoverable. Such potential recoverables are not reflected in the table. Amounts are in millions. Estimated payments due by period Total 2005 2006-2007 2008-2009 After 2009 Notes payable and other borrowings (1) $ 11,753 $ 1,937 $ 2,138 $ 2,321 $ 5,357 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (1) 5,831 5,831 — — — Operating leases 1,628 364 528 328 408 Purchase obligations (2) 7,759 3,103 2,285 1,504 867 Unpaid losses and loss expenses 47,878 11,023 12,280 6,637 17,938 Other long-term policyholder liabilities 4,308 94 78 72 4,064 Other (3) 7,124 430 517 416 5,761 Total $ 86,281 $ 22,782 $ 17,826 $ 11,278 $ 34,395 (1) Includes interest (2) Principally relates to NetJets’ aircraft purchases (3) Principally annuity reserves and employee benefits 28 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Contractual Obligations (Continued) Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Notes payable and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements along with accrued but unpaid interest as of the balance sheet date. In addition, Berkshire will be obligated to pay interest under debt obligations for periods subsequent to the balance sheet date. Although certain principal balances may be prepaid in advance of the maturity date, which could reduce future interest obligations, it is assumed that no principal prepayments will occur for purposes of this disclosure. Further, while short-term borrowings and repurchase agreements are currently expected to be renewed as they mature, such amounts are not assumed to renew for purposes of this disclosure. Berkshire and subsidiaries are also parties to long-term contracts to acquire goods or services in the future, which are not currently reflected in the financial statements. Such obligations, including future minimum rentals under operating leases, will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date. Contractual obligations for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are estimates. The timing and amount of such payments is contingent upon the ultimate outcome of claim settlements that will occur over many years. The amounts presented in the preceding table are based upon past claim settlement activities. The timing and amount of such payments are subject to significant estimation error. The factors affecting the ultimate amount of claims are discussed in the following section regarding Berkshire’s critical accounting policies. Accordingly, the actual timing and amount of payments may differ materially from the amounts shown in the table. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized in the financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on numerous assumptions involving varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, the amounts currently reflected in the financial statements will likely increase or decrease in the future as additional information becomes available. Property and casualty losses A summary of Berkshire’s consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Except for certain workers’ compensation reserves, liabilities for unpaid property and casualty reserves are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value, regardless of the length of the claim-tail. Dollars are in millions. Gross unpaid losses Net unpaid losses* Dec. 31, 2004 Dec. 31, 2003 Dec. 31, 2004 Dec. 31, 2003 General Re $ 22,258 $ 23,820 $ 20,056 $ 20,787 BHRG 16,235 15,769 13,132 12,513 GEICO 5,112 4,492 4,867 4,282 Berkshire Hathaway Primary 1,614 1,312 1,542 1,217 Total $ 45,219 $ 45,393 $ 39,597 $ 38,799 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges reinsurance assumed and before foreign currency translation effects. Berkshire records liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts related to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. Depending on the type of loss being estimated, the timing and amount of property and casualty loss payments are subject to a great degree of variability and are contingent, among other things, upon the timing of the claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the determination and payment of the ultimate loss amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used to establish and review the liabilities for unpaid losses recorded as of the balance sheet date. While techniques may vary, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amount payable in the future with respect to loss events that have occurred. As of any balance sheet date, claims that have occurred have not all been reported, and if reported may not have been settled. The time period between the occurrence date and payment date of a loss is referred to as the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within no more than a few years after 29 Table of Contents Property and casualty losses (Continued) occurrence. Casualty losses usually have very long claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal environment, which contributes to extended claim-tails. Claim-tails for reinsurers may be further extended due to delayed reporting by ceding insurers or reinsurers due to contractual provisions or reporting practices. The loss and loss expense reserves include provisions for those claims that have been reported (referred to as “case reserves”) and for those claims that have not been reported, referred to as incurred but not yet reported (“IBNR”) reserves. Receivables recorded with respect to insurance losses ceded to other reinsurers under reinsurance contracts are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses and, therefore, are also subject to estimation error. In addition to the factors cited above, reinsurance recoverables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders. Each of Berkshire’s significant insurance operations (including GEICO, General Re and BHRG) utilize techniques for establishing reserves that are believed to best fit the business. Additional information regarding reserves established by each of the significant businesses follows. GEICO GEICO’s gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves as of December 31, 2004 totaled $5,112 million and net of reinsurance recoverable were $4,867 million. As of December 31, 2004, gross reserves included $3,690 million of case reserves and $1,422 million of IBNR reserves. GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance which has a relatively short claim-tail. Accordingly, the risk of estimation error is thought to be much less at GEICO than for either General Re or BHRG. The key assumptions affecting GEICO’s reserves include projections of ultimate claim counts and average loss per claim (“severity”), which includes loss adjustment expenses. GEICO’s reserving methodologies produce reserve estimates based upon the individual claims (or a “ground-up” approach), which in the aggregate yields a point estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Ranges of loss estimates are not calculated in the aggregate. A detailed discussion of the process and significant factors considered in establishing reserves follows. Actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserves using recognized standard statistical loss development methods and techniques. The significant reserve components (and percentage of gross reserves) are: (1) average reserves (20%), (2) case and case development reserves (55%), and (3) incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) reserves (25%). Each component of loss reserves is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. Such amounts are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, jurisdiction of loss, reporting date and occurrence date, among other factors. A brief discussion of each component follows. Average reserve amounts are established for property claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. Average reserve amounts are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened. The average severity per claim amount is projected each accident quarter, reflecting both reported claims and unreported claims. Claim adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as soon as the specific facts and merits of each claim can be evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised as more information becomes known. For most liability coverages, case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim-tail, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the claim is first reported. Therefore, additional case development reserve estimates are established, usually as a percentage of the case reserve. In general, case development factors are selected by historical statistical analysis, which includes incurred case loss analysis for groups of claims from period-to-period projected to future dates and amounts (or age-to-age techniques) when substantially all of the claims are expected to be settled. Case development factors are reviewed and revised periodically based upon trends in loss development patterns. For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts, to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are subtracted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits, long-term claimants from personal injury protection coverages or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established. 30 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) For each of its major coverages, GEICO tests the adequacy of the total loss reserves using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period over intervals of time until substantially all of the expected claims have been settled. GEICO’s exposure to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining reserves associated with such exposure is currently a relatively insignificant component of GEICO’s total reserves (3%) and there is little if any apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure. Related claim activity over the past year was insignificant. General Re General Re’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2004 are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Workers’ Property Compensation Casualty Total Reported case reserves $ 1,996 $ 2,168 $ 8,204 $ 12,368 IBNR reserves 1,361 957 7,572 9,890 Gross reserves $ 3,357 $ 3,125 $ 15,776 22,258 Ceded reserves and deferred charges (2,202 ) Net reserves $ 20,056 General Re’s process of establishing loss reserve estimates is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (“ACR’s”) and IBNR reserves. Critical judgments in the establishment of these loss reserves involve the establishment of ACR’s by claim examiners, the expectation of ultimate loss ratios, which drive IBNR reserve amounts and the case reserve reporting trends compared to the expected loss reporting patterns. Actuaries do not routinely calculate loss reserve ranges, because it is currently believed that the mathematics of determining ranges has not been sufficiently developed and the myriad of assumptions required, render such resulting range to be unreliable. In addition, counts of claims or average amount per claim are not utilized because clients do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail. General Re claim examiners establish case reserve estimates based on the facts and circumstances of the claims and the terms and provisions of the insurance and reinsurance contracts. For reinsurance claims, claim examiners receive notices from client companies in a manner that reflects the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Contract terms governing claim reporting are generally based on the client’s view of the case loss (e.g., claims with reserves greater than one-half the retention) or injury type (e.g., any claim arising from a fatality). Some reinsurance contracts permit claims to be reported on a bulk basis. Bulk reporting provisions generally apply to quota-share reinsurance contracts. Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners’ estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners’ estimates are significantly greater than the ceding company’s estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACR’s are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. Examiners also conduct claim reviews at client companies periodically and case reserves are often increased as a result. In 2004, claim examiners conducted in excess of 400 claim reviews. Actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (reserve cells) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative, and program) and line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, etc.). For each reserve cell, losses are aggregated by accident year and analyzed over time. Depending on client reporting practices, some losses and premiums are aggregated by policy year. These loss aggregations are called loss triangles, which are the primary basis for IBNR reserve calculations. North American operations presently review over 300 reserve cells and the international operations presently review about 900 reserve cells. Loss triangles are used to determine the expected case loss emergence patterns and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, are further used to determine IBNR reserves. Certain calculations are performed and form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern. The determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly a mechanical process. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, estimation formulas are used along with reliance on other loss triangles and judgment. Factors affecting loss development triangles include but are not limited to the following: changing client claims practices, changes in claim examiners use of ACR’s or the frequency of client company claim reviews, changes in the mix of policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. These items influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns. 31 Table of Contents General Re (Continued) Expected loss ratios are selected by reserve cell, by accident year, based upon reviewing indicated ultimate loss ratios predicted from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premium. If the selected emergence pattern is not accurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios will not be correct and this can influence the selected loss ratios and hence the IBNR reserve. As with selected loss emergence patterns, selecting expected loss ratios is not a strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing loss ratios. IBNR reserves are estimated by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence pattern and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are generally updated every year-end. Once the year-end IBNR reserves are determined, actuaries calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year. This calculation does not involve new assumptions and uses the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year. In certain reserve cells (excess directors and officers and errors and omissions) IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses, without consideration of expected emergence patterns. These cells typically involve a spike in loss activity arising from recent industry developments making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern as has been experienced from the recent wave of corporate scandals that have caused an increase in reported losses. Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for asbestos and hazardous waste claims. Unpaid environmental, asbestos and mass tort reserves at December 31, 2004 were approximately $1.6 billion gross and $1.3 billion net of reinsurance. Such reserves were approximately $1.2 billion gross and $1.0 billion net of reinsurance as of December 31, 2003. Claims paid attributable to such losses were about $70 million in 2004. BHRG BHRG’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2004 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions. Property Casualty Total Reported case reserves $ 1,526 $ 1,506 $ 3,032 IBNR reserves 991 2,167 3,158 Retroactive — 10,045 10,045 Gross reserves $ 2,517 $ 13,718 16,235 Ceded reserves and deferred charges (3,103 ) Net reserves $ 13,132 As of December 31, 2004, BHRG’s gross loss reserves related to retroactive reinsurance policies were attributed to casualty losses. Retroactive policies include excess of loss contracts, in which losses above a contractual retention are indemnified as well as contracts that indemnify all losses paid by the counterparty after the effective date. Retroactive losses paid in 2004 totaled $860 million. The classification “reported case reserves” has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since the amount is derived from reports in bulk from ceding companies, who may have inconsistent definitions of “case reserves.” Reserves are reviewed and established in the aggregate including provisions for IBNR reserves. In establishing retroactive reinsurance reserves, historical aggregate loss payment patterns are analyzed and projected into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. Management attributes judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. Due to contractual limits of indemnification, maximum unpaid losses under retroactive policies approximated $12.2 billion as of December 31, 2004. Management cannot reasonably estimate the low-end of the retroactive reserve range given the nature of the liabilities assumed. BHRG’s liabilities for environmental, asbestos, and latent injury losses and loss adjustment expenses are presently believed to be concentrated within retroactive reinsurance contracts. Reserves for such losses were approximately $4.2 billion at December 31, 2004 and $4.4 billion at December 31, 2003. Claims paid in 2004 attributable to such losses were approximately $334 million. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not regularly receive reliable information regarding numbers of asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from ceding companies on a consistent basis, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess of loss policies. BHRG’s other property and casualty loss reserves derive from catastrophe, individual risk and multi-line reinsurance policies. Reserve amounts are based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves, which are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on an individual contract basis supplemented by management’s judgment of the impact on each contract of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon management’s judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding company’s loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared. 32 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Other Critical Accounting Policies Berkshire records as assets deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts the deferred charges represent the difference between the consideration received and the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses. No net gain or loss is recognized at the inception of the contract. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period and are reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss expenses. The deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of loss payments. Adjustments to these assumptions are applied retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges totaled $2.7 billion at December 31, 2004. Significant changes in either the timing or ultimate amount of loss payments may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization. Berkshire’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2004 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately $23 billion. These amounts have been recorded as a result of Berkshire’s numerous prior business acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method. Prior to 2002, goodwill from each acquisition was generally amortized as a charge to earnings over periods not exceeding 40 years. Under SFAS No. 142, which was adopted by Berkshire as of January 1, 2002, periodic amortization ceased, in favor of an impairment-only accounting model. A significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests. Such tests include periodically determining or reviewing the estimated fair value of Berkshire’s reporting units. Under SFAS No. 142, fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit may be bought or sold. There are several methods of estimating a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected net earnings and multiples of earnings. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then individual assets, including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is then charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Berkshire’s consolidated financial position reflects large amounts of invested assets. A substantial portion of these assets are carried at fair values based upon current market quotations and, when not available, based upon fair value pricing models. Certain fixed maturity securities Berkshire owns are not actively traded in the markets. Further, Berkshire’s finance businesses maintain significant balances of finance receivables, which are carried at amortized cost. Considerable judgment is required in determining the assumptions used in certain pricing models, including interest rate, loan prepayment speed, credit risk and liquidity risk assumptions. Significant changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on carrying values. Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements which are not yet effective is included in Note 1(r) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As indicated in Note 1(r) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Berkshire does not expect any of the recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material effect on its financial statements. Market Risk Disclosures Berkshire’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Berkshire’s significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity prices and to a lesser degree derivatives. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with Berkshire’s business activities. Interest Rate Risk Berkshire’s management prefers to invest in equity securities or to acquire entire businesses based upon the principles discussed in the following section on equity price risk. When unable to do so, management may alternatively invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Berkshire’s strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur. Berkshire has historically utilized a modest level of corporate borrowings and debt. Further, Berkshire strives to maintain the highest credit ratings so that the cost of debt is minimized. Berkshire utilizes derivative products to manage interest rate risks to a very limited degree. The fair values of Berkshire’s fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. Fixed interest rate investments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate investments. The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks. The hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions. 33 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk (Continued) Estimated Fair Value after Hypothetical Change in Interest Rates (bp=basis points) 100 bp 100 bp 200 bp 300 bp Fair Value decrease increase increase increase Insurance and other businesses: December 31, 2004 Investments in securities with fixed maturities $ 22,846 $ 23,547 $ 22,135 $ 21,450 $ 20,843 Notes payable and other borrowings 3,558 3,605 3,514 3,476 3,439 December 31, 2003 Investments in securities with fixed maturities $ 26,116 $ 27,113 $ 25,220 $ 24,333 $ 23,550 Notes payable and other borrowings 4,334 4,397 4,277 4,226 4,177 Finance and financial products businesses:* December 31, 2004 Investments in securities with fixed maturities and loans and finance receivables $ 17,909 $ 18,712 $ 17,067 $ 16,267 $ 15,507 Notes payable and other borrowings ** 10,627 10,882 10,350 10,120 9,910 December 31, 2003 Investments in securities with fixed maturities and loans and finance receivables $ 14,573 $ 14,905 $ 14,323 $ 13,987 $ 13,557 Notes payable and other borrowings ** 11,617 11,838 11,419 11,244 11,079 * Excludes General Re Securities – See Derivatives Dealer Risk section for discussion of risks associated with this business. ** Includes securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Equity Price Risk Strategically, Berkshire strives to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices. Berkshire’s management prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Accordingly, Berkshire’s equity investments are concentrated in relatively few investees. At December 31, 2004, 65% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated in four investees. Berkshire’s preferred strategy is to hold equity investments for very long periods of time. Thus, Berkshire management is not necessarily troubled by short term equity price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. Berkshire strives to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short term equity price volatility. The carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices or management’s estimates of fair value as of the balance sheet dates. Market prices are subject to fluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. Furthermore, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold. The table below summarizes Berkshire’s equity price risks as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in Berkshire’s equity investment portfolio. Dollars are in millions.

Generally, these contracts provide that Berkshire receive certain foreign currencies and pay U.S. dollars at specified exchange rates and at specified future dates. Management entered into these contracts as a partial economic hedge of the adverse effect from a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar on its net U.S. dollar-based assets. The value of these contracts changes daily due primarily to changes in the spot exchange rates and to a lesser degree, interest rates and time value. The average duration of the contracts is approximately six months. The aggregate notional value of such contracts, which are spread among 12 currencies at December 31, 2004, was approximately $21.4 billion compared to about $12.0 billion as of December 31, 2003. The fair value asset of these contracts totaled approximately $1,761 million at December 31, 2004 and $630 million at December 31, 2003. Berkshire monitors the currency positions daily for each currency. The following table summarizes the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and shows the estimated changes in values of the contracts assuming changes in the underlying exchange rates applied immediately and uniformly across all currencies. The changes in value do not necessarily reflect the best or worst case results and therefore, actual results may differ. Dollars are in millions.

Effective January 2002, GRS commenced the run-off of its business. It is expected that the run-off will take several years to complete. Since January 2002, approximately 88% of GRS’s contracts have terminated. Accordingly, derivatives market risks from the GRS portfolio declined substantially. While GRS may incur losses to unwind its remaining positions, market risks in the portfolio of derivatives at December 31, 2004 have declined significantly and as of December 31, 2004 management believes that market risks are no longer significant. However, credit risks from the potential inability of counterparties to settle amounts due to GRS remains. Management monitors counterparty credit constantly and contracts may require such exposures to be collateralized. Uncollateralized credit exposure as of December 31, 2004 totaled $2.0 billion. No significant credit losses have occurred to date. Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document, as well as some statements by the Company in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Company officials during presentations about the Company, are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects, and possible future Company actions, which may be provided by management are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions about the Company, economic and market factors and the industries in which the Company does business, among other things. These statements are not guaranties of future performance and the Company has no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal important risk factors that could cause the Company’s actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of Berkshire’s significant equity investees, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane or an act of terrorism that causes losses insured by Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries, changes in insurance laws or regulations, changes in Federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which Berkshire and its affiliates do business, especially those affecting the property and casualty insurance industry. 35 Table of Contents Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004. Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears below. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. March 2, 2005 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 of the Company and our report dated March 3, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and minority interests. Dollars are in millions. 2005 2004 2003 Insurance — underwriting $ 27 $ 1,008 $ 1,114 Insurance — investment income 2,412 2,045 2,276 Non-insurance businesses 2,160 1,913 1,745 Equity in earnings of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company 523 237 429 Interest expense, unallocated (46 ) (59 ) (59 ) Other (78 ) (95 ) (83 ) Investment and derivative gains/losses 3,530 2,259 2,729 Net earnings $ 8,528 $ 7,308 $ 8,151 Berkshire’s operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by Berkshire’s corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Berkshire’s corporate office management participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. Accordingly, Berkshire’s reportable business segments are organized in a manner that reflects how Berkshire’s top management views those business activities. Certain businesses have been grouped based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics even though those businesses are operated by separate local management. There are over 40 separate reporting units. The business segment data (Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Insurance — Underwriting A summary follows of underwriting results from Berkshire’s insurance businesses for the past three years. Dollars are in millions. 2005 2004 2003 Underwriting gain (loss) attributable to: GEICO $ 1,221 $ 970 $ 452 General Re (334 ) 3 145 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (1,069 ) 417 1,047 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 235 161 74 Pre-tax underwriting gain 53 1,551 1,718 Income taxes and minority interests 26 543 604 Net underwriting gain $ 27 $ 1,008 $ 1,114 During the third quarter of 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck the Gulf Coast region of the United States producing the largest catastrophe losses for any quarter in the history of the property/casualty insurance industry. In the fourth quarter, Hurricane Wilma struck the Southeast U.S. Estimates of Berkshire’s (including General Re, GEICO and other Berkshire subsidiaries including BHRG) pre-tax losses from these events of $3.4 billion were recorded primarily in the third quarter of 2005 and are subject to change as additional information concerning the nature and amount of losses becomes known. Berkshire engages in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks. Through General Re, Berkshire also reinsures life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, Berkshire subsidiaries assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, Berkshire subsidiaries assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Berkshire’s principal insurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, one of the four largest auto insurers in the U.S., (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. On June 30, 2005, Berkshire acquired Medical Protective Company (“Med Pro”), a provider of professional liability insurance to physicians, dentists and other healthcare providers. Underwriting results from this business are included in the Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group beginning July 1, 2005. 26 Table of Contents Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire’s management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations — underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing, with limited exceptions at GEICO and General Re’s international operations, is the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, Berkshire evaluates performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income. Periodic underwriting results can be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. See the Critical Accounting Policies section of this discussion for information concerning the loss reserve estimation process. In addition, the timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. A key marketing strategy followed by all these businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of Berkshire’s insurance businesses totaled approximately $52 billion at December 31, 2005. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers. Additional information regarding Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance operations follows. GEICO GEICO provides primarily private passenger automobile coverages to insureds in 49 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet, over the telephone or through the mail. This is a significant element in GEICO’s strategy to be a low cost insurer. In addition, GEICO strives to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICO’s underwriting results for the past three years are summarized below. Dollars are in millions. 2005 2004 2003 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 10,285 $ 9,212 $ 8,081 Premiums earned $ 10,101 100.0 $ 8,915 100.0 $ 7,784 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 7,128 70.6 6,360 71.3 5,955 76.5 Underwriting expenses 1,752 17.3 1,585 17.8 1,377 17.7 Total losses and expenses 8,880 87.9 7,945 89.1 7,332 94.2 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 1,221 * $ 970 $ 452 * Net of losses of $200 million from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Premiums earned in 2005 and 2004 increased 13.3% and 14.5%, respectively, over the corresponding prior year amounts. The growth in premiums earned in 2005 for voluntary auto was 13.3% and reflects a 12.4% increase in policies-in-force during the past year. During the third quarter of 2004, GEICO began selling auto insurance in New Jersey which contributed to the policies-in-force growth. Beginning in late 2004, rate decreases have been implemented in several states and underwriting guidelines have been adjusted to better match prices with underlying risks which has resulted in relatively lower premiums per policy. During 2005, policies-in-force increased 12.9% in the preferred risk markets and 10.7% in the standard and nonstandard markets. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2005 increased 14.0% compared to 2004. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2005 were 745,000 higher than at December 31, 2004. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2005 totaled $7,128 million, an increase of 12.1% over 2004. The loss ratio declined to 70.6% in 2005 compared to 71.3% in 2004 and 76.5% in 2003 primarily due to decreasing claim frequencies across all markets and most coverage types. In 2005, claims frequencies for physical damage coverages decreased in the two to five percent range from 2004 while frequencies for injury coverages decreased in the five to seven percent range. Injury severity in 2005 increased in the three to five percent range over 2004 while physical damage severity has increased in the five to eight percent range. Incurred losses from catastrophe events totaled approximately $227 million in 2005 (primarily from the hurricanes in the third and fourth quarters) compared to $71 million in 2004. Underwriting expenses in 2005 totaled $1,752 million, an increase of 10.5% over 2004, which increased 15.1% over 2003. Policy acquisition expenses in 2005 increased 20.1% over 2004, reflecting increased advertising, underwriting and policy issuance costs associated with the new business sales. Other underwriting expenses for 2005 decreased slightly from 2004. General Re General Re conducts a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients world-wide. In North America, property and casualty reinsurance is written on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation. Internationally, property and casualty reinsurance is written on a direct basis through 91% owned Cologne Re (based in Germany) and other wholly-owned subsidiaries as well as through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and 27 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) General Re (Continued) health reinsurance is written for clients worldwide through Cologne Re. General Re’s pre-tax underwriting results are summarized for the past three years in the following table. Amounts are in millions. Pre-tax underwriting Premiums written Premiums earned gain (loss) 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Property/casualty: North American $ 1,988 $ 2,747 $ 3,440 $ 2,201 $ 3,012 $ 3,551 $ (307 ) $ 11 $ 67 International 1,864 2,091 2,742 1,939 2,218 2,847 (138 ) (93 ) 20 Life/health 2,303 2,022 1,839 2,295 2,015 1,847 111 85 58 $ 6,155 $ 6,860 $ 8,021 $ 6,435 $ 7,245 $ 8,245 $ (334 )* $ 3 $ 145 * Includes losses of $685 million related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Property/casualty North American property/casualty premiums written in 2005 declined 27.6% from 2004 and premiums written in 2004 declined 20.1% from 2003 amounts. International property/casualty premiums written in 2005 decreased 10.9% as compared to 2004 amounts, which decreased 23.7% from the comparable 2003 amounts. The decline in both North American and International premiums written in each of the past two years is attributable to maintaining underwriting discipline by continuing to reject transactions where pricing is deemed inadequate with respect to the risk. Underwriting performance is not evaluated based upon market share and underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. The decline in North American premiums earned in 2005 was primarily due to cancellations and non-renewals exceeding new contracts, with a minimal effect from rate changes. The decline in premiums earned in 2004 from 2003 was attributable to cancellations and non-renewals over new contracts (estimated at $697 million), partially offset by rate increases across all lines (estimated at $158 million). The comparative decline in premiums earned in the International business in each of the past two years reflects reductions in premium volume. In local currencies, 2005 International premiums earned declined 12.3% from 2004, which declined 29.1% compared with 2003. The North American property/casualty business produced a pre-tax underwriting loss of $307 million in 2005 compared with underwriting gains of $11 million in 2004 and $67 million in 2003. Underwriting losses in 2005 included approximately $480 million in current accident year losses from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Otherwise, underwriting results for 2005 consisted of $220 million in current accident year gains partially offset by $47 million in prior accident years’ losses. The 2005 current accident year results (excluding hurricane losses) generally benefited from the favorable effects of re-pricing efforts and improved coverage terms and conditions put into place over the last few years. The net underwriting gain of $11 million in 2004 consisted of current accident year gains of $166 million partially offset by $155 million in prior accident year losses. The 2004 current accident year results included a one-time reduction of $70 million in underwriting expenses from the curtailment of certain pension benefits and approximately $120 million of catastrophe losses from the four hurricanes that struck the Southeast United States. Underwriting results for 2003 included net underwriting gains for the current accident year of $200 million, which reflected re-pricing efforts and unusually small amounts of large individual and catastrophe-related property losses. Offsetting these gains were $133 million in additional losses for prior accident years’ occurrences. As previously stated, 2005 North American underwriting results included $47 million in reserve increases on prior years’ loss occurrences. The increase reflected net reserve increases on workers’ compensation business ($228 million); discount accretion on workers’ compensation reserves and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance coverages ($136 million); and reserve increases on asbestos and environmental mass tort exposures ($102 million). The changing legal environment concerning asbestos and environmental losses has made estimation of potential losses very difficult. In the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge, significant increases to these reserves may be required. Offsetting the prior years’ loss reserve increases were $419 million in net reserve decreases in other casualty lines and property lines, including World Trade Center reserves of $72 million. In 2004, the $155 million prior accident years’ losses consisted of $729 million of reserve increases on casualty and workers’ compensation reserves, increased reserves of $110 million related to discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, offset by $307 million of reserve reductions for prior year property losses (primarily in World Trade Center loss exposures) and $377 million of gains from contract commutations and settlements. The increase in workers’ compensation reserves in 2004 and 2005 reflected escalating medical utilization and inflation. Casualty reserve increases in 2004 related primarily to losses under financial institutions’ errors and omissions and directors and officers’ lines of business. Underwriting results in 2003 included $133 million in losses related to prior accident years, which included $99 million from discount accretion and deferred charge amortization. 28 Table of Contents Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) General Re Property/casualty (Continued) The International property/casualty businesses produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $138 million in 2005 and $93 million in 2004 compared with a gain of $20 million in 2003. Underwriting results included catastrophe losses from U.S. hurricanes of $205 million in 2005 and $110 million in 2004. Additionally, results in 2005 included $29 million in losses from Windstorm Erwin. Losses from catastrophes and large individual property losses were minimal in 2003. Underwriting results for each of the last three years benefited from favorable results of the aviation business and relatively small non-catastrophe property losses. The International property and casualty underwriting results included gains from prior years’ loss occurrences of $108 million in 2005, compared with losses of $102 million in 2004 and $104 million in 2003. Prior years’ losses in 2004 and 2003 were primarily in motor excess, workers’ compensation and other casualty lines and also reflect reserve increases for operations placed in run-off. Although loss reserve levels are now believed to be adequate, there are no guarantees. A relatively small change in the estimate of net reserves can produce large changes in annual underwriting results. In addition, the timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual property losses are expected to continue to contribute to volatile periodic underwriting results in the future. Life and health Premiums earned in 2005 increased 13.9% over 2004, which increased 9.1% over 2003. Adjusting for the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, premiums earned increased 14.2% in 2005 and 3.7% in 2004. The increase in 2005 premiums earned reflected increases in both North American and European life business. In 2004, the increase was attributable, in part, to the strengthening of foreign currencies and an increase in European life business. Underwriting results for the global life/health operations produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $111 million in 2005, $85 million in 2004 and $58 million in 2003. Both the U.S. and International life/health operations were profitable in each of the past three years primarily due to favorable mortality; however, most of the gains were earned in the International life business. Additionally, included in the 2005 and 2004 results were $66 million and $46 million, respectively, of net losses attributable to reserve increases on certain U.S. health business in run-off. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) underwrites excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages for insurers and reinsurers world-wide. BHRG’s business includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and excess direct and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual discrete property risks referred to as individual risk. Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Other multi-line refers to other business written on both a quota-share and excess basis, and includes participations in and contracts with Lloyd’s syndicates. In addition, during the past twelve months BHRG has written increased amounts of aviation business and workers’ compensation insurance. Amounts are in millions. Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Catastrophe and individual risk $ 1,663 $ 1,462 $ 1,330 $ (1,178 ) $ 385 $ 1,108 Retroactive reinsurance 10 188 526 (214 ) (412 ) (387 ) Other multi-line 2,290 2,064 2,574 323 444 326 $ 3,963 $ 3,714 $ 4,430 $ (1,069 )* $ 417 $ 1,047 * Includes losses of $2.5 billion from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Catastrophe and individual risk contracts may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification, often several hundred million dollars and occasionally in excess of $1 billion, and cover catastrophe risks (such as hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters) or other property risks (such as aviation and aerospace, commercial multi-peril or terrorism). Catastrophe and individual risk premiums written totaled approximately $1.8 billion in 2005, $1.5 billion in 2004 and $1.2 billion in 2003. The level of business written in future periods will vary, perhaps materially, based upon market conditions and management’s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates, which is affected by industry capacity for catastrophe coverages. Underwriting results from catastrophe and individual risk business in 2005 included estimated losses of approximately $2.4 billion from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. In 2004, underwriting results from catastrophe and individual risk business included estimated catastrophe losses of $790 million from four hurricanes that struck the U.S. and Caribbean during the third quarter. The catastrophe and individual risk business produced substantial underwriting gains in 2003 due to the lack of catastrophic or otherwise large loss events. The timing and magnitude of losses may produce extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results of BHRG’s catastrophe and individual risk business. Management accepts such volatility, however, provided that the long-term prospect of achieving underwriting profits is reasonable. BHRG generally does not cede catastrophe and individual risks to other reinsurers. 29 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Retroactive policies normally provide very large, but limited, indemnification of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events, which are generally expected to be paid over long periods of time. The underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance are primarily attributed to the amortization of deferred charges established on retroactive reinsurance contracts written in previous years. The deferred charges, which represent the difference between the policy premium and the estimated ultimate claim reserves, are amortized over the expected claim payment period using the interest method. The amortization charges are recorded as losses incurred and, therefore, produce underwriting losses. The level of amortization in a given period is based upon estimates of the timing and amount of future loss payments. While contract terms vary, losses under retroactive contracts are generally subject to a very large aggregate dollar limit occasionally exceeding $1 billion under a single contract. The expected amount and timing of future loss payments is reviewed periodically. To the extent there are changes in these estimates, deferred charge balances are adjusted on a retrospective basis via a cumulative adjustment. Underwriting losses in 2005 from retroactive contracts are net of a pre-tax gain of approximately $46 million related to the final settlement of remaining unpaid losses under a certain retroactive reinsurance agreement. In addition, estimates of unpaid losses were reviewed during the fourth quarter of 2005 which resulted in a net reduction of $75 million in loss reserves. Also, rates of deferred charge amortization on certain contracts were decreased due to slower than expected loss payments. During 2004 the estimated timing of future loss payments with respect to one large contract was accelerated which produced an incremental pre-tax amortization charge of approximately $100 million. Loss payments for all retroactive contracts, including the aforementioned settlement totaled approximately $969 million in 2005 compared to $860 million in 2004. Unamortized deferred charges at December 31, 2005 totaled approximately $2.13 billion compared to $2.45 billion at year-end 2004. Management believes that these charges are reasonable with respect to the large amounts of float related to these policies, which totaled about $6.9 billion at December 31, 2005. Income generated from the investment of float is reflected in net investment income and investment gains. Premiums earned in 2005 from other multi-line reinsurance increased approximately $226 million over 2004. In 2005, increased premiums were earned from new workers’ compensation and ongoing aviation programs and were partially offset by declines in quota-share contracts. Premiums earned in 2004 from traditional multi-line reinsurance decreased $510 million compared to 2003. The comparative decrease was primarily due to declines in quota-share participations (including Lloyd’s) and the termination of a major quota-share contract in mid-2003. Pre-tax underwriting results from other multi-line reinsurance in 2005 included estimated losses of approximately $100 million from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Pre-tax underwriting results in 2004 included losses of approximately $175 million arising from the third quarter hurricanes affecting the U.S. and Caribbean. However, catastrophe losses in 2004 were more than offset by increased underwriting gains in aviation coverages and approximately $160 million in gains from the commutations of several reinsurance contracts. Underwriting gains in 2003 reflected low amounts of property and aviation losses. There were no significant commutations in 2003. The pre-tax maximum probable loss from a single event at December 31, 2005 is estimated to be $6 billion resulting from potential risk of loss from a major earthquake in California. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group Berkshire’s primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of smaller insurance businesses that principally write liability coverages for commercial accounts. These businesses include: National Indemnity Company’s primary group operation (“NICO Primary Group”), a writer of motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation (“USIC”), whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as “Homestate” operations, providers of standard multi-line insurance; Central States Indemnity Company (“CSI”), a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions; and Med Pro which was acquired as of June 30, 2005. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning this acquisition. Collectively, Berkshire’s other primary insurance businesses produced earned premiums of $1,498 million in 2005, $1,211 million in 2004, and $1,034 million in 2003. Premiums earned in 2005 by Med Pro accounted for most of the increase in total premiums earned by the group compared with 2004. The increase in premiums earned in 2004 compared to 2003 was largely attributed to increased volume of USIC and the NICO Primary Group. Net underwriting gains of Berkshire’s other primary insurance businesses totaled $235 million in 2005, $161 million in 2004, and $74 million in 2003. The underwriting gain in 2005 reflected a decrease in loss reserve estimates for pre-2005 loss events in auto and general liability business, improved results of Homestate, USIC and CSI operations, partially offset by losses incurred from increases in medical malpractice reserves. 30 Table of Contents Insurance — Investment Income Following is a summary of the net investment income of Berkshire’s insurance operations for the past three years. Dollars are in millions. 2005 2004 2003 Investment income before taxes $ 3,480 $ 2,824 $ 3,223 Applicable income taxes and minority interests 1,068 779 947 Investment income after taxes and minority interests $ 2,412 $ 2,045 $ 2,276 Investment income consists of interest and dividends earned on cash equivalents and fixed maturity and equity investments of Berkshire’s insurance businesses. Pre-tax investment income earned in 2005 by Berkshire’s insurance businesses exceeded amounts earned in 2004 by $656 million (23.2%). The increase in investment income in 2005 primarily reflects higher short-term interest rates in the United States in 2005 as compared to 2004. Investment income in 2004 declined 12.4% from 2003, reflecting relatively lower short-term interest rates and lower amounts of interest earned from high yield corporate bonds. A summary of investments held in Berkshire’s insurance businesses follows. Dollar amounts are in millions.

Dollar amounts are in millions. Unrealized Amortized cost gains/losses Fair value U.S. Treasury, government corporations and agencies $ 7,633 $ (15 ) $ 7,618 States, municipalities and political subdivisions 4,243 90 4,333 Foreign governments 6,884 77 6,961 Corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, investment grade 3,235 187 3,422 Corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, non-investment grade 2,257 1,290 3,547 Mortgage-backed securities 1,464 40 1,504 $ 25,716 $ 1,669 $ 27,385 All U.S. government obligations are rated AAA by the major rating agencies and about 95% of all state, municipal and political subdivisions, foreign government obligations and mortgage-backed securities were rated AA or higher. Non-investment grade securities represent securities that are rated below BBB- or Baa3. Fair value reflects quoted market prices where available or, if not available, prices obtained from independent pricing services. Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities assumed under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float totaled approximately $49.3 billion at December 31, 2005, $46.1 billion at December 31, 2004 and $44.2 billion at December 31, 2003. The cost of float, as represented by the ratio of pre-tax underwriting gain or loss to average float, was negative for the last three years, as Berkshire’s insurance businesses generated pre-tax underwriting gains in each year. Non-Insurance Businesses A summary follows of results from Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses for the past three years. Dollars are in millions. 2005 2004 2003 Pre-tax earnings $ 3,445 $ 3,065 $ 2,776 Income taxes and minority interests 1,285 1,152 1,031 Net earnings $ 2,160 $ 1,913 $ 1,745 31 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Non-Insurance Businesses (Continued) A comparison of revenues and pre-tax earnings between 2005, 2004 and 2003 for the non-insurance businesses follows. Dollars are in millions. Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Apparel $ 2,286 $ 2,200 $ 2,075 $ 348 $ 325 $ 289 Building products 4,806 4,337 3,846 751 643 559 Finance and financial products 4,559 3,774 3,045 822 584 619 Flight services * 3,660 3,244 2,431 120 191 72 McLane Company 24,074 23,373 13,743 217 228 150 Retail 2,759 2,601 2,311 201 163 165 Shaw Industries 5,723 5,174 4,660 485 466 436 Other businesses 3,588 3,213 3,040 501 465 486 $ 51,455 $ 47,916 $ 35,151 $ 3,445 $ 3,065 $ 2,776 * In 2004, Berkshfire adopted the provisions of EITF 00-21 (“Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables”). As a result, for consolidated reporting purposes, the method of recognizing revenue related to NetJets’ fractional aircraft sales was changed. Management continues to evaluate the results of NetJets under the prior revenue recognition criteria and thus has shown revenues and pre-tax earnings for the flight services segment using the prior revenue recognition method. Revenues shown in this table are greater than the amounts reported in Berkshire’s consolidated financial statements by $704 million in 2005 and $902 million in 2004. Pre-tax earnings included in this table for 2005 and 2004 exceed the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements by $63 million and $74 million, respectively. Apparel Apparel revenues in 2005 increased $86 million (4%) over 2004 and revenues in 2004 increased $125 million (6%) over 2003. Sales of clothing products (Fruit of the Loom (“FOL”), Garan and Fechheimer) totaled $1,754 million in 2005 an increase of $60 million (3.5%) over 2004, which was primarily attributed to a 3% increase in unit volume and changes in the sales mix of FOL products. Footwear (HH Brown Shoe Group and Justin) sales in 2005 increased $26 million (5.3%) over 2004. Increased sales were generated in Western boots and women’s casual shoes. Increased sales by FOL accounted for essentially all of the increases in 2004 over 2003, as unit sales increased 14%, partially offset by lower net selling prices. Sales to a few major retailers account for about 45% of apparel revenues. Loss or curtailment of sales to a major customer could have a material adverse impact on revenues and pre-tax earnings of the apparel segment. Pre-tax earnings of apparel businesses totaled $348 million in 2005, an increase of 7% over 2004. Almost half of the increase in pre-tax earnings in 2005 was generated by FOL due to the aforementioned sales increase, although higher advertising and plant closure costs had an adverse effect on earnings. In addition, increased earnings were achieved in the footwear businesses. Building products Building products revenues in 2005 totaled $4,806 million, an increase of $469 million (11%) over 2004. Increased sales volume was generated in all significant product lines in 2005, including insulation and roofing products (Johns Manville-10%), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore-5%), brick and masonry (Acme-11%) and steel connector plates and truss machinery (MiTek-22%). Berkshire’s building products businesses have benefited in recent periods by relatively strong residential housing market conditions. The increases in revenues in 2005 were primarily driven by higher average selling prices for most products, which in most instances were precipitated by comparatively higher materials, production and delivery costs, particularly for steel, petrochemicals and energy. Pre-tax earnings of the building products group in 2005 exceeded earnings in 2004 by $108 million (17%), reflecting increased earnings from insulation and roofing products, connector plate/truss machinery and bricks partially offset by lower earnings from paints and coatings. Over the past year, Berkshire’s building products businesses have instituted price increases to compensate for rising raw material and energy related production and transportation costs. Nevertheless, certain costs essential to the production processes, including natural gas (brick and insulation), steel (connector plates) and petrochemicals (paint and coatings) are increasingly subject to rapid price changes and constraints in availability for a variety of reasons. In addition, rapid rises in interest rates could adversely affect housing construction which could result in declining sales for Berkshire’s building products businesses. The pre-tax results for 2003 included a loss of $21 million from a fire at a Johns Manville pipe insulation plant. 32 Table of Contents Non-Insurance Businesses (Continued) Finance and financial products A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings from Berkshire’s finance and financial products businesses follows. Dollar amounts are in millions. Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Manufactured housing and finance $ 3,175 $ 2,024 $ 512 $ 416 $ 192 $ 34 Furniture/transportation equipment leasing 856 789 750 173 92 34 Other 528 961 1,783 233 300 551 $ 4,559 $ 3,774 $ 3,045 $ 822 $ 584 $ 619 The increase in revenues in 2005 from manufactured housing and finance activities of Clayton Homes (“Clayton”) was primarily attributed to increased sales of manufactured homes ($491 million) and increased interest income ($583 million) from comparatively higher installment loan balances. Installment loan balances have increased approximately $8.5 billion from the date of Berkshire’s acquisition on August 7, 2003 to $9.6 billion as of December 31, 2005, reflecting the impact of several loan portfolio acquisitions as well as loan originations. Clayton’s results are included in Berkshire’s consolidated financial statements beginning as of the acquisition date. Pre-tax earnings from Clayton’s manufactured housing and finance activities totaled $416 million in 2005, an increase of $224 million (117%) over 2004. The significant increase in pre-tax earnings is primarily due to higher interest income from the increase in acquired loan portfolios during 2004 and 2005, partially offset by higher interest expense derived from Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation, an affiliate that has issued approximately $8.8 billion par of medium term notes to finance the aforementioned increase in installment loans. In addition, improved comparative results in the manufacturing and retail segments of Clayton’s business contributed to the overall earnings growth. Furniture and transportation equipment leasing revenues in 2005 primarily reflect increased rental income. Pre-tax earnings from furniture and transportation equipment leasing activities in 2005 increased $81 million over 2004, reflecting higher rental income and lower administrative and interest expenses. Other finance revenues in 2005 and 2004 are primarily derived from interest income from other loans and fixed income investments and the operations of General Re Securities (“GRS”) which is being run-off. In 2003, other finance revenues included life insurance annuity premiums of $700 million arising from a few sizable transactions. Annuity premiums generated in 2005 and 2004 were nominal. Other finance revenues in 2004 also included $282 million from the consolidation of Value Capital L.P. (“VC”) during the first six months. As a result of a significant decline in the percentage of Berkshire’s economic interest in VC, Berkshire ceased consolidation of VC effective July 1, 2004 and thereafter accounted for its investment in VC pursuant to the equity method. Pre-tax earnings from other finance activities in 2005 were $233 million, a decrease of $67 million from 2004. Berkshire’s investment in VC produced a pre-tax loss in 2005 of $33 million compared to a pre-tax gain of $30 million in 2004. GRS generated pre-tax losses of $104 million in 2005 and $44 million in 2004. The increase in GRS losses was due to higher losses from unwinding derivative positions. In 2005, pre-tax earnings attributed to the life insurance/annuity business exceeded 2004 by $68 million as a result of higher short-term interest rates and the absence of adverse effects from changes to mortality estimates pertaining to annuity contracts. Pre-tax earnings from other finance activities in 2004 declined approximately $251 million from 2003 primarily as a result of comparatively lower amounts of invested assets. In addition, pre-tax earnings for 2004 were negatively impacted by higher allocations of investments in low-yielding cash and cash equivalents, a significant reduction in the early redemptions of fixed-income securities purchased at a discount and adverse effects from changes in mortality assumptions. Flight services Flight service revenues in 2005 increased $416 million (13%) over 2004, which, in turn, increased $813 million (33%) over 2003. In 2005, revenues of the training business (FlightSafety) and the fractional ownership business (NetJets) each increased 13% over revenues in 2004. In 2005, the increase in training revenue was primarily due to increased simulator usage and increased demand, primarily in the corporate aviation and regional airline markets. The fractional ownership program revenue increase in 2005 over 2004 reflected an 18% increase in flight operations and management service fees. The increase in flight operations revenue primarily resulted from a 7% increase in occupied flight hours, rate increases and a higher mix of larger cabin aircraft usage, which generate higher revenues. Over 90% of the revenue increase in 2004 over 2003 resulted from the NetJets business where flight operations revenue increased just under $400 million and revenues from aircraft sales increased about $360 million. NetJets and FlightSafety continue to be leaders in the aircraft fractional ownership and training markets. Pre-tax earnings of the flight services businesses totaled $120 million in 2005, a decrease of $71 million as compared to 2004. In 2005, pre-tax earnings from the FlightSafety training business, increased approximately 10% over 2004 to approximately $200 million, due primarily to the impact of increased training revenues and simulator sales. NetJets incurred a pre-tax loss of about $80 million in 2005 compared to pre-tax income of about $10 million in 2004. Several factors contributed to the loss in 2005. Throughout 2005, NetJets experienced unusually high shortages of available aircraft due to increases in 33 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Flight services (Continued) owner demand outpacing increases in capacity. Consequently, NetJets subcontracted additional aircraft capacity through charter services. The costs associated with subcontracted flights were not fully recoverable from clients and caused an incremental pre-tax cost of approximately $85 million in 2005. NetJets has added aircraft to the core fleet and is developing strategies to address capacity issues and restore profitability. NetJets recorded a special charge of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 for prior periods’ compensation related to a new labor contract with its pilots and flight attendants. Additionally, interest expense in 2005 increased approximately $23 million due to higher interest rates. McLane Company On May 23, 2003, Berkshire acquired McLane Company, Inc., (“McLane”) a distributor of grocery and food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. Results of McLane’s business operations are included in Berkshire’s consolidated results beginning on that date. McLane’s revenues in 2005 totaled $24.1 billion compared to $23.4 billion in 2004 and approximately $22.0 billion for the full year of 2003. Sales of grocery products increased about 5% in 2005 and were partially offset by lower sales to foodservice customers. McLane’s business is marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins. Pre-tax earnings in 2005 of $217 million declined $11 million versus 2004. The gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged between years. However, the resulting increased gross profit was more than offset by higher payroll, fuel and insurance expenses. Approximately 33% of McLane’s annual revenues currently derive from sales to Wal-Mart. Loss or curtailment of purchasing by Wal-Mart could have a material adverse impact on revenues and pre-tax earnings of McLane. Retail Berkshire’s retail operations consist of several home furnishings and jewelry retailers. Aggregate revenues in 2005 increased $158 million (6%) over 2004. Revenues of the home furnishings businesses were $1,958 million in 2005 and $1,843 million in 2004 and jewelry revenues were $801 million in 2005 as compared to $758 million in 2004. Aggregate same store sales in 2005 increased approximately 2.5% compared to 2004. In addition, the revenue increase was as a result of new store sales at R.C. Willey and Jordan’s. Pre-tax earnings in 2005 of the retail group totaled $201 million, an increase of $38 million (23%) over 2004. Approximately 90% of the comparative increase in pre-tax earnings was produced by the home furnishings businesses. Total revenues attributed to retail operations were $2,601 million in 2004, an increase of $290 million (13%) over 2003. Same store sales in 2004 increased 2.4% from 2003. Pre-tax earnings of the retail group totaled $163 million in 2004 compared to $165 million in 2003. The increase in sales was substantially offset by higher costs associated with new home furnishings stores, including increased salaries and benefits, depreciation and distribution costs. Shaw Industries Revenues of Shaw Industries of $5,723 million in 2005 increased $549 million (11%) over 2004. The increase in 2005 reflected increases in average net selling prices for carpet and a very small increase in yards of carpet sold. During 2005, sales of rugs also increased over 2004. Pre-tax earnings in 2005 increased $19 million (4%) over 2004. Despite the increases in selling prices, operating margins in 2005 were adversely affected by repeated increases in petroleum-based raw material costs. Consequently, increases in production costs have, generally, outpaced increases in average net selling prices over the past two years. In addition, product sample costs pertaining to the introduction of new products increased approximately $29 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. Revenues generated by Shaw Industries in 2004 increased $514 million (11%) over 2003 due to a 9% increase in square yards of carpet sold, higher net selling prices and increased hard surface and rug sales. In addition, sales in 2004 include two businesses acquired by Shaw in 2003 (Georgia Tufters and the North Georgia operations of the Dixie Group). These acquisitions contributed sales of $240 million in 2004 and $50 million in 2003. Pre-tax earnings in 2004 totaled $466 million, an increase of $30 million (7%) over 2003. Sales price increases lagged raw material supplier price increases resulting in a decline in gross margins during 2004 as compared to 2003. Equity in Earnings of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company Earnings from MidAmerican represent Berkshire’s share of MidAmerican’s net earnings as determined under the equity method. In 2005, Berkshire’s share of MidAmerican’s net earnings was $523 million versus $237 million in 2004. MidAmerican’s 2004 results include an after-tax charge of $340 million (of which Berkshire’s share was about $255 million) to write down certain assets of an operation that was shut down in the third quarter and a gain of $44 million (Berkshire’s share was about $33 million) from the realization of certain Enron-related bankruptcy claims. In 2005, MidAmerican benefited from favorable comparative results at most of its domestic businesses and from gains on sales of certain non-strategic assets and investments. These improvements were partially offset by lower earnings from the U.K. electricity business. Ignoring the effect of the aforementioned two non-recurring events, Berkshire’s share of MidAmerican’s 2004 net earnings was $459 million, which, when compared with 2003 results, reflects improved results at most of MidAmerican’s major operating units. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding MidAmerican. 34 Table of Contents Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses follows. Dollar amounts are in millions. 2005 2004 2003 Investment gains/losses from - Sales and other disposals of investments - Insurance and other $ 5,831 $ 1,527 $ 2,873 Finance and financial products 544 61 338 Other-than-temporary impairments (114 ) (19 ) (289 ) Life settlement contracts (82 ) (207 ) — Other 17 267 374 6,196 1,629 3,296 Derivative gains/losses from - Foreign currency forward contracts (955 ) 1,839 825 Other 253 21 — (702 ) 1,860 825 Gains/losses before income taxes and minority interests 5,494 3,489 4,121 Income taxes and minority interests 1,964 1,230 1,392 Net gains/losses $ 3,530 $ 2,259 $ 2,729 Investment gains or losses are recognized upon the sales of investments or as otherwise required under GAAP. The timing of realized gains or losses from sales can have a material effect on periodic earnings. However, such gains or losses usually have little, if any, impact on total shareholders’ equity because most equity and fixed maturity investments are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gain or loss included as a component of other comprehensive income. For many years, Berkshire held an investment in common stock of The Gillette Company (“Gillette”). The Procter & Gamble Company (“PG”) completed its acquisition of Gillette on October 1, 2005. On that date, PG issued 0.975 shares of common stock for each outstanding share of Gillette common stock. Berkshire recognized a non-cash pre-tax investment gain of approximately $5 billion upon the conversion of the Gillette shares for PG shares. Berkshire’s management does not regard the gain that was recorded, as required by GAAP, as meaningful. Berkshire intends to hold the shares of PG just as it has held the Gillette shares. The gain recognized for financial reporting purposes is deferred for income tax purposes. The transaction essentially had no effect on Berkshire’s consolidated shareholders’ equity because the gain included in earnings in the fourth quarter was accompanied by a corresponding reduction of unrealized investment gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of September 30, 2005. The other-than-temporary impairment losses reflected in the table above represent the adjustment of cost to fair value when, as required by GAAP, management concludes that the investment’s decline in value below cost is other than temporary. The impairment loss represents a non-cash charge to earnings. See Note 1(d) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the factors considered in the judgment process. Gains and losses from the ultimate sale of securities in which other-than-temporary impairments were previously recorded are included in sales of investments. Prior to January 1, 2004, Berkshire accounted for investments in life settlement contracts on the cost basis, which included the initial purchase price plus subsequent periodic maintenance costs. Beginning in 2004, as a result of obtaining information that suggested the SEC believed a different accounting method should be used, life settlement investments are accounted for under FASB Technical Bulletin (“FTB”) 85-4 “Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance.” Under FTB 85-4, the life settlement contracts are carried at the cash surrender value of the contract. The excess of the cash paid to purchase these contracts over the cash surrender value at the date of purchase is recognized as a loss immediately and periodic maintenance costs, such as premiums necessary to keep the underlying policies in force, are charged to earnings immediately. The pre-tax loss in 2004 included $73 million with respect to life settlement contracts held at December 31, 2003. Despite the accounting loss recorded for these contracts, management believes the current value of the contracts is no less than the cost basis and believes these contracts will produce satisfactory earnings. Derivative gains and losses from foreign currency forward contracts arise as the value of the U.S. dollar changes against certain foreign currencies. Small changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates produce material changes in the fair value of these contracts and consequently can produce exceptional volatility in reported earnings. The potential for such volatility declined in 2005 as the notional value of open contracts declined approximately $7.6 billion to $13.8 billion as of December 31, 2005. During 2005, the value of most foreign currencies decreased relative to the U.S. dollar. Thus, forward contracts produced pre-tax losses. Conversely, the value of many foreign currencies rose relative to the U.S. dollar in 2004 and 2003, and Berkshire’s contract positions produced significant pre-tax gains. During 2004 and 2005, Berkshire has also entered into other derivative contracts pertaining to credit default risks of other entities as well as equity price risk associated with major equity indexes. Such contracts are carried at estimated fair value and the change in estimated fair value is included in earnings in the period of the change. These contracts are not traded on an exchange and independent market prices are not consistently available. Accordingly, considerable judgment is required in estimating fair value. 35 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Financial Condition Berkshire’s balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2005 totaled $91.5 billion. Consolidated cash and invested assets, excluding assets of finance and financial products businesses, totaled approximately $115.6 billion at December 31, 2005 (including cash and cash equivalents of $40.5 billion) and $102.9 billion at December 31, 2004 (including $40.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents). Berkshire’s invested assets are held predominantly in its insurance businesses. On June 30, 2005, Berkshire acquired Med Pro from an affiliate of General Electric Company. Med Pro is a primary medical malpractice insurer. On August 31, 2005, Berkshire acquired Forest River, Inc., a manufacturer of recreational vehicles sold in the United States and Canada. In addition, a few other smaller add on acquisitions were completed by Berkshire subsidiaries during 2005. Aggregate consideration paid for all acquisitions in 2005 was approximately $2.4 billion. Berkshire’s consolidated notes payable and other borrowings, excluding borrowings of finance businesses, totaled $3.6 billion at December 31, 2005 and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2004. During 2005, commercial paper and short-term borrowings of subsidiaries increased $242 million, due primarily to borrowings of NetJets to acquire additional aircraft. Additionally, borrowings under investment contracts increased $250 million during 2005 due to a new contract which matures in 2007. In May 2002, Berkshire issued the SQUARZ securities, which consist of $400 million par amount of senior notes due in November 2007 together with warrants to purchase 4,464 Class A equivalent shares of Berkshire common stock, which expire in May 2007. A warrant premium is payable to Berkshire at an annual rate of 3.75% and interest is payable to note holders at a rate of 3.00%. Each warrant provides the holder the right to purchase either 0.1116 shares of Class A or 3.348 shares of Class B stock for $10,000. In addition, holders of the senior notes have the option to require Berkshire to repurchase the senior notes at par on May 15, 2006, provided that the holders also surrender a corresponding amount of warrants for cancellation. To date, no warrants have been exercised and $64 million par of notes have been redeemed. On February 9, 2006, Berkshire obtained control of MidAmerican for financial reporting purposes. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information concerning MidAmerican. In addition, MidAmerican expects to complete its acquisition of PacifiCorp in March 2006 for approximately $5.1 billion, at which time Berkshire will acquire additional shares of MidAmerican for $3.4 billion thereby increasing its ownership interest to 88.6% (86.5% diluted). MidAmerican intends to issue additional debt or other securities for the remainder of the purchase price. Berkshire has not provided and does not intend to guaranty debt issued by MidAmerican or its subsidiaries. However, Berkshire has made a commitment that allows MidAmerican to request up to $3.5 billion of capital until February 28, 2011 to pay its debt obligations or to provide funding to its regulated subsidiaries. Total assets of the finance and financial products businesses totaled $24.5 billion as of December 31, 2005, and $31.0 billion at December 31, 2004. Liabilities totaled $20.3 billion as of December 31, 2005, and $20.4 billion at December 31, 2004. During 2005, significant declines in investments in fixed maturity securities ($5.0 billion) resulted from sales and disposals and were offset by a decline ($4.6 billion) in securities sold under repurchase agreements. A $3.4 billion decline in derivative contract assets was the result of a large reduction in derivative contracts outstanding, including the ongoing run-off of the remaining positions of GRS. The asset reductions were partially offset by declines in liabilities to counterparties for funds held as collateral. Derivative contract liabilities increased slightly in 2005 as declines in liabilities due to the run-off of GRS were offset by increases in liabilities established with respect to other derivative positions of another Berkshire subsidiary. Cash and cash equivalents of finance and financial products businesses totaled $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2005 and $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2004. During 2004, manufactured housing loans of Clayton increased approximately $5.0 billion to $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2004 and as of December 31, 2005 further increased to $9.6 billion. The increases were primarily attributed to loan portfolio acquisitions during 2004 and 2005. Prior to its acquisition by Berkshire in August 2003, Clayton securitized and sold a significant portion of its installment loans through special purpose entities. In early 2003, Clayton discontinued its loan securitizations and sales. Notes payable and other borrowings of Berkshire’s finance and financial products businesses totaled $10.9 billion at December 31, 2005 and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2004. During 2005, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”) issued a total of $5.25 billion par amount of medium term notes. The proceeds of these issues were used to finance originated and acquired loans of Clayton. Medium term notes issued by BHFC ($8.85 billion in the aggregate) are guaranteed by Berkshire. Berkshire believes that it currently maintains sufficient liquidity to cover its existing contractual obligations and provide for contingent liquidity. Contractual Obligations Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Notes payable and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements along with accrued but unpaid interest as of the balance sheet date. In addition, Berkshire will be obligated to pay interest under debt obligations for periods subsequent to the balance sheet date. Although certain principal balances may be prepaid in advance of the maturity date, thus reducing future interest 36 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations (Continued) obligations, it is assumed that no principal prepayments will occur for purposes of this disclosure. Further, while short-term borrowings and repurchase agreements are currently expected to be renewed as they mature, such amounts are not assumed to renew for purposes of this disclosure. Berkshire and subsidiaries are also parties to long-term contracts to acquire goods or services in the future, which are not currently reflected in the financial statements. Such obligations, including future minimum rentals under operating leases, will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date. Contractual obligations for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are estimates. The timing and amount of such payments are contingent upon the ultimate outcome of claim settlements that will occur over many years. The amounts presented in the following table have been estimated based upon past claim settlement activities. The timing and amount of such payments are subject to significant estimation error. The factors affecting the ultimate amount of claims are discussed in the following section regarding Berkshire’s critical accounting policies. Accordingly, the actual timing and amount of payments may differ materially from the amounts shown in the table. A summary of long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 follows. Amounts represent estimates of gross undiscounted amounts payable over time. In addition, certain losses and loss adjustment expenses for property and casualty loss reserves are ceded to others under reinsurance contracts and therefore are recoverable. Such potential recoverables are not reflected in the table. Amounts are in millions.

Amounts recognized in the financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on numerous assumptions involving varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, the amounts currently reflected in the financial statements will likely increase or decrease in the future as additional information becomes available. Property and casualty losses A summary of Berkshire’s consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Except for certain workers’ compensation reserves, liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as “gross unpaid losses”) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value, regardless of the length of the claim-tail. Dollars are in millions. Gross unpaid losses Net unpaid losses* Dec. 31, 2005 Dec. 31, 2004 Dec. 31, 2005 Dec. 31, 2004 GEICO $ 5,578 $ 5,112 $ 5,285 $ 4,867 General Re 21,524 22,258 20,429 20,056 BHRG 17,202 16,235 14,577 13,132 Berkshire Hathaway Primary 3,730 1,614 3,271 1,542 Total $ 48,034 $ 45,219 $ 43,562 $ 39,597 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges reinsurance assumed and before foreign currency translation effects. 37 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire records liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts with respect to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. Depending on the type of loss being estimated, the timing and amount of property and casualty loss payments are subject to a great degree of variability and are contingent, among other things, upon the timing of the claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the determination and payment of the ultimate loss amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used to establish and review the liabilities for unpaid losses recorded as of the balance sheet date. While techniques may vary, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amount payable in the future with respect to loss events that have occurred. As of any balance sheet date, claims that have occurred have not all been reported, and if reported may not have been settled. The time period between the occurrence date and payment date of a loss is referred to as the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within no more than a few years after occurrence. Casualty losses usually have very long claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal environment which contributes to extended claim-tails. Claim-tails for reinsurers may be further extended due to delayed reporting by ceding insurers or reinsurers due to contractual provisions or reporting practices. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include provisions for those claims that have been reported (referred to as “case reserves”) and for those claims that have not been reported, referred to as incurred but not yet reported (“IBNR”) reserves. Receivables recorded with respect to insurance losses ceded to other reinsurers under reinsurance contracts are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses and, therefore, are also subject to estimation error. In addition to the factors cited above, reinsurance recoverables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders. Each of Berkshire’s insurance businesses utilize techniques for establishing reserves that are believed to best fit the business. Additional information regarding reserves established by each of the significant businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows. GEICO GEICO’s gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves as of December 31, 2005 totaled $5,578 million and net of reinsurance recoverables were $5,285 million. As of December 31, 2005, gross reserves included $3,910 million of case reserves and $1,668 million of IBNR reserves. GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance which has a relatively short claim-tail. Accordingly, the risk of estimation error is thought to be much less at GEICO than for either General Re or BHRG. The key assumptions affecting GEICO’s reserves include projections of ultimate claim counts and average loss per claim (“severity”), which includes loss adjustment expenses. GEICO’s reserving methodologies produce reserve estimates based upon the individual claims (or a “ground-up” approach), which in the aggregate yields a point estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Ranges of loss estimates are not calculated in the aggregate. A detailed discussion of the process and significant factors considered in establishing reserves follows. Actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserves using recognized standard statistical loss development methods and techniques. The significant reserve components (and percentage of gross reserves) are: (1) average reserves (20%), (2) case and case development reserves (50%), and (3) IBNR reserves (30%). Each component of loss reserves is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. Such amounts are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, jurisdiction of loss, reporting date and occurrence date, among other factors. A brief discussion of each component follows. Average reserve amounts are established for auto damage claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. Average reserve amounts are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened. The average severity per claim amount is developed by projecting the ultimate severity for each accident quarter and weighting with both reported claims and unreported claims. Claim adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as soon as the specific facts and merits of each claim can be evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised as more information becomes known. For most liability coverages, case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim-tail, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is established. Therefore, additional case development reserve estimates are established, usually as a percentage of the case reserve. In general, case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves. Case development factors are reviewed and revised periodically. 38 Table of Contents Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts, to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are subtracted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established. For each of its major coverages, GEICO tests the adequacy of the total loss reserves using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. GEICO’s exposure to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining reserves associated with such exposure is currently a relatively insignificant component of GEICO’s total reserves (3%) and there is little, if any, apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure. Related claim activity over the past year was insignificant. General Re General Re’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2005 are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Workers’ Property Compensation Casualty Total Reported case reserves $ 1,968 $ 2,199 $ 7,768 $ 11,935 IBNR reserves 1,479 1,019 7,091 9,589 Gross reserves $ 3,447 $ 3,218 $ 14,859 21,524 Ceded reserves and deferred charges (1,095 ) Net reserves $ 20,429 General Re’s process of establishing loss reserve estimates is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (“ACR’s”) and IBNR reserves. Critical judgments in the establishment of these loss reserves involve the establishment of ACR’s by claim examiners, the expectation of ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and the case reserve reporting trends compared to the expected loss reporting patterns. The company does not routinely calculate loss reserve ranges because it believes that the techniques necessary have not sufficiently developed and the myriad of assumptions required render such resulting ranges to be unreliable. In addition, counts of claims or average amount per claim are not utilized because clients do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail. General Re claim examiners establish case reserve estimates based on the facts and circumstances of the claims and the terms and provisions of the insurance and reinsurance contracts. For reinsurance claims, claim examiners receive notices from client companies in a manner that reflects the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Contract terms governing claim reporting are generally based on the client’s view of the case loss (e.g., claims with reserves greater than one-half the retention) or injury type (e.g., any claim arising from a fatality). Some reinsurance contracts, such as quota-share contracts, permit claims to be reported on a bulk basis. Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners’ estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners’ estimates are significantly greater than the ceding company’s estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACR’s are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. Examiners also conduct claim reviews at client companies periodically and case reserves are often increased as a result. In 2005, claim examiners conducted in excess of 400 claim reviews. Actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (reserve cells) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative, and program) and line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, etc.). For each reserve cell, losses are aggregated by accident year and analyzed over time. Depending on client reporting practices, some losses and premiums are aggregated by policy year. These loss aggregations are called loss triangles, which are the primary basis for IBNR reserve calculations. North American operations presently review over 300 reserve cells and the International operations presently review about 900 reserve cells. 39 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) Loss triangles are used to determine the expected case loss emergence patterns and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, are further used to determine IBNR reserves. Additional calculations form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern. The determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly a mechanical process. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, estimation formulas are used along with reliance on other loss triangles and judgment. Factors affecting loss development triangles include but are not limited to the following: changing client claims practices, changes in claim examiners use of ACR’s or the frequency of client company claim reviews, changes in policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. These items influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns. Expected loss ratios are selected by reserve cell, by accident year, based upon reviewing indicated ultimate loss ratios predicted from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premium. If the selected emergence pattern is not accurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios will not be correct and this can influence the selected loss ratios and hence the IBNR reserve. As with selected loss emergence patterns, selecting expected loss ratios is not a strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing loss ratios. IBNR reserves are estimated by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence pattern and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are generally updated every year-end. Once the year-end IBNR reserves are determined, actuaries calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year. This calculation does not involve new assumptions and uses the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year. In certain reserve cells (such as excess directors and officers and errors and omissions) IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses, without consideration of expected emergence patterns. These cells typically involve a spike in loss activity arising from recent industry developments making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern as has been experienced from the recent wave of corporate scandals that have caused an increase in reported losses. Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for asbestos and hazardous waste claims. Unpaid environmental, asbestos and mass tort reserves at December 31, 2005 were approximately $1.8 billion gross and $1.3 billion net of reinsurance. Such reserves were approximately $1.6 billion gross and $1.3 billion net of reinsurance as of December 31, 2004. Claims paid attributable to such losses were about $93 million in 2005. BHRG BHRG’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2005 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions. Property Casualty Total Reported case reserves $ 3,860 $ 1,476 $ 5,336 IBNR reserves 997 1,900 2,897 Retroactive — 8,969 8,969 Gross reserves $ 4,857 $ 12,345 17,202 Ceded reserves and deferred charges (2,625 ) Net reserves $ 14,577 As of December 31, 2005, BHRG’s gross loss reserves related to retroactive reinsurance policies were attributed to casualty losses. Retroactive policies include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses (relating to past loss events) above a contractual retention are indemnified or contracts that indemnify all losses paid by the counterparty after the policy effective date. Retroactive losses paid in 2005 totaled $969 million. The classification “reported case reserves” has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since the amount is derived from reports in bulk from ceding companies, who may have inconsistent definitions of “case reserves.” Reserves are reviewed and established in the aggregate including provisions for IBNR reserves. In establishing retroactive reinsurance reserves, historical aggregate loss payment patterns are analyzed and projected into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. Management attributes judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. Due to contractual limits of indemnification, the maximum losses payable under retroactive policies are approximately $11.5 billion as of December 31, 2005. 40 Table of Contents Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG (Continued) BHRG’s liabilities for environmental, asbestos, and latent injury losses and loss adjustment expenses are presently believed to be concentrated within retroactive reinsurance contracts. Reserves for such losses were approximately $4.0 billion at December 31, 2005 and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2004. Claims paid in 2005 attributable to such losses were approximately $273 million. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not regularly receive reliable information regarding numbers of asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from ceding companies on a consistent basis, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess of loss policies. BHRG’s other property and casualty loss reserves derive from catastrophe, individual risk and multi-line reinsurance policies. Reserve amounts are based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves, which are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on an individual contract basis supplemented by management’s judgment of the impact on each contract of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon management’s judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding company’s loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared. Other Critical Accounting Policies Berkshire records as assets deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the difference between the consideration received and the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period and are reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss expenses. The deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of loss payments. Adjustments to these assumptions are applied retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges totaled $2.4 billion at December 31, 2005. Significant changes in the amount and payment timing of estimated unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization. Berkshire’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately $23.6 billion. A significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests. Such tests include periodically determining or reviewing the estimated fair value of Berkshire’s reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings and multiples of earnings. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then individual assets, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is then charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Berkshire’s consolidated financial position reflects very significant amounts of invested assets. A substantial portion of these assets are carried at fair values based upon current market quotations and, when not available, based upon fair value pricing models. Certain of Berkshire’s fixed maturity securities are not actively traded in the financial markets. Further, Berkshire’s finance businesses maintain significant balances of finance receivables, which are carried at amortized cost. Considerable judgment is required in determining the assumptions used in certain pricing models, including interest rate, loan prepayment speed, credit risk and liquidity risk assumptions. Significant changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on carrying values. Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements which are not yet effective is included in Note 1(r) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As indicated in Note 1(r) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Berkshire does not expect any of the recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material effect on its financial statements. Market Risk Disclosures Berkshire’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Berkshire’s significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with Berkshire’s business activities. Interest Rate Risk Berkshire’s management prefers to invest in equity securities or to acquire entire businesses based upon the principles discussed in the following section on equity price risk. When unable to do so, management may alternatively invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Berkshire’s strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur. Berkshire has historically utilized a modest level of corporate borrowings and debt. Further, Berkshire strives to maintain the highest credit ratings so that the cost of debt is minimized. Berkshire utilizes derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks on a limited basis. 41 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Interest Rate Risk (Continued) The fair values of Berkshire’s fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. Fixed interest rate investments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate investments. The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk. The hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Equity Price Risk Strategically, Berkshire strives to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices. Berkshire’s management prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Accordingly, Berkshire’s equity investments are concentrated in relatively few investees. At December 31, 2005, 59% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated in four investees. Berkshire’s preferred strategy is to hold equity investments for very long periods of time. Thus, Berkshire’s management is not troubled by short term equity price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. Berkshire strives to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short-term equity price volatility. The carrying values of investments subject to equity price risk are, in almost all instances, based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet dates. Market prices are subject to fluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. Furthermore, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold. The table which follows summarizes Berkshire’s equity price risk as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in Berkshire’s equity investment portfolio. Dollars are in millions. 42 Table of Contents Equity Price Risk (Continued) Estimated Hypothetical Fair Value after Percentage Hypothetical Hypothetical Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value Price Change Change in Prices Shareholders’ Equity As of December 31, 2005 $ 46,721 30% increase $ 60,737 9.9 30% decrease 32,705 (9.9) As of December 31, 2004 $ 37,717 30% increase $ 49,032 8.5 30% decrease 26,402 (8.5) Berkshire is also subject to equity price risk with respect to certain long duration equity index put contracts. Berkshire’s maximum exposure with respect to such contracts is approximately $14 billion at December 31, 2005. These contracts generally expire 15 to 20 years from inception. Outstanding contracts at December 31, 2005, have been written on four major equity indexes including three foreign. Berkshire’s potential exposure with respect to these contracts is directly correlated to the movement of the underlying stock index between contract inception date and expiration. Thus, if the overall value at December 31, 2005 of the underlying indices decline 30%, Berkshire would incur a pre-tax loss of approximately $900 million. Foreign Currency Risk Berkshire’s market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates are concentrated primarily in a portfolio of short duration foreign currency forward contracts. Generally, these contracts provide that Berkshire receive certain foreign currencies and pay U.S. dollars at specified exchange rates at specified future dates. Management entered into these contracts as a partial economic hedge of the adverse effect from a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar on its net U.S. dollar-based assets. The value of these contracts changes daily due primarily to changes in the spot exchange rates and to a lesser degree, interest rates and time value. The average duration of the contracts is approximately one and a half months. The aggregate notional value of such contracts, in nine currencies at December 31, 2005, was approximately $13.8 billion compared to about $21.4 billion as of December 31, 2004. Berkshire monitors the currency positions daily. The following table summarizes the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and shows the estimated changes in values of the contracts assuming changes in the underlying exchange rates applied immediately and uniformly across all currencies. The changes in value do not necessarily reflect the best or worst case results and actual results may differ. Dollars are in millions.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 43 Table of Contents Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005. Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears below. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. March 1, 2006 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 of the Company and our report dated March 2, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows.

There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by Berkshire’s corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Berkshire’s corporate office management participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Insurance — Underwriting A summary follows of underwriting results from Berkshire’s insurance businesses for the past three years. Amounts are in millions. 2006 2005 2004 Underwriting gain (loss) attributable to: GEICO $ 1,314 $ 1,221 $ 970 General Re 526 (334 ) 3 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 1,658 (1,069 ) 417 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 340 235 161 Pre-tax underwriting gain 3,838 53 1,551 Income taxes and minority interests 1,353 26 543 Net underwriting gain $ 2,485 $ 27 $ 1,008 Berkshire engages in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks. Through General Re, Berkshire also reinsures life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, Berkshire subsidiaries assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, Berkshire subsidiaries assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Berkshire’s principal insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, one of the four largest auto insurers in the U.S., (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. On June 30, 2005, Berkshire acquired Medical Protective Corporation (“MedPro”), a provider of professional liability insurance to physicians, dentists and other healthcare providers. On May 19, 2006, Berkshire acquired 85% of Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers’ compensation solutions. Underwriting results for these businesses are included in the Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group results beginning on their respective acquisition dates. Berkshire’s management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations — underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing, with limited exceptions at GEICO and General Re’s international operations, is the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, Berkshire evaluates performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income. Periodic underwriting results can be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. See the Critical Accounting Policies section of this discussion for information concerning the loss reserve estimation process. In addition, the timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. During the third quarter of 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck the Gulf Coast region of the United States producing the largest catastrophe losses for any quarter in the history of the property/casualty insurance industry. In the fourth quarter of 2005, Hurricane Wilma struck the Southeast U.S. Estimated pre-tax losses from these events of $3.4 billion were recorded in 2005. In contrast, there were no major hurricanes in 2006. 29 Table of Contents Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) A key marketing strategy followed by all of these businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of Berkshire’s insurance businesses was approximately $59 billion at December 31, 2006. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers. Additional information regarding Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance operations follows. GEICO GEICO provides primarily private passenger automobile coverages to insureds in 49 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet, over the telephone or through the mail. This is a significant element in GEICO’s strategy to be a low-cost insurer. In addition, GEICO strives to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICO’s underwriting results for the past three years are summarized below. Dollars are in millions. 2006 2005 2004 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 11,303 $ 10,285 $ 9,212 Premiums earned $ 11,055 100.0 $ 10,101 100.0 $ 8,915 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 7,749 70.1 7,128 70.6 6,360 71.3 Underwriting expenses 1,992 18.0 1,752 17.3 1,585 17.8 Total losses and expenses 9,741 88.1 8,880 87.9 7,945 89.1 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 1,314 $ 1,221 * $ 970 * Net of losses of $200 million from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Premiums earned in 2006 and 2005 increased 9.4% and 13.3%, respectively, over the corresponding prior year amounts. The growth in premiums earned in 2006 for voluntary auto was 9.3% and reflects a 10.7% increase in policies-in-force during the past year. During 2006, policies-in-force increased 11.3% in the preferred risk markets and 8.6% in the standard and nonstandard markets. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2006 increased 8.8% compared to 2005. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2006 were 721,000 higher than at December 31, 2005. Premium rates have been reduced and underwriting guidelines have been adjusted in certain markets to better match price with the underlying risk resulting in relatively lower premiums per policy. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2006 were $7,749 million, an increase of 8.7% over 2005. The loss ratio declined to 70.1% in 2006 compared to 70.6% in 2005 and 71.3% in 2004 primarily due to decreasing claim frequencies across all markets and most coverage types. In 2006, claims frequencies for physical damage coverages decreased in the two to five percent range from 2005 while frequencies for injury coverages decreased in the two to five percent range. Injury severity in 2006 increased in the two to five percent range over 2005 while physical damage severity increased in the four to seven percent range. Incurred losses from catastrophe events were approximately $54 million in 2006, $227 million in 2005 (primarily from the hurricanes in the third and fourth quarters) and $71 million in 2004. Underwriting expenses in 2006 were $1,992 million, an increase of 13.7% over 2005, which increased 10.5% over 2004. The increase in expenses in 2006 reflected higher advertising costs as well as incremental underwriting and policy issuance costs associated with new business sales. General Re General Re conducts a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. In North America, property and casualty reinsurance is written on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation. Internationally, property and casualty reinsurance is written on a direct basis through 95% owned Cologne Re (based in Germany) and other wholly-owned affiliates as well as through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written for clients worldwide through Cologne Re. General Re’s pre-tax underwriting results are summarized for the past three years in the following table. Amounts are in millions. Pre-tax underwriting Premiums written Premiums earned gain (loss) 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Property/casualty: North American $ 1,731 $ 1,988 $ 2,747 $ 1,799 $ 2,201 $ 3,012 $ 127 $ (307 ) $ 11 International 1,850 1,864 2,091 1,912 1,939 2,218 246 (138 ) (93 ) Life/health 2,368 2,303 2,022 2,364 2,295 2,015 153 111 85 $ 5,949 $ 6,155 $ 6,860 $ 6,075 $ 6,435 $ 7,245 $ 526 $ (334) * $ 3 * Includes losses of $685 million related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. 30 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) Property/casualty Premiums written declined in 2006 from amounts written in 2005 which declined from amounts written in 2004. The declines in North America were attributable to significant reductions in finite risk business and to a lesser extent lower casualty treaty volume. International premiums written in 2006 were essentially unchanged from 2005. In local currencies, international premiums written increased 2% over 2005 primarily due to increased volume of property business at Faraday offset by a significant reduction in finite risk business. The overall comparative declines in written premiums in the past three years reflected continued underwriting discipline by rejecting transactions where pricing is deemed inadequate with respect to the risk. Approximately half of the comparative declines in the North American premiums earned in 2006 and 2005 versus the previous year were attributable to policy cancellations and non-renewals exceeding new contracts as well as a slight impact from rate changes. The remainder of the comparative declines were primarily due to the significant decreases in finite risk business. In local currencies, 2006 international premiums earned declined 3.5% from 2005, which declined 12.3% compared with 2004. Similar to North America, the decline in premiums earned in the international segment over the past three years generally reflects reductions in premium volume due to the non-renewal of unprofitable business and the decrease in finite risk business. The North American business produced an underwriting gain of $127 million in 2006 compared with an underwriting loss of $307 million in 2005 and an underwriting gain of $11 million in 2004. Underwriting results in 2006 included $348 million in underwriting gains from property business partially offset by $221 million in underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business and includes legal and estimated settlement costs associated with the ongoing regulatory investigations of the finite risk business. The property business produced underwriting gains of $209 million for the 2006 accident year, and $139 million from favorable run-off of prior year property losses. The current accident year results benefited from a lack of catastrophe losses. The underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business in 2006 included (1) $137 million in discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, (2) increases in prior years’ workers’ compensation reserves of $103 million arising from the continuing escalation of medical utilization and cost inflation and (3) increases in asbestos and environmental reserves of $58 million. These losses were somewhat offset by net decreases in prior years’ reserves for other casualty coverages. The 2005 underwriting loss included approximately $480 million in losses from three major hurricanes in 2005 (Katrina, Rita and Wilma). Otherwise, underwriting results for the 2005 accident year generally benefited from re-pricing efforts and improved coverage terms and conditions put into place over the preceding few years. Underwriting results in 2005 also included losses attributable to prior accident years’ consisting of net reserve increases on workers’ compensation of $228 million, asbestos and environmental mass tort exposures of $102 million and $136 million in discount accretion on workers’ compensation reserves and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance coverages. Offsetting these prior years’ losses were $419 million in gains from net reserve decreases in other casualty lines and property lines. The net underwriting gain of $11 million in 2004 consisted of current accident year gains of $166 million partially offset by $155 million in prior accident years’ losses. The 2004 current accident year results benefited from a one-time reduction of $70 million in underwriting expenses from the curtailment of certain pension benefits. In 2004, prior accident years’ losses included reserve increases on casualty and workers’ compensation claims of $729 million and $110 million in discount accretion and deferred charge amortization offset by $307 million of reserve reductions for prior years’ property losses (primarily in World Trade Center loss exposures) and $377 million of gains from contract commutations and settlements. The International property/casualty businesses produced an underwriting gain of $246 million in 2006 compared with underwriting losses of $138 million and $93 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Underwriting results for 2006 benefited from $360 million of net gains in property and aviation lines of business and the lack of catastrophe losses. Partially offsetting these gains were $114 million in net losses in casualty business, including costs associated with the finite risk business regulatory investigations. Underwriting results for both 2005 and 2004 included catastrophe losses from the U.S. hurricanes of $205 million and $110 million, respectively. Additionally, 2005 results included $29 million in losses from windstorm Erwin. Underwriting results for each of the last three years benefited from favorable results of the aviation and non-catastrophe property businesses. The International property and casualty underwriting results included gains associated with prior accident years of $235 million in 2006 compared with gains of $108 million in 2005 and losses of $102 million in 2004. Prior years’ losses in 2004 were primarily in motor excess, workers’ compensation and other casualty lines and increases for operations placed in run-off. Life/health Premiums earned in 2006 increased 3.0% over 2005, which increased 13.9% over 2004. Adjusting for the effects of foreign currency, premiums earned increased 2.3% in 2006 and 14.2% in 2005. The increase in premiums earned in 2006 was primarily from European life business and in 2005 was primarily due to an increase in both North American and European life business. The global life/health operations produced underwriting gains of $153 million in 2006, $111 million in 2005 and $85 million in 2004. Both the U.S. and international life/health operations were profitable in each of the past three years primarily due to favorable mortality; however, most of the gains were earned in the international life business. Additionally, included in the underwriting results for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $31 million, $66 million and $46 million, respectively, of net losses attributable to reserve increases on certain U.S. health business in run-off. 31 Table of Contents Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) underwrites excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota share coverages for insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG’s business includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and excess direct and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual discrete property risks referred to as individual risk. Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Other multi-line refers to other business written on both a quota-share and excess basis, participations in and contracts with Lloyd’s syndicates, as well as aviation business and workers’ compensation programs. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce extraordinary volatility in the periodic underwriting results of the BHRG, and, in particular, in the catastrophe and individual risk business. The pre-tax probable maximum loss from a single event is currently estimated to be approximately $6 billion. BHRG’s pre-tax underwriting results are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Catastrophe and individual risk $ 2,196 $ 1,663 $ 1,462 $ 1,588 $ (1,178 ) $ 385 Retroactive reinsurance 146 10 188 (173 ) (214 ) (412 ) Other multi-line 2,634 2,290 2,064 243 323 444 $ 4,976 $ 3,963 $ 3,714 $ 1,658 $ (1,069) * $ 417 * Includes losses of $2.5 billion from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Catastrophe and individual risk contracts may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification, often several hundred million dollars and occasionally in excess of $1 billion, and cover catastrophe risks (such as hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters) or other property risks (such as aviation and aerospace, commercial multi-peril or terrorism). Catastrophe and individual risk premiums written were approximately $2.4 billion in 2006, $1.8 billion in 2005 and $1.5 billion in 2004. The increase in volume in 2006 was principally attributable to improved rates in the U.S. and limited industry capacity for catastrophe reinsurance which led to more opportunities to write new business. The level of business written in future periods may vary significantly based upon market conditions and management’s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. Pre-tax underwriting results in 2006 reflect no significant losses from catastrophe events and incurred losses of approximately $200 million attributable to prior years’ events, primarily Hurricane Wilma which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. Underwriting results from catastrophe and individual risk business in 2005 included estimated losses of approximately $2.4 billion from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. In 2004, underwriting results from catastrophe and individual risk business included estimated catastrophe losses of $790 million from four hurricanes that struck the U.S. and Caribbean during the third quarter. The timing and magnitude of losses produce extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results of BHRG’s catastrophe and individual risk business. BHRG generally does not cede catastrophe and individual risks to mitigate the volatility. Management accepts such potential volatility provided that the long-term prospect of achieving underwriting profits is reasonable. Retroactive policies normally provide very large, but limited, indemnification of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events that are expected to be paid over long periods of time. The underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance are primarily attributed to the amortization of deferred charges established on retroactive reinsurance contracts written in previous years. The deferred charges, which represent the difference between the premium and the estimated ultimate claim reserves, are amortized over the expected claim payment period using the interest method. The amortization charges are recorded as losses incurred and, therefore, generate underwriting losses. The level of amortization in a given period is based upon estimates of the timing and amount of future loss payments. To the extent there are changes in these estimates, deferred charge balances are adjusted on a retrospective basis via a cumulative adjustment. Underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance in 2006 are net of gains of approximately $145 million which primarily derived from contracts that were commuted or amended during the last half of 2006. Underwriting losses in 2005 from retroactive reinsurance are net of a gain of approximately $46 million related to the final settlement of remaining unpaid losses under a retroactive reinsurance agreement. In addition, estimates of unpaid losses were reviewed during the fourth quarter of 2005 which resulted in a net reduction of $75 million in loss reserves and the rates of deferred charge amortization on certain other contracts were decreased due to slower than expected loss payments. During 2004 the estimated timing of future loss payments with respect to one large contract was accelerated which produced an incremental amortization charge of approximately $100 million. Unamortized deferred charges at December 31, 2006 were approximately $1.74 billion compared to $2.13 billion at December 31, 2005. Management believes that these charges are reasonable with respect to the large amounts of float related to these policies. Float was approximately $6.5 billion at December 31, 2006. Premiums earned from other multi-line reinsurance increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the continued growth in workers’ compensation programs. Increased premiums were earned in 2005 as compared to 2004 from new workers’ compensation and ongoing aviation programs and were partially offset by declines in quota-share contracts. Underwriting results from other multi-line reinsurance in 2006 reflected favorable comparative underwriting results from property contracts which benefited from low catastrophe losses. These favorable comparative results were somewhat offset by a deterioration in underwriting results from aviation business. Underwriting results in 2005 included estimated losses of approximately $100 million from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, while results in 2004 included losses of approximately $175 million arising from the third quarter hurricanes affecting the U.S. and Caribbean. However, underwriting gains from aviation coverages and approximately $160 million in gains from the commutations of several reinsurance contracts during 2004 more than offset the losses arising from catastrophes. 32 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) In November 2006, BHRG and Equitas, a London based entity established to reinsure and manage the 1992 and prior years’ non-life liabilities of the Names or Underwriters at Lloyd’s of London, entered into an agreement for BHRG to provide potentially up to $7 billion of new excess reinsurance to Equitas. BHRG will also employ the current staff of Equitas and manage the run-off of Equitas’ liabilities. The agreement is subject to the approval by certain regulatory authorities in the United States and the United Kingdom as well as various other conditions which must be obtained by March 31, 2007. Consideration payable to BHRG under the arrangement would initially consist of all of Equitas’ assets less 100 million Pounds Sterling. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group Berkshire’s primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of smaller insurance businesses that principally write liability coverages for commercial accounts. These businesses include: National Indemnity Company’s primary group operation (“NICO Primary Group”), a writer of motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation (“USIC”), whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as “Homestate” operations, providers of standard multi-line insurance; Central States Indemnity Company (“CSI”), a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions; and MedPro and Applied Underwriters, which as previously noted were acquired in June 2005 and May 2006, respectively. Collectively, Berkshire’s primary insurance businesses produced earned premiums of $1,858 million in 2006, $1,498 million in 2005 and $1,211 million in 2004. The increase in premiums earned in 2006 was primarily attributable to the impact of the MedPro and Applied Underwriters acquisitions partially offset by a decline in volume of the NICO Primary Group. Premiums earned in the last half of 2005 by MedPro accounted for most of the increase in total premiums earned by the primary group in 2005 compared with 2004. Pre-tax underwriting gains as percentages of premiums earned were approximately 18% in 2006, 16% in 2005 and 13% in 2004. Underwriting gains in 2006 were achieved in all of the businesses. The underwriting gain in 2005 reflected a decrease in loss reserve estimates for pre-2005 loss events in the NICO Primary Group business, improved results of Homestate, USIC and CSI operations partially offset by losses incurred from increases in medical malpractice reserves. Insurance — Investment Income Following is a summary of the net investment income of Berkshire’s insurance operations for the past three years. Amounts are in millions. 2006 2005 2004 Investment income before taxes $ 4,316 $ 3,480 $ 2,824 Income taxes and minority interests 1,196 1,068 779 Investment income after taxes and minority interests $ 3,120 $ 2,412 $ 2,045 Investment income consists of interest and dividends earned on cash equivalents and fixed maturity and equity investments of Berkshire’s insurance businesses. Pre-tax investment income earned in 2006 by Berkshire’s insurance businesses increased $836 million (24%) over 2005, which increased $656 million (23%) over 2004. The increase in 2006 reflects higher short-term interest rates in the United States and increased dividends as compared to 2005. The increase in investment income in 2005 primarily reflects higher short-term interest rates in the United States as compared to 2004. A summary of investments held in Berkshire’s insurance businesses follows. Amounts are in millions.

Dollar amounts are in millions. Unrealized Amortized cost gains/losses Fair value U.S. Treasury, government corporations and agencies $ 4,941 $ (2 ) $ 4,939 States, municipalities and political subdivisions 2,967 56 3,023 Foreign governments 8,444 (28 ) 8,416 Corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, investment grade 3,610 150 3,760 Corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, non-investment grade 1,858 1,300 3,158 Mortgage-backed securities 1,948 28 1,976 $ 23,768 $ 1,504 $ 25,272 All U.S. government obligations are rated AAA by the major rating agencies and 96% of all state, municipal and political subdivisions, foreign government obligations and mortgage-backed securities were rated AA or higher. Non-investment grade securities represent securities that are rated below BBB- or Baa3. Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities assumed under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $50.9 billion at December 31, 2006, $49.3 billion at December 31, 2005 and $46.1 billion at December 31, 2004. The cost of float, as represented by the ratio of pre-tax underwriting gain or loss to average float, was negative for the last three years, as Berkshire’s insurance businesses generated pre-tax underwriting gains in each year. Utilities and energy (“MidAmerican”) Revenues and earnings from MidAmerican for each of the past three years are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 MidAmerican Energy Company $ 3,519 $ 3,200 $ 2,731 $ 348 $ 288 $ 268 PacifiCorp 2,971 — — 356 — — Natural gas pipelines 972 909 884 376 309 289 U.K. utilities 961 921 955 338 308 326 Real estate brokerage 1,724 1,894 1,777 74 148 130 Other 497 356 380 226 115 (406 ) $ 10,644 $ 7,280 $ 6,727 Earnings before corporate interest and taxes 1,718 1,168 607 Interest, other than to Berkshire (261 ) (200 ) (212 ) Interest on Berkshire junior debt (134 ) (157 ) (170 ) Income tax (407 ) (248 ) (55 ) Net earnings $ 916 $ 563 $ 170 Earnings applicable to Berkshire * $ 885 $ 523 * $ 237 * Debt owed to others 16,946 10,296 10,528 Debt owed to Berkshire 1,055 1,289 1,478 * Net of minority interests and includes interest earned by Berkshire (net of related income taxes). Also includes additional income tax charges of $49 million and $15 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to Berkshire’s accounting for MidAmerican under the equity method. Berkshire’s 2005 and 2004 Consolidated Financial Statements reflect Berkshire’s share of MidAmerican’s net earnings as determined under the equity method. In 2006, MidAmerican’s revenues and expenses are consolidated in Berkshire’s financial statements. For comparative purposes, revenues and earnings of MidAmerican for 2005 and 2004 are provided in the table above. Revenues and earnings of the utilities and energy businesses are, to some extent, seasonal depending on weather-induced demand. Revenues from U.S. electricity sales are generally higher in the summer when air conditioning use is greatest and revenues from gas sales and pipelines are generally higher in the winter when heating needs are higher. Real estate brokerage revenues tend to be highest in the second and third quarters. MidAmerican’s revenues of $10,644 million in 2006 increased $3,364 million (46%) and earnings before corporate interest and taxes (“EBIT”) of $1,718 million in 2006 increased $550 million (47%) as compared to 2005. The increases in revenues and EBIT were largely attributable to the acquisition of PacifiCorp on March 21, 2006. Revenues of MidAmerican 34 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) (Continued) Energy Company (“MEC”) of $3,519 million increased $319 million (10%) as compared to 2005. Major factors giving rise to MEC’s revenue increase were a change in strategy related to certain end use natural gas contracts that resulted in revenues and costs being recorded on a gross rather than net basis and higher wholesale electricity sales due to both price and volume increases. Somewhat offsetting these increases were lower natural gas sales due to mild temperatures in 2006. EBIT of MEC increased $60 million (21%) as compared to 2005. About 2/3 of the increase was due to improved margins on regulated electricity sales. Revenues from natural gas pipelines of $972 million in 2006 increased $63 million (7%) and EBIT of $376 million in 2006 increased $67 million (22%) as compared to 2005. The comparative improvement in revenues and EBIT was primarily due to favorable market conditions resulting in higher demand and rates as well as additional transportation and storage services. EBIT of the U.K. utilities business of $338 million in 2006 increased $30 million (10%) as compared to 2005. The increase was due to an increase in regulated revenues as well as a favorable impact from the strengthening of the Pound Sterling versus the U.S. dollar. Revenues from the real estate brokerage business of $1,724 million in 2006 decreased $170 million (9%) and EBIT of $74 million in 2006 decreased $74 million (50%) as compared to 2005. The declines were due to a significant reduction in the number of closed transactions due to the significant slowdown in U.S. residential real estate activity. EBIT from other activities of $226 million in 2006 increased $111 million as compared to 2005. Most of this increase arose from a gain on the sale of a security that was received in connection with a bankruptcy claim award as well as from sales of other investments. In 2004, EBIT includes an impairment charge of $579 million related to the discontinuance of the operations of MidAmerican’s mineral extraction facility. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A comparison of revenues and pre-tax earnings between 2006, 2005 and 2004 for the manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 McLane Company $ 25,693 $ 24,074 $ 23,373 $ 229 $ 217 $ 228 Shaw Industries 5,834 5,723 5,174 594 485 466 Other manufacturing 11,988 9,260 8,152 1,756 1,335 1,160 Other service * 5,811 4,728 4,507 658 329 412 Retailing 3,334 3,111 2,936 289 257 215 $ 52,660 $ 46,896 $ 44,142 Pre-tax earnings $ 3,526 $ 2,623 $ 2,481 Income taxes and minority interests 1,395 977 941 $ 2,131 $ 1,646 $ 1,540 * In 2004, Berkshire adopted the provisions of EITF 00-21 (“Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables”). As a result, for consolidated reporting purposes, the method of recognizing revenue related to NetJets’ fractional aircraft sales was changed. Management continues to evaluate the results of NetJets under the prior revenue recognition criteria and thus has shown revenues and pre-tax earnings for the other services businesses using the prior revenue recognition method. Revenues shown in this table are greater than the amounts reported in Berkshire’s consolidated financial statements by $781 million in 2006, $704 million in 2005 and $902 million in 2004. Pre-tax earnings included in this table for 2006, 2005 and 2004 exceed the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements by $79 million, $63 million and $74 million, respectively. McLane Company McLane Company, Inc., (“McLane”) is a distributor of grocery and food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. McLane’s business is marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins. McLane’s revenues in 2006 increased $1,619 million (7%) as compared to 2005, which increased $701 million (3%) as compared to 2004. The comparative revenue increases in both 2006 and 2005 were due to increased grocery business partially offset by comparative reductions in restaurant food service revenues primarily due to the loss of a large customer in mid-2005. Pre-tax earnings in 2006 increased $12 million over 2005 which reflects the increase in sales volume. Pre-tax earnings in 2006 were negatively affected by a comparative 0.13% reduction in gross margin percentage which was primarily attributable to increased competition in the grocery business. The impact from the decline in gross margin in 2006 was largely offset by comparatively lower operating expenses that were primarily attributable to lower insurance costs. About 1/3 of McLane’s annual revenues are to Wal-Mart. A curtailment of purchasing by Wal-Mart could have a material adverse impact on revenues and pre-tax earnings of McLane. Shaw Industries Shaw Industries (“Shaw”) is the world’s largest manufacturer of tufted broadloom carpets and is a full-service flooring company. Shaw’s revenues of $5,834 million in 2006 increased $111 million (2%) and pre-tax earnings of $594 million in 2006 increased $109 million (22%) as compared to 2005. The increase in revenues reflected a 7% increase in average selling price for carpet, partially offset by a 6% reduction in square yards sold. The comparative decline in 2006 square yards sold versus 2005 accelerated during the third and fourth quarters, which is attributed to a slowing of single-family housing construction and the acceleration of customer purchases during the second half of 2005 in anticipation of price increases. The increase in pre-tax earnings was primarily generated in the first six months of the year and was mainly attributable to a reduction in manufacturing 35 Table of Contents Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Shaw Industries (Continued) cost per unit deriving from the integration of carpet backing and nylon-fiber manufacturing operations acquired by Shaw in the fourth quarter of 2005. These two acquisitions allow Shaw to internally produce most of its carpet backing needs and to secure a more stable raw material source. As a result of the continued slowdown in housing construction activity, the decline in volume is expected to continue at least during the first half of 2007. Revenues of $5,723 million in 2005 increased $549 million (11%) and pre-tax earnings of $485 million in 2005 increased $19 million (4%) as compared to 2004. Despite increases in selling prices, operating margins in 2005 were adversely affected by repeated increases in petroleum-based raw material costs. Consequently, increases in production costs outpaced increases in selling prices. In addition, product sample costs pertaining to the introduction of new products increased approximately $29 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. Other manufacturing Berkshire’s other manufacturing businesses include a wide array of businesses. Included in this group are several manufacturers of building products (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville and MiTek) and apparel (Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Russell Corporation, Fechheimers, Justin Brands and the H.H. Brown Shoe Group). Also included in this group are Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehicles that was acquired on August 31, 2005 and the Iscar Metalworking Companies (“IMC”), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide that was acquired on July 5, 2006. Additionally, there are numerous other manufacturers of consumer and commercial products in this diverse group. Revenues from this group of manufacturing businesses of $11,988 million in 2006 increased $2,728 million (29%) and pre-tax earnings of $1,756 million in 2006 increased $421 million (32%) as compared to 2005. The acquisitions of Forest River in August 2005, IMC in July 2006 and Russell Corporation in August 2006 account for a substantial portion of these increases. Revenues from other manufacturing businesses of $9,260 million in 2005 increased $1,108 million (14%) and pre-tax earnings increased $175 million (15%) as compared to 2004. The aforementioned acquisition of Forest River accounted for a significant portion of the increase. Additionally, the building products group of businesses reported significant increases in revenues and pre-tax earnings in both 2006 and 2005 as compared to the prior year. However, due to the continued slowdown in housing construction activity in the United States, earnings of the building products businesses are expected to be negatively impacted in 2007 as compared to 2006. Other service Berkshire’s other service businesses include NetJets, the world’s leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft and ships. Among other businesses included in this group are Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools; International Dairy Queen, a licensor and service provider to about 6,000 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; the Buffalo News, a publisher of a daily and Sunday newspaper; and Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings. Revenues from the service businesses of $5,811 million in 2006 increased $1,083 million (23%) and pre-tax earnings of $658 million in 2006 increased $329 million (100%) as compared to 2005. The largest portion of these increases arose from greatly improved comparative operating results at NetJets where revenues increased $759 million over 2005. NetJets generated pre-tax earnings of $143 million in 2006 as compared to a pre-tax loss of $80 million in 2005 reflecting a 23% increase in flight operations and management service revenues and increased fractional aircraft sales. In 2006, occupied flight hours increased 19% and average hourly rates increased as well. The number of aircraft managed within the NetJets program over the past twelve months increased 13%. The improvement in operating results at NetJets also reflected a substantial decline in subcontracted flights that are necessary to meet peak customer demand, which resulted in a $77 million improvement in pre-tax earnings. Comparative results in 2006 also benefited from the inclusion of Business Wire which was acquired in February 2006 as well as comparative increases in revenues and earnings for FlightSafety. Revenues from other service businesses of $4,728 million in 2005 increased $221 million (5%) and pre-tax earnings of $329 million in 2005 declined $83 million (20%) as compared to 2004. NetJets incurred a pre-tax loss of about $80 million in 2005 compared to pre-tax earnings of about $10 million in 2004. Several factors contributed to the loss in 2005. Throughout 2005, NetJets experienced unusually high shortages of available aircraft due to increases in owner demand outpacing increases in capacity. Consequently, NetJets subcontracted additional aircraft capacity through charter services. The costs associated with subcontracted flights were not fully recoverable from clients and caused an incremental cost of approximately $85 million in 2005. NetJets has added aircraft to the core fleet and has developed strategies to address capacity issues and restore profitability as the results in 2006 reflect. NetJets also recorded a special charge of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 for prior periods’ compensation related to a new labor contract with its pilots and flight attendants. Retailing Berkshire’s retailing operations consist of several home furnishings (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s) and jewelry (Borsheim’s, Helzbergs and Ben Bridge) retailers. Also included in this group is See’s Candies. Revenues from this group of businesses of $3,334 million in 2006 increased $223 million (7%) and pre-tax earnings of $289 million increased $32 million (12%) as compared to 2005. Revenues of the home furnishings businesses were $2,144 million in 2006 and $1,958 million in 2005 and jewelry revenues were $815 million in 2006 and $801 million in 2005. Home furnishings revenues in 2006 included sales from two new R.C. Willey stores of $77 million. In addition, same store home furnishings sales in 2006 increased approximately 6% compared to 2005. A significant portion of the increase in pre-tax earnings was due to See’s Candies which reported an increase of approximately $27 million. 36 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) Revenues from the retailing group of $3,111 million in 2005 increased $175 million (6%) and pre-tax earnings of $257 million in 2005 increased $42 million (20%) in 2005 as compared to 2004. Same store sales as well as new stores opened at R.C. Willey and Jordan’s and increased earnings at See’s contributed to these favorable comparative results. Finance and Financial Products A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings from Berkshire’s finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Manufactured housing and finance $ 3,570 $ 3,175 $ 2,024 $ 513 $ 416 $ 192 Furniture/transportation equipment leasing 880 856 789 182 173 92 Other 674 528 961 462 233 300 $ 5,124 $ 4,559 $ 3,774 Pre-tax earnings 1,157 822 584 Income taxes and minority interests 425 308 211 $ 732 $ 514 $ 373 Revenues and pre-tax earnings from manufactured housing and finance activities (Clayton Homes) increased 12% and 23%, respectively, as compared to 2005. In 2006, manufactured home sales increased $302 million as compared to 2005 which was primarily due to slightly increased sales of higher priced homes and an increase in total units sold. However, unit sales during the second half of 2006 declined as compared to 2005. Interest income from installment loans in 2006 increased $104 million as compared to 2005 due to higher average installment loan balances primarily from loan portfolio acquisitions during 2005. The balance of installment loans has stabilized after significant increases in recent years. Absent major new loan portfolio acquisitions or significant increases in loan originations, installment loan balances are expected to gradually decline as loan portfolios acquired in 2004 and 2005 are repaid. Consequently, the rate of growth in interest income may decline over the next year and amounts may eventually decline in comparison with amounts earned in 2006. The increase in revenues in 2005 as compared to 2004 from Clayton Homes was primarily attributable to increased sales of manufactured homes of $491 million and increased interest income of $583 million from higher installment loan balances. Installment loan balances at the end of 2005 increased approximately $8.5 billion since Berkshire’s acquisition of Clayton Homes in 2003, reflecting the impact of several loan portfolio acquisitions as well as loan originations. Pre-tax earnings from Clayton Homes of $416 million in 2005, increased $224 million (117%) as compared to 2004. The significant increase in pre-tax earnings was primarily due to higher interest income from the loan portfolios acquired during 2004 and 2005, partially offset by higher interest expenses. Pre-tax earnings from other finance activities of $462 million, increased $229 million as compared to 2005. Other finance activities include the General Re derivatives business, which has completed a major portion of its run-off, and Berkshire’s earnings from its investment in Value Capital, a partnership that was substantially liquidated as of June 30, 2006. These two activities generated breakeven results in 2006 compared to pre-tax losses of $137 million in 2005. Other pre-tax earnings for 2006 also include a fee of $67 million in connection with an Equity Commitment Agreement that Berkshire entered into with USG Corporation (“USG”). Under the Equity Commitment Agreement, Berkshire agreed to purchase no less than 6.5 million and up to 44.9 million additional shares of USG common stock to facilitate an equity rights offering. Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses follows. Amounts are in millions. 2006 2005 2004 Investment gains/losses from - Sales and other disposals of investments - Insurance and other $ 1,782 $ 5,831 $ 1,527 Finance and financial products 6 544 61 Other-than-temporary impairments (142 ) (114 ) (19 ) Life settlement contracts 92 (82 ) (207 ) Other 73 17 267 1,811 6,196 1,629 Derivative gains/losses from - Foreign currency forward contracts 186 (955 ) 1,839 Other 638 253 21 824 (702 ) 1,860 Gains/losses before income taxes and minority interests 2,635 5,494 3,489 Income taxes and minority interests 926 1,964 1,230 Net gains/losses $ 1,709 $ 3,530 $ 2,259 37 Table of Contents Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) Investment gains or losses are recognized upon the sales of investments or as otherwise required under GAAP. The timing of realized gains or losses from sales can have a material effect on periodic earnings. However, such gains or losses usually have little, if any, impact on total shareholders’ equity because most equity and fixed maturity investments are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gain or loss included as a component of other comprehensive income. Other-than-temporary impairment losses represent the adjustment of cost to fair value when, as required by GAAP, management concludes that an investment’s decline in value below cost is other than temporary. The impairment loss represents a non-cash charge to earnings. For many years, Berkshire held an investment in common stock of The Gillette Company (“Gillette”). On October 1, 2005, The Procter & Gamble Company (“PG”) completed its acquisition of Gillette and issued 0.975 shares of its common stock for each outstanding share of Gillette common stock. Berkshire recognized a non-cash pre-tax investment gain of approximately $5 billion upon the exchange of the Gillette shares for PG shares. Berkshire’s management does not regard the gain that was recorded, as required by GAAP, as meaningful. Berkshire intends to hold the shares of PG just as it held the Gillette shares. The gain recognized for financial reporting purposes is deferred for income tax purposes. The transaction essentially had no effect on Berkshire’s consolidated shareholders’ equity because the gain included in earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 was accompanied by a corresponding reduction of unrealized investment gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income. In 2004 and 2005, life settlement investments were carried at the cash surrender value pursuant to FASB Technical Bulletin (“FTB”) 85-4 “Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance.” The excess of the cash paid to purchase these contracts over the cash surrender value at the date of purchase was recognized as a loss immediately and periodic maintenance costs, such as premiums necessary to keep the underlying policies in force, were charged to earnings. Effective January 1, 2006, Berkshire adopted the new accounting pronouncement FTB 85-4-1 and elected to use the investment method, whereby the aforementioned costs were capitalized. The cumulative effect of the accounting change which increased the carrying value of the contracts owned as of the adoption date was recorded, net of applicable income tax, as an increase to retained earnings of $180 million. In 2006, Berkshire disposed of most of the life settlement contracts. The excess of the proceeds over the carrying value of the contracts disposed of represents most of the gain from these contracts in 2006. Derivative gains and losses from foreign currency forward contracts arise as the value of the U.S. dollar changes against certain foreign currencies. Small changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates produce material changes in the fair value of these contracts and consequently can produce volatility in reported earnings. The notional values of open foreign currency forward contracts were approximately $1 billion and $14 billion as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During 2005, the value of most foreign currencies decreased relative to the U.S. dollar and these contracts produced losses. Conversely, the value of many foreign currencies rose relative to the U.S. dollar in 2004, and Berkshire’s contract positions produced significant gains. Over the past three years, Berkshire has also entered into several other derivative contracts pertaining to credit default risks of other entities as well as equity price risk associated with major equity indices. Such contracts are carried at estimated fair value and the change in estimated fair value is included in earnings in the period of the change. Other derivative contract gains in 2006 derived primarily from credit default contracts. Management attributes the gains to tightening of interest rate spreads and market perceptions that the creditworthiness of many of the underlying credit issuers has improved. Financial Condition Berkshire’s balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2006 was $108.4 billion. Consolidated cash and invested assets, excluding assets of finance and financial products businesses, was approximately $126.1 billion at December 31, 2006 (including cash and cash equivalents of $38.3 billion) and $115.6 billion at December 31, 2005 (including cash and cash equivalents of $40.5 billion). Berkshire’s invested assets are held predominantly in its insurance businesses. Berkshire believes that it currently maintains sufficient liquidity to cover its contractual obligations and provide for contingent liquidity. During 2006, Berkshire made several business acquisitions for aggregate cash consideration of $10.1 billion. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information concerning these acquisitions. Berkshire maintains a large amount of capital in its insurance subsidiaries for strategic purposes and in support of reserves for unpaid losses. In the United States, in particular, dividend payments by insurance companies are subject to prior approval by state regulators. For the year ending December 31, 2006, Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries paid dividends of $7.1 billion. Capital expenditures of the utilities and energy businesses were $2.4 billion in 2006. Capital expenditures, construction and other development costs for the year ending December 31, 2007 are forcasted to be approximately $3.0 billion. MidAmerican expects to fund these capital expenditures with cash flows from operations and the issuance of debt. MidAmerican utilizes debt to finance the construction of long-lived regulated electric and gas utility assets, including power plants, transmission and distribution assets and natural gas pipelines and may also issue debt to finance operations. Certain borrowings of its regulated utility subsidiaries are secured by the assets of those subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2006, outstanding debt of MidAmerican maturing in 2007 and 2008 was $3.6 billion, with an additional $1.7 billion due before 2012. During 2006, Berkshire made a five year commitment to provide up to $3.5 billion of additional capital to MidAmerican to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund its regulated utility subsidiaries. Berkshire has not and does not intend to guarantee the repayment of debt by MidAmerican or any of its subsidiaries. 38 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) Berkshire’s consolidated notes payable and other borrowings of insurance and other businesses, was $3.7 billion at December 31, 2006 and $3.6 billion at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2006, outstanding borrowings include parent company borrowings of $612 million that mature in 2007, including senior notes issued as part of the SQUARZ securities in 2002. The outstanding SQUARZ securities consist of $334 million principal amount of senior notes due in November 2007 and outstanding warrants that expire in May 2007 to purchase 3,716 Class A equivalent shares of Berkshire common stock. A warrant premium is payable to Berkshire at an annual rate of 3.75% and interest is payable to note holders at a rate of 3.00%. Each warrant provides the holder the right to purchase either 0.1116 shares of Class A or 3.348 shares of Class B stock for $10,000. Short-term borrowings consist primarily of commercial paper and bank loans of NetJets, which are used in the ordinary course of business. The full and timely payment of such borrowings is guaranteed by Berkshire. Assets of the finance and financial products businesses were $24.6 billion as of December 31, 2006 and $24.5 billion as of December 31, 2005, consisting primarily of loans and finance receivables, fixed maturity securities and cash and cash equivalents. Liabilities were $19.4 billion as of December 31, 2006 and $20.3 billion as of December 31, 2005 and include notes and other borrowings of $12.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and $10.9 billion at December 31, 2005. Notes payable include $8.85 billion par amount of medium-term notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). The notes mature at various dates beginning in 2007 ($700 million) through 2015. The proceeds from these notes were used to finance originated and acquired loans of Clayton Homes. Full and timely payment of principal and interest on the notes issued by BHFC is guaranteed by Berkshire. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2006, Clayton Homes borrowed $1.3 billion under non-public pass-through arrangements having an expected weighted average life of approximately eight years. Such borrowings are secured by portfolios of manufactured housing loans and are not guaranteed by Berkshire. The proceeds from these borrowings will be used to repay certain debt of BHFC. Contractual Obligations Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Notes payable are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements along with accrued but unpaid interest as of the balance sheet date. In addition, Berkshire is obligated to pay interest under debt obligations for periods subsequent to the balance sheet date. Although certain principal balances may be prepaid in advance of the maturity date, thus reducing future interest obligations, it is assumed that no principal prepayments will occur for purposes of this disclosure. Further, while short-term borrowings and repurchase agreements are currently expected to be renewed as they mature, such amounts are not assumed to renew for purposes of this disclosure. Berkshire and subsidiaries are also parties to long-term contracts to acquire goods or services in the future, which are not currently reflected in the financial statements. Such obligations, including future minimum rentals under operating leases, will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date. Contractual obligations for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are estimates. The timing and amount of such payments are contingent upon the ultimate outcome of claim settlements that will occur over many years. The amounts presented in the following table have been estimated based upon past claim settlement activities. The timing and amount of such payments are subject to significant estimation error. The factors affecting the ultimate amount of claims are discussed in the following section regarding Berkshire’s critical accounting policies. Accordingly, the actual timing and amount of payments may differ materially from the amounts shown in the table. A summary of long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 follows. Amounts represent estimates of gross undiscounted amounts payable over time. In addition, certain losses and loss adjustment expenses for property and casualty loss reserves are ceded to others under reinsurance contracts and therefore are recoverable. Such recoverables are not reflected in the table. Amounts are in millions.

Amounts recognized in the financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on numerous assumptions involving varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, the amounts currently reflected in the financial statements will likely increase or decrease in the future as additional information becomes available. Property and casualty losses A summary of Berkshire’s consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Except for certain workers’ compensation reserves, liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as “gross unpaid losses”) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value, regardless of the length of the claim-tail. Amounts are in millions. Gross unpaid losses Net unpaid losses* Dec. 31, 2006 Dec. 31, 2005 Dec. 31, 2006 Dec. 31, 2005 GEICO $ 6,095 $ 5,578 $ 5,814 $ 5,285 General Re 20,444 21,524 18,361 20,429 BHRG 16,832 17,202 14,255 14,577 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 4,241 3,730 3,741 3,271 Total $ 47,612 $ 48,034 $ 42,171 $ 43,562 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges reinsurance assumed and before foreign currency translation effects. Berkshire records liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts with respect to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. Depending on the type of loss being estimated, the timing and amount of loss payments are subject to a great degree of variability and are contingent, among other things, upon the timing of the claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the determination and payment of the ultimate loss amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used to establish and review the liabilities for unpaid losses recorded as of the balance sheet date. While techniques may vary, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amount payable in the future with respect to loss events that have occurred. As a result, uncertainties are imbedded in and permeate the actuarial loss reserving techniques and processes for all of Berkshire’s property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses. As of any balance sheet date, claims that have occurred have not all been reported, and if reported may not have been settled. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include provisions for those claims that have been reported (referred to as “case reserves”) and for those claims that have not been reported, referred to as incurred but not yet reported (“IBNR”) reserves. The time period between the occurrence date and payment date of a loss is referred to as the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within no more than a few years after occurrence. Casualty losses usually have very long claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal environment which contributes to the extended claim-tails. Receivables recorded with respect to insurance losses ceded to other reinsurers under reinsurance contracts are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses and, therefore, are also subject to estimation error. In addition to the factors cited above, reinsurance recoverables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders. Each of Berkshire’s insurance businesses utilize loss reserving techniques that are believed to best fit the business. Additional information regarding reserves established by each of the significant businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows. GEICO GEICO’s gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves as of December 31, 2006 were $6,095 million and net of reinsurance recoverables were $5,814 million. As of December 31, 2006, gross reserves included $4,315 million of reported average, case and case development reserves and $1,780 million of IBNR reserves. GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance which has a relatively short claim-tail. Accordingly, the risk of estimation error is thought to be much less at GEICO than for either General Re or BHRG. The key assumptions affecting GEICO’s reserves include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”), which includes loss adjustment expenses. GEICO’s reserving methodologies produce reserve estimates based upon the individual claims (or a “ground-up” approach), which in the aggregate yields a point estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Ranges of loss estimates are not determined in the aggregate. A detailed discussion of the process and significant factors considered in establishing reserves follows. 40 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserves using recognized standard statistical loss development methods and techniques. The significant reserve components (and percentage of gross reserves) are: (1) average reserves (20%), (2) case and case development reserves (50%), and (3) IBNR reserves (30%). Each component of loss reserves is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. Such amounts are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, rated state, reporting date and occurrence date, among other factors. A brief discussion of each component follows. Average reserve amounts are established for reported auto damage claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. The average reserves are established as a reasonable estimate for incurred claims for which claims adjusters have insufficient time and information to make a specific claim estimate. It also includes a large number of minor physical damage claims that are paid within a reasonably short time after being reported. Average reserve amounts are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened. The average severity per claim amount is developed by projecting the ultimate severity for each accident quarter and weighting with both reported claims and estimated unreported claims. Claims adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as soon as the specific facts and merits of each claim can be evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised as more information becomes known. For most liability coverages, case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim-tail, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is established. Therefore, additional case development reserve estimates are established, usually as a percentage of the case reserve. As of December 31, 2006, case development reserves averaged approximately 20% of total established case reserves. In general, case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves. Case development factors are reviewed and revised periodically. For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts, to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are subtracted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established through the collaborative effort of actuarial, claims and other management. For each of its major coverages, GEICO tests the adequacy of the total loss reserves using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. In 2006, claim frequencies were generally lower than expected and severity increases were generally not as great as originally projected. Loss reserve estimates recorded at the end of 2005 developed downward by approximately $410 million when reevaluated at December 31, 2006 producing a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2006. These downward reserve developments represented approximately 4% of earned premiums in 2006 and approximately 7% of the prior year-end reserve amount. Reserving assumptions at December 31, 2006 were modified appropriately to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future reserve development will depend on whether frequency and severity turn out to be more or less than anticipated. Within the automobile line of business the reserves with the most uncertainty are for automobile liability, due to the longer claim-tails for most of these coverages. Approximately 90% of GEICO’s reserves as of December 31, 2006 were for automobile liability, of which bodily injury (“BI”) coverage accounted for nearly 60% of the automobile liability reserves. Management believes it is reasonably possible that the average BI severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used. If actual BI severity changes one percentage point from what was used in establishing the reserves, the reserves would develop up or down by approximately $90 million resulting in a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to be different from expected would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. GEICO’s exposure to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining reserves associated with such exposure are currently a relatively insignificant component of GEICO’s total reserves (less than 3%) and there is little, if any, apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure. Related claim activity over the past year was insignificant. General Re and BHRG General Re’s and BHRG’s property and casualty loss reserves derive primarily from assumed reinsurance. Additional uncertainties unique to loss reserving processes for reinsurance are described below. The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which are affected by market conditions and practices) and other factors. Due to the lack of standardization of the terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts, the wide variability of coverage needs of individual clients and the tendency for those needs to change rapidly in response to market conditions, the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainties, in and of themselves, cannot be reliably measured. 41 Table of Contents Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re and BHRG (Continued) The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative, per occurrence excess contracts or retroactive contracts where company personnel work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract. Loss information from aggregate excess of loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Occasionally such information is reported in summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is provided through periodic reports and may include the amount of ceded losses paid where reimbursement is sought as well as case loss reserve estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers. Each of Berkshire’s reinsurance businesses has established practices to identify and gather needed information from clients. These practices include, for example, comparison of expected premiums to reported premiums to help identify delinquent client periodic reports, and claim reviews to facilitate loss reporting and identify inaccurate or incomplete claim reporting. These practices are periodically evaluated and changed as conditions, risk factors, and unanticipated areas of exposures are identified. The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is delayed in comparison with primary insurance. In some instances there are multiple reinsurers assuming and ceding parts of an underlying risk causing multiple contractual intermediaries between General Re or BHRG and the primary insured. In these instances, the delays in reporting can be compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer varies depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms and other factors. Contracts covering casualty losses on a per occurrence excess basis may experience longer delays in reporting due to the length of the claim tail as regards to the underlying claim. In addition, ceding companies may not report claims to the reinsurer until it becomes reasonably possible that the reinsurer will be affected, usually determined as a function of its estimate of the claim amount as a percentage of the reinsurance contract retention. On the other hand, the timing of reporting large per occurrence excess property losses or property catastrophe losses may not vary significantly from primary insurance. Under contracts where periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies, such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals which in the U.S. range from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. In continental Europe, reinsurance reporting practices vary. Fewer clients report premiums, losses, and case reserves on a quarterly basis. In certain countries, clients report on an annual basis and generally not until 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. Estimates of premiums and losses are accrued based on expected results supplemented when necessary for estimates of significant known events occurring in the interim. To monitor the timing and receipt of information due, client reporting requirements are tracked. When clients miss reporting deadlines, the clients are contacted. Premium and loss data is provided through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a greater risk that the loss data provided is incomplete, inaccurate or outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Reinsurance contracts generally allow for Berkshire’s reinsurance subsidiaries to have access to the cedant’s books and records as regards to the subject business and provide them the ability to conduct audits to determine the accuracy and completeness of information. Such audits are conducted when management deems it appropriate. In the regular course of business, disputes with clients may arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under the reinsurance policies. Most disputes are resolved by the claims departments by discussing coverage aspects with the appropriate client personnel or independent outside counsel review and determination. If disputes cannot be resolved, contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or alternative dispute resolution will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on Berkshire’s results of operations or financial condition. In summary, the scope, number and potential variability of assumptions required in estimating ultimate losses from reinsurance contracts of General Re and BHRG are more uncertain than primary property and casualty insurers due to the factors previously discussed. Additional information concerning General Re and BHRG follows. General Re General Re’s gross and net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and gross reserves by major line of businesses as of December 31, 2006 are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.

(2) Includes directors and officers and errors and omissions coverage. (3) Includes medical malpractice and umbrella coverage. 42 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) General Re’s process of establishing loss reserve estimates is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (“ACRs”) and IBNR reserves. Critical judgments in the establishment of these loss reserves may involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the expectation of ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and the case reserve reporting trends compared to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded reserve amounts are subject to “tail risk” where reported losses develop beyond the maximum expected loss emergence pattern time period. The company does not routinely determine loss reserve ranges because it believes that the techniques necessary have not sufficiently developed and the myriad of assumptions required render such resulting ranges to be unreliable. In addition, counts of claims or average amounts per claim are not utilized because clients do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail. Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners’ estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners’ estimates are significantly greater than the ceding company’s estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACRs are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2006, ACRs of $3.4 billion before discounts were concentrated in workers’ compensation and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. Examiners also periodically conduct claim reviews at client companies and case reserves are often increased as a result. In 2006, claim examiners conducted about 450 claim reviews. Actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (reserve cells) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative, and program) and line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, etc.). For each reserve cell, losses are aggregated by accident year and analyzed over time. Depending on client reporting practices, some losses and premiums are aggregated by policy year. These loss aggregations are internally called loss triangles, which serve as the primary basis for IBNR reserve calculations. Over 300 reserve cells are reviewed for North American business and approximately 900 reserve cells are reviewed with respect to international business. Loss triangles are used to determine the expected case loss emergence patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, are further used to determine IBNR reserves. Additional calculations form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern. The determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly a mechanical process. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, estimation formulas are used along with reliance on other loss triangles and judgment. Factors affecting loss development triangles include but are not limited to the following: changing client claims practices, changes in claim examiners’ use of ACRs or the frequency of client company claim reviews, changes in policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. These items influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns. Expected loss ratios are selected by reserve cell, by accident year, based upon reviewing forecasted losses and indicated ultimate loss ratios predicted from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premium. If the selected emergence pattern is not accurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios will not be accurate and this can affect the selected loss ratios and hence the IBNR reserve. As with selected loss emergence patterns, selecting expected loss ratios is not a strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing loss ratios. IBNR reserves are estimated by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, actuaries calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year. This calculation does not involve new assumptions and uses the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year. In 2006, reported losses for North American workers’ compensation risks (primarily pre-2002 occurrences) exceeded expectations. Claims data continued to show increased costs of long-term medical care and prescription drug costs and increased medical care utilization by claimants. These developments produced changes in expectations for future development of reported claims and resulted in increases in nominal ACRs. For prior years’ workers’ compensation losses, reported claims exceeded expected claims in 2006 by $19 million. These developments further precipitated a $132 million net increase in nominal IBNR reserve estimates for unreported occurrences. After deducting $33 million for the change in net reserve discounts during the year, workers’ compensation losses from prior years’ reduced pre-tax earnings in 2006 by $118 million. To illustrate the sensitivity of changes in expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios for General Re’s significant excess of loss workers’ compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves of approximately $548 million and $278 million on a discounted basis as of December 31, 2006. The increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. Management believes it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates. 43 Table of Contents Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) Other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) were favorable in 2006 relative to expectations after several years of relatively higher reported losses. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a single year (2006) means that loss reserve amounts currently established will continue to develop favorably. For General Re’s significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells (including medical malpractice, umbrella, auto and general liability), an increase of five points in the tails of the expected emergence patterns and an increase of five percent in expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $550 million. Management believes it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates in any of the aforementioned reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $550 million. Property losses were lower than expected (including losses related to the World Trade Center) but the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses. In response to favorable claim developments and another year of information, estimated remaining World Trade Center losses were reduced by $62 million in 2006, producing a corresponding increase in pre-tax earnings. In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (“D&O and E&O”) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected emergence patterns. These cells often involve a spike in loss activity arising from recent industry developments making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern. For example, the recent wave of corporate scandals has caused an increase in reported losses. For General Re’s large D&O and E&O reserve cells an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern (for those cells where emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $133 million. Management believes it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates. Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, “mass tort”) claims. Unpaid mass tort reserves at December 31, 2006 were approximately $1.9 billion gross and $1.2 billion net of reinsurance. Such reserves were approximately $1.8 billion gross and $1.3 billion net of reinsurance as of December 31, 2005. Claims paid attributable to such losses were about $97 million in 2006. In 2006, reserves for mass tort claims were increased in response to continued reports of losses and the increased uncertainty of how, when and how much these types of losses will develop over time. In 2006, IBNR reserve estimates for asbestos and environmental claims were increased by $58 million, which decreased pre-tax earnings by $58 million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, General Re considers “survival ratios” based on net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. The survival ratio was approximately 13 years as of December 31, 2006. The insurance industry’s comparable survival ratio for asbestos and pollution reserves was approximately nine years. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. BHRG BHRG’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2006 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions. Property Casualty Total Reported case reserves $ 2,385 $ 2,244 $ 4,629 IBNR reserves 1,082 3,067 4,149 Retroactive — 8,054 8,054 Gross reserves $ 3,467 $ 13,365 16,832 Deferred charges and ceded reserves (2,577 ) Net reserves $ 14,255 In general, the methodologies used to establish loss reserves vary widely and encompass many of the common methodologies employed in the actuarial field today. Certain traditional methodologies such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques are utilized. Additional judgments must also be employed to consider changes in contract conditions and terms as well as the incidence of litigation or legal and regulatory change. As of December 31, 2006, BHRG’s gross loss reserves related to retroactive reinsurance policies were attributed to casualty losses. Retroactive policies include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses (relating to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date) above a contractual retention are indemnified or contracts that indemnify all losses paid by the counterparty after the policy effective date. Retroactive losses paid in 2006 were $858 million, essentially all of which pertained to pre-2006 contracts. The classification “reported case reserves” has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since the amount is often derived from reports in bulk from ceding companies, who may have inconsistent definitions of “case reserves.” Reserves are reviewed and established in the aggregate by contract including provisions for IBNR reserves. 44 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG (Continued) In establishing retroactive reinsurance reserves, historical aggregate loss payment patterns are analyzed and projected into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. Management assigns judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. Management monitors claim payment activity and reviews ceding company reports or other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, management reassesses expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process. During 2006, retroactive reserves developed downward by approximately $235 million, due primarily to commutations of contracts where final loss payments were less than the recorded reserves. BHRG’s liabilities for environmental, asbestos, and latent injury losses and loss adjustment expenses are presently concentrated within retroactive reinsurance contracts. Reserves for such losses were approximately $3.8 billion at December 31, 2006 and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2005. Losses paid in 2006 were approximately $300 million. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not regularly receive reliable information regarding numbers of asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from ceding companies on a consistent basis, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess of loss policies. Periodically, a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data of the reinsured is conducted to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, estimates can only be developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. The increasing number of bankruptcies of asbestos manufacturers has adversely impacted trends in recent years. Potential legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on establishing loss reserves for mass tort claims in the future. The maximum losses payable by BHRG under retroactive policies are not expected to exceed approximately $10.8 billion as of December 31, 2006. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, management believes it unlikely that unpaid losses as of December 31, 2006 ($8.1 billion) will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15%. A significant number of recent reinsurance contracts are expected to have a low frequency of claim occurrence combined with a potential for high severity of claims. These include losses from catastrophes, terrorism, and aviation risks under catastrophe and individual risk contracts. Loss reserves related to catastrophe and individual risk contracts decreased from approximately $3.5 billion at year end 2005 to approximately $2.2 billion at year end 2006. The decrease in reserves reflected loss payments in 2006 of approximately $1.7 billion that were primarily attributable to the major hurricanes that occurred in 2005. Partially offsetting the effect of the loss payments were increases in loss reserves on pre-2006 events of approximately $200 million that produced a corresponding charge to pre-tax earnings in 2006. The reserve increases were primarily due to higher than expected reported losses on Hurricane Wilma which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Catastrophe loss reserves are provided when it is probable that an insured loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event. Other reinsurance reserve amounts are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on an individual contract basis, supplemented by management’s judgment of the impact on each contract of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon management’s judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding company’s loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared. Other Critical Accounting Policies Berkshire records as assets deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the difference between the consideration received and the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period and are reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss expenses. The deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of loss payments. Adjustments to these assumptions are applied retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were $2.0 billion at December 31, 2006. Significant changes in the amount and payment timing of estimated unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization. Berkshire’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately $32.2 billion. A significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests. Such tests include periodically determining or reviewing the estimated fair value of Berkshire’s reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings and multiples of earnings. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then individual assets, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is then charged to earnings as an impairment loss. 45 Table of Contents Other Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) Berkshire’s consolidated financial position reflects very significant amounts of invested assets. A substantial portion of these assets are carried at fair values based upon current market quotations and, when not available, based upon fair value pricing models. Certain of Berkshire’s fixed maturity securities are not actively traded in the financial markets. Further, Berkshire’s finance businesses maintain significant balances of finance receivables, which are carried at amortized cost. Considerable judgment is required in determining the assumptions used in certain valuation models, including interest rate, loan prepayment speed, credit risk and liquidity risk assumptions. Significant changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on carrying values. Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements which are not yet effective is included in Note 1(r) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Berkshire does not expect that the adoption of any of the recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on its financial condition. Market Risk Disclosures Berkshire’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Berkshire’s significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with Berkshire’s business activities. Interest Rate Risk Berkshire’s management prefers to invest in equity securities or to acquire entire businesses based upon the principles discussed in the following section on equity price risk. When unable to do so, management may alternatively invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Berkshire’s strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur. Further, Berkshire strives to maintain the highest credit ratings so that the cost of debt is minimized. Berkshire utilizes derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks on a limited basis. The fair values of Berkshire’s fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. Fixed interest rate investments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate investments. The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk. The hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Berkshire’s management prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Accordingly, Berkshire’s equity investments are generally concentrated in relatively few investees. At December 31, 2006, 54% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated in four investees. Berkshire’s preferred strategy is to hold equity investments for very long periods of time. Thus, Berkshire’s management is not troubled by short-term equity price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. Berkshire strives to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short-term equity price volatility. The carrying values of investments subject to equity price risk are, in almost all instances, based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet dates. Market prices are subject to fluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. Furthermore, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold. The table which follows summarizes Berkshire’s equity price risk as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in Berkshire’s equity investment portfolio. Dollars are in millions. Estimated Hypothetical Fair Value after Percentage Hypothetical Hypothetical Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value Price Change Change in Prices Shareholders’ Equity As of December 31, 2006 $ 61,533 30% increase $ 79,993 11.0 30% decrease 43,073 (11.0 ) As of December 31, 2005 $ 46,721 30% increase $ 60,737 9.9 30% decrease 32,705 (9.9 ) Berkshire is also subject to equity price risk with respect to certain long duration equity index option contracts. Berkshire’s maximum exposure with respect to such contracts was approximately $21 billion and $14 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These contracts generally expire 15 to 20 years from inception and they may not be settled before their respective expiration dates. The contracts have been written on four major equity indexes including three that are foreign. While Berkshire’s ultimate potential loss with respect to these contracts is directly correlated to the movement of the underlying stock index between contract inception date and expiration, the change in fair value from current changes in the indices do not produce a proportional change in the estimated fair value of the contracts. Other factors (such as expected future interest rates, dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract as well as the general market assumptions) affect the estimates of fair value reflected in the financial statements. Thus, if the underlying indices declined 30% immediately, and absent changes in other factors, Berkshire estimates that it could incur a non-cash pre-tax loss of approximately $2 billion from the change in the estimated fair value of open contracts as of December 31, 2006. Foreign Currency Risk Market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates are currently concentrated in a portfolio of long duration equity index option contracts on foreign equity indexes. In 2005, Berkshire also had significant exposure to foreign currency risk from a portfolio of short duration forward contracts. The aggregate notional value of forward contracts was approximately $1 billion as of December 31, 2006 compared to approximately $13.8 billion as of December 31, 2005. The following table summarizes the outstanding derivatives contracts as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 with foreign currency risk and shows the estimated changes in values of the contracts assuming changes in the underlying exchange rates applied immediately and uniformly across all currencies. The changes in value do not necessarily reflect the best or worst case scenarios and actual results may differ. Dollars are in millions.

Exposures include variations in the price of wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold, fuel costs to generate electricity, and natural gas supply for regulated retail gas customers. Electricity and natural gas prices are subject to wide price swings as demand responds to, among many other items, changing weather, limited storage, transmission and transportation constraints, and lack of alternative supplies from other areas. To mitigate a portion of the risk, MidAmerican uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other over-the-counter agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Accordingly, the net unrealized gains and losses associated with interim price movements on such contracts are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Financial results may be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel and or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. MidAmerican also uses futures, options and swap agreements to economically hedge gas and electric commodity prices for physical delivery to non-regulated customers. MidAmerican does not engage in a material amount of proprietary trading activities. The table that follows summarizes Berkshire’s commodity risk on energy derivative contracts as of December 31, 2006 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of that date.

Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects, and possible future Company actions, which may be provided by management are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions about the Company, economic and market factors and the industries in which the Company does business, among other things. These statements are not guaranties of future performance and the Company has no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal important risk factors that could cause the Company’s actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of Berkshire’s significant equity investees, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane or an act of terrorism that causes losses insured by Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries, changes in insurance laws or regulations, changes in Federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which Berkshire and its affiliates do business. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 48 Table of Contents Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006. Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears below. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. February 26, 2007 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying, Management’s Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements with an explanatory paragraph relating to the change in the Company’s accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).

In reinsurance activities, Berkshire subsidiaries assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Berkshire’s principal insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Berkshire’s management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing, with limited exceptions at GEICO and General Re’s international operations, is the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, Berkshire evaluates performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income. Periodic underwriting results can be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. See the Critical Accounting Policies section of this discussion for information concerning the loss reserve estimation process. In addition, the timing and amount of catastrophe losses produce significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. During the third quarter of 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck the Gulf Coast region of the United States producing the largest catastrophe losses for any quarter in the history of the property/casualty insurance industry. In the fourth quarter of 2005, Hurricane Wilma struck the Southeast U.S. Estimated pre-tax losses from these events of $3.4 billion were recorded in 2005. In contrast, there were no significant losses from major catastrophe events in 2006 or 2007. 29 Table of Contents Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) A key marketing strategy followed by all of these businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of Berkshire’s insurance businesses was approximately $62 billion at December 31, 2007. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers. Additional information regarding Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance operations follows. GEICO GEICO provides primarily private passenger automobile coverages to insureds in 49 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet, over the telephone or through the mail. This is a significant element in GEICO’s strategy to be a low-cost insurer. In addition, GEICO strives to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICO’s underwriting results for the past three years are summarized below. Dollars are in millions. 2007 2006 2005 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 11,931 $ 11,303 $ 10,285 Premiums earned $ 11,806 100.0 $ 11,055 100.0 $ 10,101 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 8,523 72.2 7,749 70.1 7,128 70.6 Underwriting expenses 2,170 18.4 1,992 18.0 1,752 17.3 Total losses and expenses 10,693 90.6 9,741 88.1 8,880 87.9 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 1,113 $ 1,314 $ 1,221 * * Net of losses of $200 million from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Premiums earned in 2007 and 2006 increased 6.8% and 9.4%, respectively, over the corresponding prior year amounts. The growth in premiums earned for voluntary auto in 2007 was 6.6%, which was less than the 8.8% increase in policies-in-force during the past year as average premiums per policy continue to slowly decline. Average premiums per policy in 2008 are expected to be relatively unchanged from 2007. Policies-in-force also increased over the last twelve months in the preferred risk markets (8.4%) and in the standard and nonstandard markets (10.0%). Voluntary auto new business sales increased 5.0% in 2007 as compared to the prior year. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2007 were 656,000 higher than at December 31, 2006. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2007 were $8,523 million, an increase of 10.0% over 2006. The loss ratio increased to 72.2% in 2007 compared to 70.1% in 2006 and 70.6% in 2005. The increase in the loss ratio in 2007 in part reflects the aforementioned decline in average premiums per policy attributable to rate decreases. In 2007, claims frequencies for physical damage coverages increased in the two to four percent range over 2006 while frequencies for injury coverages decreased in the three to five percent range. Physical damage severities increased in the second half of 2007 at an annualized rate of two to four percent. Injury severities also began to increase in the latter part of 2007 at an annualized rate of three to six percent. Incurred losses from catastrophe events were approximately $34 million in 2007, $54 million in 2006 and $227 million in 2005 (primarily from the hurricanes in the third and fourth quarters). Underwriting expenses in 2007 were $2,170 million, an increase of 8.9% over 2006, which increased 13.7% over 2005. The increases in expenses in both years primarily reflected higher advertising costs as well as increased personnel costs to service the growth of policies-in-force. General Re General Re conducts a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. Property and casualty reinsurance is written in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through 95% owned Cologne Re (based in Germany) and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written worldwide through Cologne Re. General Re strives to generate underwriting gains in essentially all of its product lines. Underwriting performance is not evaluated based upon market share and underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Re’s underwriting results are summarized for the past three years in the following table. Amounts are in millions. Pre-tax underwriting Premiums written Premiums earned gain (loss) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Property/casualty $ 3,478 $ 3,581 $ 3,852 $ 3,614 $ 3,711 $ 4,140 $ 475 $ 373 $ (445) * Life/health 2,479 2,368 2,303 2,462 2,364 2,295 80 153 111 $ 5,957 $ 5,949 $ 6,155 $ 6,076 $ 6,075 $ 6,435 $ 555 $ 526 $ (334 ) * Includes losses of $685 million from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. 30 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) Property/casualty Premiums written in 2007 declined 2.9% from amounts written in 2006 which declined 7.0% from amounts written in 2005. Premiums written in 2007 included $114 million with respect to a reinsurance to close transaction that increased General Re’s economic interest in the runoff of the Lloyd’s Syndicate 435’s 2001 year of account from 60% to 100%. There was no similar transaction in 2006 or 2005. Excluding the effect of the reinsurance to close transaction and the effects of foreign currency translation, premiums written declined 10.9% when compared to 2006 which decreased 5.7% when compared to 2005. Premiums earned in 2007 declined 2.6% from amounts earned in 2006 which declined 10.4% from amounts earned in 2005. Excluding the effects of the reinsurance to close transaction discussed above and the effects of foreign currency translation, premiums earned declined 10.1% in 2007 as compared to 2006 and 11.3% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The overall comparative declines in written and earned premiums in the past three years reflected continued underwriting discipline by rejecting transactions where pricing is deemed inadequate with respect to the risk as well as significant decreases in finite risk business. Competition within the industry could lead to further declines in 2008. Pre-tax underwriting results in 2007 included $519 million in underwriting gains from property business partially offset by $44 million in underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business. The property business produced underwriting gains of $90 million for the 2007 accident year and $429 million from favorable run-off of prior years’ property losses. Although the current accident year results included $192 million of catastrophe losses, property results generally reflected relatively low loss levels. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual losses produces significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. The pre-tax underwriting losses from casualty business in 2007 included $120 million of workers’ compensation accretion of discount and deferred charge amortization, as well as legal costs associated with various ongoing finite reinsurance investigations. These charges were largely offset by underwriting gains in other casualty business. Pre-tax underwriting results in 2006 included $708 million in underwriting gains from property business partially offset by $335 million in underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business and legal and estimated settlement costs associated with the finite reinsurance investigations. The property business produced underwriting gains of $317 million for the 2006 accident year and $391 million from favorable run-off of prior years’ losses. The 2006 accident year results also benefited from a lack of catastrophe losses. The underwriting losses from casualty business in 2006 included $137 million in discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, increases in prior years’ workers’ compensation reserves of $103 million arising from the continuing escalation of medical utilization and cost inflation as well as increases in asbestos and environmental reserves which were somewhat offset by net decreases in prior years’ reserves for other casualty coverages. The 2005 pre-tax underwriting loss of $445 million included approximately $685 million in losses from three major hurricanes in 2005 (Katrina, Rita and Wilma). Otherwise, underwriting results for the 2005 accident year generally benefited from re-pricing efforts and improved coverage terms and conditions put into place over the preceding few years as well as favorable aviation and non-catastrophe property business. Underwriting results in 2005 also included losses attributable to prior accident years consisting of net reserve increases on workers’ compensation of $228 million, asbestos and environmental mass tort exposures of $102 million and $136 million in discount accretion and deferred charge amortization. Offsetting these prior years’ losses were $527 million in gains from net reserve decreases in other casualty lines and property lines. Life/health Premiums earned in 2007 increased 4.1% over 2006 which increased 3.0% over 2005. Adjusting for the effects of foreign currency translation, premiums earned were relatively unchanged in 2007 and increased 2.3% in 2006 when compared to 2005. The increase in premiums earned in 2006 was primarily from life business in Europe. Underwriting results for the global life/health operations produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $80 million in 2007, $153 million in 2006 and $111 million in 2005. Results for continuing operations were profitable in each of the past three years primarily due to favorable mortality with respect to life business. Included in the underwriting results for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $105 million, $31 million and $66 million, respectively, of net losses attributable to reserve increases on certain U.S. health coverages related to workers’ compensation and long-term-care business that has been in run-off for several years. 31 Table of Contents Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) underwrites excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages for insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG’s business includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and excess direct and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual discrete property risks referred to as individual risk. Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Other multi-line refers to other business written on both a quota-share and excess basis, participations in and contracts with Lloyd’s syndicates as well as property, aviation and workers’ compensation programs. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce extraordinary volatility in BHRG’s periodic underwriting results. BHRG’s underwriting results are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Catastrophe and individual risk $ 1,577 $ 2,196 $ 1,663 $ 1,477 $ 1,588 $ (1,178 ) Retroactive reinsurance 7,708 146 10 (375 ) (173 ) (214 ) Other multi-line 2,617 2,634 2,290 325 243 323 $ 11,902 $ 4,976 $ 3,963 $ 1,427 $ 1,658 $ (1,069) * * Includes losses of $2.5 billion from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Catastrophe and individual risk contracts may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification, often several hundred million dollars and occasionally in excess of $1 billion, and cover catastrophe risks (such as hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters) or other property risks (such as aviation and aerospace, commercial multi-peril or terrorism). Premiums earned from catastrophe and individual risk contracts in 2007 declined 28% from 2006 which increased 32% over 2005. Catastrophe and individual risk premiums written were approximately $1.2 billion in 2007, $2.4 billion in 2006 and $1.8 billion in 2005. The decrease in written and earned premiums in 2007 was principally attributable to increased industry capacity for catastrophe reinsurance which has produced increased price competition and fewer opportunities to write business. The level of catastrophe and individual risk business written in a given period will vary significantly based upon market conditions and management’s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. The underwriting results from catastrophe and individual risk business in 2007 and 2006 reflected no significant losses from catastrophe events during those years. In 2006, BHRG incurred losses of approximately $200 million attributable to prior years’ events, primarily Hurricane Wilma which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. The underwriting results in 2005 included estimated losses of approximately $2.4 billion from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. The timing and magnitude of losses produce extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results of BHRG’s catastrophe and individual risk business. BHRG does not cede catastrophe and individual risks to mitigate the volatility. Management accepts such potential volatility provided that the long-term prospect of achieving underwriting profits is reasonable. Retroactive policies normally provide very large, but limited, indemnification of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events that are expected to be paid over long periods of time. The underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance are primarily attributable to the amortization of deferred charges established on the contracts. At the inception of the contract, deferred charges represent the difference between the premium received and the estimated ultimate loss reserves payable. Deferred charges are amortized over the estimated claims payment period using the interest method. The amortization charges are based on the estimated timing and amount of loss payments and are recorded as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. Premiums earned from retroactive reinsurance in 2007 included $7.1 billion from the Equitas reinsurance agreement which became effective on March 30, 2007. See Note 11 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. At the inception of the Equitas contract, estimated liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses of $9.3 billion and an asset for deferred charges reinsurance assumed of $2.2 billion were recorded. At December 31, 2007, unamortized deferred charges for all of BHRG’s retroactive contracts (including the Equitas contract) were approximately $3.8 billion and gross unpaid losses were approximately $17.3 billion. The underwriting loss from retroactive policies in 2007 included deferred charge amortization of $156 million on contracts written in 2007 (primarily the Equitas contract). There were no significant reserve changes in 2007 related to pre-2007 contracts. Underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance in 2006 are net of gains of approximately $145 million which primarily derived from contracts that were commuted or amended during the last half of 2006. Underwriting losses in 2005 from retroactive reinsurance are net of a gain of approximately $46 million related to the commutation of a contract. Other multi-line premiums earned in 2007 reflect significant increases in property business and significant decreases in casualty excess reinsurance. In addition, the management of certain workers’ compensation business was transferred to the Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and the results for this business are now included in that group’s results. Premiums earned from other multi-line business increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to growth in workers’ compensation business. Multi-line business produced a pre-tax underwriting gain of $325 million in 2007 and $243 million in 2006 reflecting relatively low loss ratios on property business and favorable loss experience on workers’ compensation business. Underwriting results in 2005 included estimated losses of approximately $100 million from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. 32 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Effective January 1, 2008, BHRG entered into a reinsurance agreement with Swiss Reinsurance Company and its property-casualty affiliates (“Swiss Re”). Under the agreement, BHRG will assume a 20% quota-share of the premiums and related losses and expenses on all property-casualty risks of Swiss Re incepting over the five year period ending December 31, 2012. If recent years’ volumes were to continue over the next five years, the annual written premium assumed under this agreement would be in the $3 billion range, however actual premiums assumed over the five year period could vary significantly depending on market conditions and opportunities. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group Berkshire’s primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of smaller insurance businesses that principally write liability coverages for commercial accounts. These businesses include: National Indemnity Company’s primary group operation (“NICO Primary Group”), a writer of motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as “Homestate” operations, providers of standard multi-line insurance; and Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions. Also included are Medical Protective Corporation (“MedPro”), a provider of professional liability insurance to physicians, dentists and other healthcare providers acquired on June 30, 2005 and Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers’ compensation solutions acquired on May 19, 2006. Underwriting results for these two businesses are included in the Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group results beginning on their respective acquisition dates. Collectively, Berkshire’s primary insurance businesses produced earned premiums of $1,999 million in 2007, $1,858 million in 2006 and $1,498 million in 2005. The significant increase in premiums earned in 2006 was primarily attributable to the impact of the MedPro and Applied Underwriters acquisitions partially offset by a decline in volume of the NICO Primary Group. Pre-tax underwriting gains as percentages of premiums earned were approximately 14% in 2007, 18% in 2006 and 16% in 2005. Underwriting gains were achieved by all significant primary insurance businesses. Insurance — Investment Income A summary of the net investment income of Berkshire’s insurance operations for the past three years follows. Amounts are in millions. 2007 2006 2005 Investment income before taxes $ 4,758 $ 4,316 $ 3,480 Income taxes and minority interests 1,248 1,196 1,068 Investment income after taxes and minority interests $ 3,510 $ 3,120 $ 2,412 Investment income consists of interest and dividends earned on cash equivalents and fixed maturity and equity investments of Berkshire’s insurance businesses. Pre-tax investment income earned in 2007 by Berkshire’s insurance businesses increased $442 million (10%) over 2006 which increased $836 million (24%) over 2005. The increases in 2007 and 2006 over the preceding year reflect increased invested assets, higher short-term interest rates in the United States and increased dividend rates on certain equity investments. A summary of cash and investments held in Berkshire’s insurance businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. 2007 2006 2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 28,257 $ 34,590 $ 38,814 Equity securities 74,681 61,168 46,412 Fixed maturity securities 27,922 25,272 27,385 $ 130,860 $ 121,030 $ 112,611 Fixed maturity investments as of December 31, 2007 were as follows. Amounts are in millions. Amortized Unrealized cost gains/losses Fair value U.S. Treasury, government corporations and agencies $ 3,487 $ 59 $ 3,546 States, municipalities and political subdivisions 2,120 104 2,224 Foreign governments 9,529 29 9,558 Corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, investment grade 4,223 64 4,287 Corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, non-investment grade 3,589 1,075 4,664 Mortgage-backed securities 3,592 51 3,643 $ 26,540 $ 1,382 $ 27,922 All U.S. government obligations are rated AAA by the major rating agencies and approximately 96% of all state, municipal and political subdivisions, foreign government obligations and mortgage-backed securities were rated AA or higher. Non-investment grade securities represent securities that are rated below BBB- or Baa3. 33 Table of Contents Insurance — Investment Income (Continued) Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities assumed under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $59 billion at December 31, 2007, $51 billion at December 31, 2006 and $49 billion at December 31, 2005. The increase in float in 2007 was principally due to the Equitas reinsurance transaction. The cost of float, as represented by the ratio of underwriting gain or loss to average float, was negative for the last three years, as Berkshire’s insurance businesses generated underwriting gains in each year. Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) Revenues and earnings of MidAmerican for each of the past three years are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 MidAmerican Energy Company $ 4,325 $ 3,519 $ 3,200 $ 412 $ 348 $ 288 PacifiCorp 4,319 2,971 — 692 356 — Natural gas pipelines 1,088 972 909 473 376 309 U.K. utilities 1,114 961 921 337 338 308 Real estate brokerage 1,511 1,724 1,894 42 74 148 Other 271 497 356 130 245 124 $ 12,628 $ 10,644 $ 7,280 Earnings before corporate interest and taxes 2,086 1,737 1,177 Interest, other than to Berkshire (312 ) (261 ) (200 ) Interest on Berkshire junior debt (108 ) (134 ) (157 ) Income taxes and minority interests ** (477 ) (426 ) (257 ) Net earnings $ 1,189 $ 916 $ 563 Earnings applicable to Berkshire * $ 1,114 $ 885 $ 523 Debt owed to others at December 31 19,002 16,946 10,296 Debt owed to Berkshire at December 31 821 1,055 1,289 * Net of minority interests and includes interest earned by Berkshire (net of related income taxes). ** Net of $58 million deferred income tax benefit in 2007 as a result of the reduction in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate from 30% to 28% which was enacted during the third quarter of 2007 and will be effective in 2008. Includes additional income tax charges of $49 million in 2005 related to Berkshire’s accounting for MidAmerican under the equity method. Revenues in 2007 from MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) increased $806 million (23%) over 2006. MEC’s non-regulated energy sales in 2007 exceeded 2006 by $597 million primarily due to increased electric sales volume and prices driven by improved market opportunities. MEC’s regulated retail and wholesale electricity sales in 2007 exceeded 2006 by $155 million, which reflected the impact of new generating assets in 2007 and improved market opportunities in wholesale markets as well as higher unit sales attributable to warmer summer temperatures and increases in the average number of retail customers. Earnings before corporate interest and taxes (“EBIT”) of MEC in 2007 increased $64 million (18%), reflecting the margins on the increases in regulated and nonregulated energy sales, partially offset by higher facilities operating and maintenance costs. Revenues in 2007 from PacifiCorp increased $1,348 million (45%) versus 2006. Revenues and EBIT of PacifiCorp for 2006 in the preceding table are included beginning as of the acquisition date (March 21, 2006). EBIT of PacifiCorp in 2007 increased $336 million (94%) versus 2006. In 2007, PacifiCorp’s revenues and EBIT were favorably impacted by regulatory-approved rate increases and higher customer usage in retail markets, as well as increased margins on wholesale electricity sales, partially offset by higher fuel and purchased power costs. Fuel costs increased due to the higher volumes and because of higher average unit costs. Revenues in 2007 from natural gas pipelines increased $116 million (12%) over 2006 due primarily to higher demand and rates resulting from favorable market conditions and because revenues in 2006 reflected the impact of estimated rate case refunds to customers with respect to an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. EBIT in 2007 from natural gas pipelines increased $97 million (26%) over 2006 mainly due to comparatively higher revenue and lower depreciation due to expected changes in depreciation rates in connection with a current rate proceeding. Revenues from U.K. utilities in 2007 increased over the comparable 2006 period primarily attributable to the strengthening of the Pound Sterling versus the U.S. dollar as well as higher gas production and electricity distribution revenues. EBIT from the U.K. utilities in 2007 was essentially unchanged compared to 2006 as higher maintenance and depreciation costs and the write-off of unsuccessful gas exploration costs offset the impact of higher revenues. Revenues and EBIT from real estate brokerage declined 12% and 43%, respectively, compared to 2006, primarily due to significantly lower transaction volume as a result of the slowdown in U.S. residential real estate activity. Revenues and EBIT from other activities in 2006 included pre-tax gains of $117 million which was primarily from the disposal of equity securities. There were no significant securities gains in 2007. 34 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing Revenues and pre-tax earnings of the manufacturing, service and retailing businesses for each of the past three years follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 McLane Company $ 28,079 $ 25,693 $ 24,074 $ 232 $ 229 $ 217 Shaw Industries 5,373 5,834 5,723 436 594 485 Other manufacturing 14,459 11,988 9,260 2,037 1,756 1,335 Other service * 7,792 5,811 4,728 968 658 329 Retailing 3,397 3,334 3,111 274 289 257 $ 59,100 $ 52,660 $ 46,896 Pre-tax earnings $ 3,947 $ 3,526 $ 2,623 Income taxes and minority interests 1,594 1,395 977 $ 2,353 $ 2,131 $ 1,646 * Management evaluates the results of NetJets using accounting standards for recognition of revenue and planned major maintenance expenses that were generally accepted when Berkshire acquired NetJets but are no longer acceptable due to subsequent changes in accounting standards adopted by the FASB. Revenues and pre-tax earnings for the other services businesses shown above reflect these prior revenue and expense recognition methods. Revenues shown in this table are greater than the amounts reported in Berkshire’s consolidated financial statements by $709 million in 2007, $781 million in 2006 and $704 million in 2005. Pre-tax earnings included in this table for 2007, 2006 and 2005 exceed the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements by $48 million, $79 million and $63 million, respectively. McLane Company McLane Company, Inc., (“McLane”) is a wholesale distributor of grocery and non-food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. McLane’s business is marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins. McLane’s revenues in 2007 increased $2,386 million (9%) as compared to 2006 which increased $1,619 million (7%) as compared to 2005. The comparative revenue increases reflect additional grocery and foodservice customers as well as manufacturer price increases and state excise tax increases which are passed on to customers. Pre-tax earnings in 2007 increased $3 million over 2006 which increased $12 million over 2005. The increases reflect the increase in sales volume, partially offset by lower gross margins. The gross margin rate in 2007 was 5.79% versus 5.85% in 2006 and 5.98% in 2005. In 2007, the gross margin rate was negatively impacted by excise tax increases as well as the effects of increased competition. The impact of the reduced gross margin rate was partially offset by a decline in other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Pre-tax earnings in 2007 also included a $10 million gain from a litigation settlement, which was offset by an asset write down at a small novelty items distribution subsidiary. Approximately 33% of McLane’s annual revenues are from sales to Wal-Mart. A curtailment of purchasing by Wal-Mart could have a material adverse impact on the earnings of McLane. Shaw Industries Shaw Industries (“Shaw”) is the world’s largest manufacturer of tufted broadloom carpets and is a full-service flooring company. Revenues of $5,373 million in 2007 declined $461 million (8%) from 2006. In 2007, carpet volume decreased 10% versus 2006 due to lower sales in residential markets, partially offset by a modest increase in commercial market volume. The continued slowdown in new housing construction is the primary driver behind lower residential market sales. In 2007, pre-tax earnings decreased $158 million (27%) compared to 2006. The decline reflects the aforementioned lower sales volume and higher product costs due primarily to comparatively higher raw material prices and lower manufacturing efficiencies as a result of decreased production. These factors combined to produce declines in gross margin dollars in 2007 of approximately 17% versus 2006. Selling, general and administrative costs in 2007 declined approximately 6% compared with 2006, reflecting lower sales volume and expense control efforts. Residential housing construction activity is expected to remain slow during 2008 and as a result, revenues and earnings will likely decline further. In 2006, revenues increased $111 million (2%) and pre-tax earnings of $594 million increased $109 million (22%) as compared to 2005. The increase in revenues reflected a 7% increase in the average square yard selling price for carpet, partially offset by a 6% reduction in square yards sold. The comparative decline in 2006 square yards sold versus 2005 accelerated during the third and fourth quarters which was attributable to the slowing of single-family housing construction and the effects of accelerated customer purchases during the second half of 2005 in anticipation of price increases. The increase in pre-tax earnings in 2006 over 2005 was primarily generated in the first six months of the year and was mainly attributable to a reduction in manufacturing cost per unit deriving from the integration of carpet backing and nylon-fiber manufacturing operations acquired by Shaw in the fourth quarter of 2005. Other manufacturing Berkshire’s other manufacturing businesses include a wide array of businesses. Included in this group are several manufacturers of building products (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville and MiTek) and apparel (Fruit of the Loom (includes the Russell athletic apparel and sporting goods business acquired in August 2006 and the women’s intimate apparel business acquired from VF Corporation in April 2007), Garan, Fechheimers, Justin Brands and the H.H. Brown Shoe Group). Also included in this group are Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehicles and the ISCAR Metalworking 35 Table of Contents Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Other manufacturing (Continued) Companies (“IMC”), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide that was acquired in July 2006. In July 2007, Berkshire acquired two leading jewelry manufacturing and distribution companies (“Richline”) that design, manufacture and distribute karat gold, silver and gem set jewelry to mass merchandisers, large jewelry chains, department stores and home shopping networks. There are numerous other manufacturers of consumer and commercial products in this diverse group. Revenues in 2007 from other manufacturing activities were $14,459 million, an increase of $2,471 million (21%) over 2006. The comparative increase was primarily attributable to the businesses acquired since mid-2006 as well as a significant increase from CTB, a manufacturer of equipment for the livestock and agricultural industries. Revenues from the building products businesses declined $292 million in 2007 as demand for their products was negatively affected by the general slowdown in housing construction activity. Pre-tax earnings of the other manufacturing businesses were $2,037 million in 2007, an increase of $281 million (16%) over 2006. The increases were primarily due to full-year inclusion in 2007 of IMC and increased earnings of CTB, partially offset by a 22% decline in earnings of the building products businesses. Revenues and earnings from the building products businesses will likely decline further in 2008 as a result of the continued weakness in residential housing construction. Additionally, pre-tax earnings of Fruit of the Loom declined in 2007 as a result of operating losses from the newly acquired women’s intimate apparel operations. Revenues of the other manufacturing businesses in 2006 increased $2,728 million (29%) and pre-tax earnings increased $421 million (32%) as compared to 2005. The acquisitions of Forest River (acquired August 2005), IMC and Russell Corporation account for a substantial portion of these increases. Additionally, the building products group of businesses reported increases in revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2006 as compared to the prior year. Other service Berkshire’s other service businesses include NetJets, the world’s leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft and ships. Among other businesses included in this group are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor (acquired March 2007); Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings (acquired February 2006); The Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools; International Dairy Queen, a licensor and service provider to about 6,000 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; The Buffalo News, a publisher of a daily and Sunday newspaper; and businesses that provide management and other services to insurance companies. Revenues from the other service businesses in 2007 increased $1,981 million (34%) and pre-tax earnings increased $310 million (47%) as compared to 2006. The increase in revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2007 versus 2006 was attributable to the impact of business acquisitions (primarily TTI and Business Wire) as well as increased revenues and pre-tax earnings from FlightSafety and NetJets. Both of these businesses benefited in 2007 from higher equipment (simulators and aircraft) utilization rates and from increased customer demand. Revenues from the other service businesses in 2006 increased $1,083 million (23%) and pre-tax earnings increased $329 million (100%) as compared to 2005. These increases derived from significantly improved operating results of NetJets, as well as increases in revenues and earnings for FlightSafety and the inclusion of the results of Business Wire. NetJets’ revenues in 2006 increased $759 million as compared to 2005 and pre-tax earnings in 2006 were $143 million compared to a pre-tax loss of $80 million in 2005. In 2006, occupied flight hours increased 19% and average hourly rates increased as well. The improvement in operating results at NetJets also reflected a substantial decline in the cost of subcontracted flights that were necessary to meet peak customer demand. Retailing Berkshire’s retailing operations consist of several home furnishings (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s) and jewelry (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge) retailers. Also included in this group is See’s Candies. Revenues of $3.4 billion in 2007 increased $63 million (2%) versus 2006. Pre-tax earnings in 2007 of the retailing businesses decreased $15 million (5%) compared to 2006 and was primarily attributable to lower revenues and earnings from jewelry stores. Revenues of the retail group in 2006 were $3.3 billion, an increase of $223 million (7%) versus 2005. Pre-tax earnings in 2006 were $289 million, an increase of $32 million (12%) over 2005. Home furnishings revenues in 2006 included sales from two new R.C. Willey stores of $77 million. In addition, same store home furnishings sales in 2006 increased approximately 6% compared to 2005. A significant portion of the increase in pre-tax earnings was due to a $27 million increase at See’s Candies. 36 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Finance and Financial Products A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings from Berkshire’s finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Manufactured housing and finance $ 3,665 $ 3,570 $ 3,175 $ 526 $ 513 $ 416 Furniture/transportation equipment leasing 810 880 856 111 182 173 Other 644 674 528 369 462 233 $ 5,119 $ 5,124 $ 4,559 Pre-tax earnings 1,006 1,157 822 Income taxes and minority interests 374 425 308 $ 632 $ 732 $ 514 Revenues from manufactured housing and finance activities (Clayton Homes) increased $95 million (3%) as compared to 2006. In 2007, interest income from financing activities increased $70 million (7%) over 2006 reflecting higher average installment loan balances. Installment loan balances outstanding as of December 31, 2007 were approximately $11.1 billion compared to $9.9 billion and $9.5 billion at the end of 2006 and 2005. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes increased $13 million (3%) over 2006 reflecting a $30 million increase in net interest earned and lower credit losses partially offset by an overall 5% decline in sales of manufactured homes. Installment loans originated or acquired by subsidiaries of Clayton Homes are financed primarily with proceeds from debt issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). In September 2007 and January 2008, BHFC issued an aggregate of $2.75 billion par amount of new notes at interest rates that are on average approximately 72 basis points higher than notes that matured in the second half of 2007 and January 2008. Accordingly, net interest earned from financing activities may decline in 2008. The increase in revenues in 2006 as compared to 2005 from Clayton Homes was primarily attributable to increased sales of manufactured homes of $302 million due to increased sales of higher priced homes as well as an increase in total units sold. Pre-tax earnings from Clayton Homes in 2006 increased $97 million (23%) as compared to 2005 which was due to increased interest income from higher average installment loan balances as a result of loan portfolio acquisitions in 2005. Revenues and pre-tax earnings from furniture/transportation equipment leasing activities for 2007 decreased $70 million (8%) and $71 million (39%), respectively, as compared to 2006. The declines primarily reflect lower rental income driven by lower utilization rates for the over-the-road trailer and storage units. Due to significant cost components of this business being fixed (depreciation and facility expenses), pre-tax earnings declined disproportionately to revenues. Revenues of other finance business activities consist primarily of interest income earned on short-term and other fixed maturity investments. Pre-tax earnings in 2007 reflected a charge of approximately $67 million from the adverse effects of changes in mortality assumptions on certain life annuity contract liabilities. In 2006, pre-tax earnings included income of $67 million from an equity commitment fee and in 2005 pre-tax earnings included losses of $137 million from the General Re derivatives business, which has now completed a major portion of its run-off, and Berkshire’s investment in Value Capital, a partnership interest that was liquidated as of June 30, 2006. Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses follows. Amounts are in millions. 2007 2006 2005 Investment gains/losses from - Sales and other disposals of investments - Insurance and other $ 5,308 $ 1,782 $ 5,831 Finance and financial products 187 6 544 Other-than-temporary impairments — (142 ) (114 ) Other 103 165 (65 ) 5,598 1,811 6,196 Derivative gains/losses from - Foreign currency forward contracts 62 186 (955 ) Other derivative contracts (151 ) 638 253 (89 ) 824 (702 ) Gains/losses before income taxes and minority interests 5,509 2,635 5,494 Income taxes and minority interests 1,930 926 1,964 Net gains/losses $ 3,579 $ 1,709 $ 3,530 Investment gains or losses are recognized upon the sales of investments or as otherwise required under GAAP. The timing of realized gains or losses from sales can have a material effect on periodic earnings. However, such gains or losses usually have little, if any, impact on total shareholders’ equity because most equity and fixed maturity investments are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gain or loss included as a component of other comprehensive income. Other-than-temporary impairments represent the adjustment of cost to fair value when management concludes that an investment’s decline in value below cost is other than temporary. The impairment loss represents a non-cash charge to earnings. 37 Table of Contents Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) In each of the past three years, pre-tax investment gains from sales and other disposals primarily derived from equity securities. In 2005, pre-tax investment gains from sales and other disposals included a non-cash pre-tax gain of approximately $5 billion from Berkshire’s exchange of common stock of The Gillette Company (“Gillette”), which Berkshire held for many years, for shares of The Procter & Gamble Company (“PG”), which PG issued in its acquisition of Gillette. Berkshire’s management does not regard the gain recorded, as required under GAAP, as meaningful. The gain recognized for financial reporting purposes is deferred for income tax purposes. The transaction essentially had no effect on Berkshire’s consolidated shareholders’ equity because the gain was accompanied by a corresponding reduction of unrealized investment gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Derivative gains and losses from foreign currency forward contracts arise as the value of the U.S. dollar changes against certain foreign currencies. The notional value of open foreign currency forward contracts was approximately $14 billion as of December 31, 2005 but has declined to an immaterial amount at December 31, 2007. During 2005, the value of most foreign currencies decreased relative to the U.S. dollar and these contracts produced losses. Other derivative contracts primarily pertain to credit default risks of other U.S. entities as well as equity price risks associated with major worldwide equity indices. Such contracts are carried at estimated fair value and changes in estimated fair value are included in earnings in the period of the change. The gains/losses from such contracts are principally attributable to non-cash changes in the fair values of the related contracts and reflect changes in applicable underlying credit standing, equity index values, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other factors. These contracts generally may not be settled before the expiration date (up to 20 years in the future with respect to equity index contracts) and therefore the amount of cash basis gains or losses will not be known for years. Nevertheless, the fair values on any given reporting date and the resulting gains and losses reflected in earnings will likely be volatile, reflecting the volatility of equity and credit markets. The estimated fair value of equity index and credit default derivative contracts at December 31, 2007 was approximately $6.4 billion, an increase of approximately $3.1 billion from December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to new contracts entered into during the year for which Berkshire received premiums of approximately $2.9 billion. As of December 31, 2007, Berkshire’s maximum exposure under these contracts was approximately $40 billion, an increase of approximately $16 billion from December 31, 2006. Financial Condition Berkshire’s balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2007 was $120.7 billion. Consolidated cash and invested assets, excluding assets of finance and financial products businesses, was approximately $142.4 billion at December 31, 2007 (including cash and cash equivalents of $38.9 billion) and $125.2 billion at December 31, 2006 (including cash and cash equivalents of $38.3 billion). Berkshire’s invested assets are held predominantly in its insurance businesses. A large amount of capital is maintained in the insurance subsidiaries for strategic and marketing purposes and in support of reserves for unpaid losses. In the United States, in particular, dividend payments by insurance companies are subject to prior approval by state regulators. For the year ending December 31, 2007, Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries paid dividends of $4.9 billion. During 2007, Berkshire made several relatively small business acquisitions for aggregate cash consideration of $1.6 billion. Additionally, Berkshire agreed in December 2007 to acquire a 60% interest in Marmon Holdings, Inc. (“Marmon”) for $4.5 billion. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in March 2008. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information concerning the business acquisitions. Berkshire believes that it currently maintains sufficient liquidity to cover its contractual obligations and provide for contingent liquidity. Notes payable and other borrowings of the insurance and other businesses were $2.7 billion (includes about $1.7 billion issued or guaranteed by Berkshire Hathaway Inc.) at December 31, 2007, a decrease of $1 billion from December 31, 2006, reflecting maturities and prepayments of $644 million of parent company debt, reductions in commercial paper (principally NetJets) and repayments of other borrowings of subsidiaries. Berkshire issued 3,715 Class A equivalent shares of common stock during 2007 in connection with the SQUARZ warrant exercises in exchange for $333 million. Capital expenditures of the utilities and energy businesses were approximately $3.5 billion in 2007 and are forecasted to be approximately $3.9 billion in 2008. MidAmerican expects to fund these capital expenditures with cash flows from operations and debt proceeds. Certain of its borrowings are secured by certain assets of its regulated utility subsidiaries. During 2007, MidAmerican issued $3.55 billion par amount of new term debt and repaid $1.57 billion of previously issued debt including net repayments of short-term borrowings. Term debt of MidAmerican maturing in 2008 is $1.97 billion with an additional $3.16 billion due before 2013. Berkshire has committed until February 28, 2011 to provide up to $3.5 billion of additional capital to MidAmerican to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund its regulated utility subsidiaries. Berkshire has not and does not intend to guarantee the repayment of debt by MidAmerican or any of its subsidiaries. Assets of the finance and financial products businesses were $25.7 billion as of December 31, 2007 and $24.6 billion at December 31, 2006, which consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, fixed maturity securities and cash and cash equivalents. Liabilities were $22.0 billion as of December 31, 2007 and $19.4 billion at December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2007, notes payable and other borrowings of $12.1 billion included $8.9 billion par amount of medium-term notes issued by BHFC. In 2007, BHFC issued $750 million par amount of notes due in 2012 and repaid $700 million par amount of notes that matured. In 2008, an additional $3.1 billion par amount of notes will mature, including $1.25 billion that matured in January 2008. BHFC issued an additional $2.0 billion par amount of medium-term notes in January 2008. BHFC notes are unsecured and mature at various dates extending through 2015. The proceeds from these notes are being used to finance originated and 38 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) acquired loans of Clayton Homes, which as of December 31, 2007 had a carrying value of $11 billion. Full and timely payment of principal and interest on the notes issued by BHFC is guaranteed by Berkshire. In addition, Clayton Homes had outstanding borrowings of $1.4 billion which are secured by portfolios of manufactured housing loans and are not guaranteed by Berkshire. These borrowings are repaid as the underlying collateralized loans are repaid. Contractual Obligations Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Notes payable are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements along with accrued but unpaid interest as of the balance sheet date. In addition, Berkshire is obligated to pay interest under debt obligations for periods subsequent to the balance sheet date. Although certain principal balances may be prepaid in advance of the maturity date, thus reducing future interest obligations, it is assumed that no principal prepayments will occur for purposes of this disclosure. Also, short-term borrowings and repurchase agreements are generally expected to be renewed as they mature, however such amounts are not assumed to renew for purposes of this disclosure. Berkshire and subsidiaries are also parties to long-term contracts to acquire goods or services in the future, which are not currently reflected in the financial statements. Such obligations, including future minimum rentals under operating leases, will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date. Contractual obligations for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are estimates. The timing and amount of such payments are contingent upon the ultimate outcome of claim settlements that will occur over many years. The amounts presented in the following table have been estimated based upon past claim settlement activities. The timing and amount of such payments are subject to significant estimation error. The factors affecting the ultimate amount of claims are discussed in the following section regarding Berkshire’s critical accounting policies. In addition, certain losses and loss adjustment expenses for property and casualty loss reserves are ceded to others under reinsurance contracts and therefore are recoverable. Such recoverables are not reflected in the table. Accordingly, the actual timing and amount of payments may differ materially from the amounts shown in the table. A summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 follows. Amounts represent estimates of gross undiscounted amounts payable over time. Amounts are in millions.

Also includes $4.5 billion in 2008 related to the pending acquisition of 60% of Marmon and estimates for the acquisition of the remaining 40% of Marmon between 2011 and 2014. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized in the financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on numerous assumptions involving varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, the amounts currently reflected in the financial statements will likely increase or decrease in the future as additional information becomes available. Property and casualty losses A summary of Berkshire’s consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Except for certain workers’ compensation reserves, liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as “gross unpaid losses”) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value, regardless of the length of the claim-tail. Amounts are in millions. Gross unpaid losses Net unpaid losses* Dec. 31, 2007 Dec. 31, 2006 Dec. 31, 2007 Dec. 31, 2006 GEICO $ 6,642 $ 6,095 $ 6,341 $ 5,814 General Re 19,831 20,444 17,651 18,361 BHRG 24,894 16,832 20,223 14,255 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 4,635 4,241 4,127 3,741 Total $ 56,002 $ 47,612 $ 48,342 $ 42,171 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges reinsurance assumed and before foreign currency translation effects. 39 Table of Contents Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire records liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts with respect to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. Depending on the type of loss, the timing and amount of loss payments are subject to a great degree of variability and are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the determination and payment of the ultimate loss amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used to establish and review the liabilities for unpaid losses recorded as of the balance sheet date. While techniques may vary, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amount payable in the future with respect to loss events that have occurred. As a result, uncertainties are imbedded in and permeate the actuarial loss reserving techniques and processes for all of Berkshire’s property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses. As of any balance sheet date, claims that have occurred have not all been reported and if reported may not have been settled. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include provisions for reported claims (referred to as “case reserves”) and for claims that have not been reported, referred to as incurred but not yet reported (“IBNR”) reserves. The time period between the occurrence date and payment date of a loss is referred to as the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within no more than a few years after occurrence. Casualty losses usually have very long claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal environment which further contributes to the extended claim-tails. Receivables recorded with respect to insurance losses ceded to other reinsurers under reinsurance contracts are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses and, therefore, are also subject to estimation error. In addition to the factors cited above, reinsurance recoverables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders. Each of Berkshire’s insurance businesses utilizes loss reserving techniques that are believed to best fit its business. Additional information regarding reserves established by each of the significant businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows. GEICO GEICO’s gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves as of December 31, 2007 were $6,642 million. As of December 31, 2007, gross reserves included $4,735 million of reported average, case and case development reserves and $1,907 million of IBNR reserves. GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance which has a relatively short claim-tail. The key assumptions affecting GEICO’s reserves include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”), which includes loss adjustment expenses. GEICO’s reserving methodologies produce reserve estimates based upon the individual claims (or a “ground-up” approach), which in the aggregate yields a point estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Ranges of loss estimates are not determined in the aggregate. A detailed discussion of the process and significant factors considered in establishing reserves follows. Actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserves using recognized standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The significant reserve components (and percentage of gross reserves) are: (1) average reserves (20%), (2) case and case development reserves (50%) and (3) IBNR reserves (30%). Each component of loss reserves is affected by the expected frequencies and average severities of claims. Such amounts are analyzed using actuarial techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, rated state, reporting date and occurrence date, among other factors. A brief discussion of each component follows. Average reserve amounts are established for reported auto damage claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. The average reserves are established as a reasonable estimate for incurred claims for which claims adjusters have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that are paid within a relatively short time after being reported. Average reserve amounts are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened. The average severity per claim amount is developed by projecting the ultimate severities for each accident quarter and weighting with both reported claims and estimated unreported claims. Claims adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as soon as the specific facts and merits of each claim can be evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are subsequently revised as more information becomes known. For most liability coverages, case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim-tail, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is established. Therefore, additional case development reserve estimates are established, usually as a percentage of the case reserve. As of December 31, 2007, case development reserves averaged approximately 20% of total established case reserves. In general, case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves. Case development factors are reviewed and revised periodically. 40 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are subtracted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established through the collaborative effort of actuarial, claims and other management. For each of its major coverages, GEICO tests the adequacy of the total loss reserves using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. In 2007, claim frequencies were generally lower than expected and severity increases were generally not as great as originally projected during the first part of the year. Loss reserve estimates recorded at the end of 2006 developed downward by approximately $375 million when reevaluated at December 31, 2007 producing a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2007. These downward reserve developments represented approximately 3% of earned premiums in 2007 and approximately 6% of the prior year-end reserve amount. Reserving assumptions at December 31, 2007 were modified appropriately to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future reserve development will depend on whether frequency and severity turn out to be more or less than anticipated. Within the automobile line of business the reserves with the most uncertainty are for automobile liability, due to the longer claim-tails for most of these coverages. Approximately 90% of GEICO’s reserves as of December 31, 2007 were for automobile liability, of which bodily injury (“BI”) coverage accounted for nearly 60%. Management believes it is reasonably possible that the average BI severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used. If actual BI severity changes one percentage point from what was used in establishing the reserves, the reserves would develop up or down by approximately $99 million resulting in a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to be different from expected would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. GEICO’s exposure to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining reserves associated with such exposure are currently a relatively insignificant component of GEICO’s total reserves (less than 3%) and there is little apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure. Related claim activity over the past year was insignificant. General Re and BHRG General Re’s and BHRG’s property and casualty loss reserves derive primarily from assumed reinsurance. Additional uncertainties unique to loss reserving processes for reinsurance are described below. The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which are affected by market conditions and practices) and other factors. Due to the lack of standardization of the terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts, the wide variability of coverage needs of individual clients and the tendency for those needs to change rapidly in response to market conditions, the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainties, in and of themselves, cannot be reliably measured. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative, per occurrence excess contracts or retroactive contracts where company personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract. Loss information from aggregate excess of loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Occasionally such information is reported in summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is provided through periodic reports and may include the amount of ceded losses paid where reimbursement is sought as well as case loss reserve estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers. Each of Berkshire’s reinsurance businesses has established practices to identify and gather needed information from clients. These practices include, for example, comparison of expected premiums to reported premiums to help identify delinquent client periodic reports and claim reviews to facilitate loss reporting and identify inaccurate or incomplete claim reporting. These practices are periodically evaluated and changed as conditions, risk factors and unanticipated areas of exposures are identified. The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is delayed in comparison with primary insurance. In some instances there are multiple reinsurers assuming and ceding parts of an underlying risk causing multiple contractual intermediaries between General Re or BHRG and the primary insured. In these instances, the delays in reporting can be compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer varies depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms and other factors. Contracts covering casualty losses on a per occurrence excess basis may experience longer delays in reporting due to the length of the claim-tail as regards to the underlying claim. In addition, ceding companies may not report claims to the reinsurer until they believe it is reasonably possible that the reinsurer will be affected, usually determined as a function of its estimate of the claim amount as a percentage of the reinsurance contract retention. On the other hand, the timing of reporting large per occurrence excess property losses or property catastrophe losses may not vary significantly from primary insurance. 41 Table of Contents Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re and BHRG (Continued) Under contracts where periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies, such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals which in the U.S. range from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. In continental Europe, reinsurance reporting practices vary since fewer clients report premiums, losses and case reserves on a quarterly basis. In certain countries, clients report on an annual basis and generally not until 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. Estimates of premiums and losses are accrued based on expected results supplemented when necessary for estimates of significant known events occurring in the interim. To monitor the timing and receipt of information due, client reporting requirements are tracked. When clients miss reporting deadlines, the clients are contacted. Premium and loss data is provided through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a greater risk that the loss data provided is incomplete, inaccurate or outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Reinsurance contracts generally allow for Berkshire’s reinsurance subsidiaries to have access to the cedant’s books and records with respect to the subject business and provide them the ability to conduct audits to determine the accuracy and completeness of information. Such audits are conducted when management deems it appropriate. In the regular course of business, disputes with clients may arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under the reinsurance policies. Most disputes are resolved by the claims departments by discussing coverage aspects with the appropriate client personnel or by independent outside counsel review and determination. If disputes cannot be resolved, contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or alternative dispute resolution will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on Berkshire’s results of operations or financial condition. In summary, the scope, number and potential variability of assumptions required in estimating ultimate losses from reinsurance contracts of General Re and BHRG are more uncertain than primary property and casualty insurers due to the factors previously discussed. Additional information concerning General Re and BHRG follows. General Re General Re’s gross and net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and gross reserves by major line of business as of December 31, 2007 are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Type Reported case reserves $ 10,957 IBNR reserves 8,874 Gross reserves 19,831 Ceded reserves and deferred charges (2,180 ) Net reserves $ 17,651 Line of business Workers’ compensation (1) $ 3,284 Professional liability (2) 1,646 Mass tort-asbestos/environmental 1,841 Auto liability 3,004 Other casualty (3) 4,099 Other general liability 3,127 Property 2,830 Total $ 19,831 (1) Net of discounts of $2,732 million. (2) Includes directors and officers and errors and omissions coverage. (3) Includes medical malpractice and umbrella coverage. General Re’s process of establishing loss reserve estimates is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (“ACRs”) and IBNR reserves. Critical judgments in the establishment of these loss reserves may involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the expectation of ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and the case reserve reporting trends compared to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded reserve amounts are subject to “tail risk” where reported losses develop beyond the maximum expected loss emergence pattern time period. General Re does not routinely determine loss reserve ranges because it believes that the techniques necessary have not sufficiently developed and the myriad of assumptions required render such resulting ranges to be unreliable. In addition, counts of claims or average amounts per claim are not utilized because clients do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail. Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners’ estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners’ estimates are significantly greater than the ceding company’s estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACRs are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2007, ACRs of $3.3 billion before discounts were concentrated in workers’ compensation and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. Examiners also periodically conduct claim reviews at client companies and case reserves are often increased as a result. In 2007, claim examiners conducted about 400 claim reviews. Actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (“reserve cells”) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative and program) and line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, etc.). For each reserve cell, losses are aggregated by accident year and analyzed over time. Depending on client reporting practices, some losses and premiums are aggregated by policy year or underwriting year. These loss aggregations are internally called loss triangles which serve as the primary basis for IBNR reserve calculations. Over 300 reserve cells are reviewed for North American business and approximately 900 reserve cells are reviewed with respect to international business. 42 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) Loss triangles are used to determine the expected case loss emergence patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, are further used to determine IBNR reserves. Additional calculations form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern. The determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly a mechanical process. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, estimation formulas are used along with reliance on other loss triangles and judgment. Factors affecting loss development triangles include but are not limited to the following: changes in client claims practices, changes in claim examiners’ use of ACRs or the frequency of client company claim reviews, changes in policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. These items influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns. Expected loss ratios are selected by reserve cell, by accident year, based upon reviewing forecasted losses and indicated ultimate loss ratios predicted from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premium. If the selected emergence pattern is not accurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios will not be accurate and this can affect the selected loss ratios and hence the IBNR reserve. As with selected loss emergence patterns, selecting expected loss ratios is not a strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing loss ratios. IBNR reserves are estimated by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, actuaries calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year. This calculation does not involve new assumptions and uses the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year. In 2007, for prior years’ workers’ compensation losses, reported claims were less than expected claims by about $74 million. However, further analysis of the workers’ compensation reserve cells by segment indicated the need for additional IBNR. These developments precipitated about $218 million of a net increase in nominal IBNR reserve estimates for unreported occurrences. After deducting $20 million for the change in net reserve discounts during the year, workers’ compensation losses from prior years reduced pre-tax earnings in 2007 by $164 million. To illustrate the sensitivity of changes in expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios for General Re’s significant excess of loss workers’ compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves of approximately $587 million and $334 million on a discounted basis as of December 31, 2007. The increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. Management believes it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates. Other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) were favorable in 2007 relative to expectations. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a year means that loss reserve amounts currently established will continue to develop favorably. For General Re’s significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells (including medical malpractice, umbrella, auto and general liability), an increase of five points in the tails of the expected emergence patterns and an increase of five percent in expected loss ratios (one percent for large international proportional reserve cells) would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $720 million. Management believes it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates in any of the aforementioned individual reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $720 million. Property losses were lower than expected in 2007 but the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses. In response to favorable claim developments and another year of information, estimated remaining World Trade Center losses and estimated losses from the hurricanes in 2005 were reduced by $93 million in 2007. In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (“D&O and E&O”) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected emergence patterns. These cells often involve a spike in loss activity arising from recent industry developments making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern. For example, the number of recent corporate scandals has caused an increase in reported losses. For General Re’s large D&O and E&O reserve cells an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern (for those cells where emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $210 million. Management believes it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates. Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, “mass tort”) claims. Unpaid mass tort reserves at December 31, 2007 were approximately $1.8 billion gross and $1.2 billion net of reinsurance. Such 43 Table of Contents Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) reserves were approximately $1.9 billion gross and $1.2 billion net of reinsurance as of December 31, 2006. Claims paid attributable to such losses were about $75 million in 2007. In 2007, IBNR reserve estimates for asbestos and environmental claims were increased by $48 million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, General Re considers “survival ratios” based on net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. The survival ratio was approximately thirteen years as of December 31, 2007. The insurance industry’s comparable survival ratio for asbestos and pollution reserves was approximately eight years. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. BHRG BHRG’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2007 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions. Property Casualty Total Reported case reserves $ 1,654 $ 2,143 $ 3,797 IBNR reserves 1,180 2,660 3,840 Retroactive — 17,257 17,257 Gross reserves $ 2,834 $ 22,060 24,894 Deferred charges and ceded reserves (4,671 ) Net reserves $ 20,223 In general, the methodologies used to establish loss reserves vary widely and encompass many of the common methodologies employed in the actuarial field today. Certain traditional methodologies such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques are utilized as well as ground-up techniques where appropriate. Additional judgments must also be employed to consider changes in contract conditions and terms as well as the incidence of litigation or legal and regulatory change. As of December 31, 2007, BHRG’s gross loss reserves related to retroactive reinsurance policies were predominantly casualty losses. Retroactive policies include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses (relating to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date) above a contractual retention are indemnified or contracts that indemnify all losses paid by the counterparty after the policy effective date. Retroactive losses paid in 2007 were $894 million. The classification “reported case reserves” has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since the amount is often derived from reports in bulk from ceding companies, who may have inconsistent definitions of “case reserves.” Reserves are reviewed and established in the aggregate by contract including provisions for IBNR reserves. In establishing retroactive reinsurance reserves, historical aggregate loss payment patterns are often analyzed and projected into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. Management assigns judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. Management monitors claim payment activity and reviews ceding company reports or other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, management reassesses expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process. During 2007, retroactive reserves developed downward by approximately $37 million. BHRG’s liabilities for environmental, asbestos, and latent injury losses and loss adjustment expenses are presently concentrated within retroactive reinsurance contracts. Reserves for such losses were approximately $9.7 billion at December 31, 2007 and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase during 2007 was due to the Equitas reinsurance agreement which became effective on March 30, 2007. See Note 11 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Losses paid in 2007 attributable to these exposures were approximately $500 million. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not regularly receive reliable information regarding numbers of asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies on a consistent basis, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess of loss policies. Periodically, a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data of the reinsured is conducted to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, estimates can only be developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. Potential legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on establishing loss reserves for mass tort claims in the future. The maximum losses payable by BHRG under retroactive policies are not expected to exceed approximately $24.8 billion as of December 31, 2007. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, management currently believes it unlikely that unpaid losses as of December 31, 2007 ($17.3 billion) will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15%. A significant number of recent reinsurance contracts are expected to have a low frequency of claim occurrence combined with a potential for high severity of claims. These include property losses from catastrophes, terrorism and aviation risks under catastrophe and individual risk contracts. Loss reserves related to catastrophe and individual risk contracts decreased from approximately $2.2 billion at year end 2006 to approximately $1.3 billion at year end 2007. The decrease in reserves reflected loss payments in 2007 of approximately $900 million that were primarily attributable to the major hurricanes that occurred in 2005. 44 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG (Continued) Loss reserves for pre-2007 events declined by approximately $200 million which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2007. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Catastrophe loss reserves are provided when it is probable that an insured loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event. Other reinsurance reserve amounts are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on an individual contract basis, supplemented by management’s judgment of the impact on each contract of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon management’s judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding company’s loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared. Other Critical Accounting Policies Berkshire records as assets deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the difference between the consideration received and the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss expenses. The deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of loss payments. Adjustments to these assumptions are applied retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were $4.0 billion at December 31, 2007. Significant changes in the estimated amount and payment timing of unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization. Berkshire’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2007 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately $32.9 billion. A significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests. Such tests include periodically determining or reviewing the estimated fair value of Berkshire’s reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then individual assets, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is then charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Berkshire’s consolidated financial position reflects very significant amounts of invested assets. A substantial portion of these assets are carried at fair values based upon current market quotations and, when not available, based upon fair value of similar instruments or valuation models reflecting the present value of estimated future cash flows. Certain of Berkshire’s fixed maturity securities are not actively traded in the financial markets. Further, Berkshire’s finance businesses maintain significant balances of finance receivables, which are carried at amortized cost. Considerable judgment is required in determining the assumptions used in certain valuation models, including interest rate, loan prepayment speed, credit risk and liquidity risk assumptions. Significant changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on carrying values. Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements which are not yet effective is included in Note 1(s) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Berkshire does not expect that the adoption of any of the recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on its financial condition. Market Risk Disclosures Berkshire’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Berkshire’s significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with Berkshire’s business activities. Interest Rate Risk Berkshire’s management prefers to invest in equity securities or to acquire entire businesses based upon the principles discussed in the following section on equity price risk. When unable to do so, management may alternatively invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Berkshire’s strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur. Berkshire strives to maintain high credit ratings so that the cost of debt is minimized. Berkshire utilizes derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks on a limited basis. The fair values of Berkshire’s fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. Fixed interest rate investments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate investments. 45 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk. The hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Berkshire’s management prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Historically, Berkshire’s equity investments are generally concentrated in relatively few investees. At December 31, 2007, 49% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated in four investees. Berkshire’s preferred strategy is to hold equity investments for very long periods of time. Thus, Berkshire’s management is not troubled by short-term equity price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. Berkshire strives to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short-term equity price volatility. The carrying values of investments subject to equity price risk are, in almost all instances, based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet dates. Market prices are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. Furthermore, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold. The table which follows summarizes Berkshire’s equity price risk as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in Berkshire’s equity investment portfolio. Dollars are in millions. Estimated Hypothetical Fair Value after Percentage Hypothetical Hypothetical Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value Price Change Change in Prices Shareholders’ Equity December 31, 2007 $ 74,999 30% increase $ 97,499 12.1 30% decrease 52,499 (12.1 ) December 31, 2006 $ 61,533 30% increase $ 79,993 11.0 30% decrease 43,073 (11.0 ) 46 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Equity Price Risk (Continued) Berkshire is also subject to equity price risk with respect to certain long duration equity index option contracts. Berkshire’s maximum exposure with respect to such contracts was approximately $35 billion and $21 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These contracts generally expire 15 to 20 years from inception and they may not be settled before their respective expiration dates. The contracts have been written on four major equity indexes including three that are based on foreign markets. While Berkshire’s ultimate potential loss with respect to these contracts is directly correlated to the movement of the underlying stock index between contract inception date and expiration, the change in fair value from current changes in the indexes do not produce a proportional change in the estimated fair value of the contracts. Other factors (such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract as well as general market assumptions) affect the estimates of fair value reflected in the financial statements. The carrying amount of these liabilities was $4.6 billion at December 31, 2007 and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2006. If the underlying indexes declined 30% immediately, and absent changes in other factors required to estimate fair value, Berkshire estimates that it could incur a non-cash pre-tax loss of approximately $2.3 billion. Foreign Currency Risk Market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates are currently concentrated in long duration equity index option contracts on foreign equity indexes. The following table summarizes the outstanding derivatives contracts as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 with foreign currency risk and shows the estimated changes in values of the contracts assuming changes in the underlying exchange rates applied immediately and uniformly across all currencies. The changes in value do not necessarily reflect the best or worst case scenarios and actual results may differ. Dollars are in millions.

Exposures include variations in the price of wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold, fuel costs to generate electricity and natural gas supply for regulated retail gas customers. Electricity and natural gas prices are subject to wide price swings as demand responds to, among many other items, changing weather, limited storage, transmission and transportation constraints, and lack of alternative supplies from other areas. To mitigate a portion of the risk, MidAmerican uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other over-the-counter agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Accordingly, the net unrealized gains and losses associated with interim price movements on such contracts are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Financial results may be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel and or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. MidAmerican also uses futures, options and swap agreements to economically hedge gas and electric commodity prices for physical delivery to non-regulated customers. MidAmerican does not engage in a material amount of proprietary trading activities. The table that follows summarizes Berkshire’s commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of MidAmerican as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of that date.

Insurance — Underwriting A summary follows of underwriting results from Berkshire’s insurance businesses for the past three years. Dollars are in millions. 2003 2002 2001 Underwriting gain (loss) attributable to: GEICO $ 452 $ 416 $ 221 General Re 145 (1,393 ) (3,671 ) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 1,047 547 (634 ) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 74 32 30 Underwriting gain (loss) — pre-tax 1,718 (398 ) (4,054 ) Income taxes and minority interest 604 (114 ) (1,400 ) Net underwriting gain (loss) $ 1,114 $ (284 ) $ (2,654 ) Berkshire engages in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks. Through General Re, Berkshire also reinsures life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, Berkshire subsidiaries assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, Berkshire subsidiaries assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Berkshire’s principal insurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, the fifth largest auto insurer in the U.S., (2) General Re, one of the four largest reinsurers in the world, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Berkshire’s management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations – underwriting and investing. Accordingly, Berkshire evaluates performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income. A significant marketing strategy followed by all these businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of Berkshire’s insurance businesses totaled approximately $40.7 billion at December 31, 2003. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet unique needs of sophisticated insurance and reinsurance buyers. Additional information regarding Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance operations follows. GEICO GEICO provides primarily private passenger automobile coverages to insureds in 48 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company over the telephone, through the mail or via the Internet. This is a significant 20 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) element in GEICO’s strategy to be a low cost insurer. In addition, GEICO strives to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICO’s underwriting results for the past three years are summarized below. Dollars are in millions. 2003 2002 2001 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 8,081 $ 6,963 $ 6,176 Premiums earned $ 7,784 100.0 $ 6,670 100.0 $ 6,060 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 5,955 76.5 5,137 77.0 4,842 79.9 Underwriting expenses 1,377 17.7 1,117 16.8 997 16.5 Total losses and expenses 7,332 94.2 6,254 93.8 5,839 96.4 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 452 $ 416 $ 221 Premiums earned in 2003 were $7,784 million, an increase of 16.7% over 2002, following an increase of 10.1% in 2002 over 2001. The growth in premiums earned in 2003 reflects a 10.9% increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force during the past year and average premium rate increases of about two percent. During 2003, policies-in-force increased 8.2% in the preferred risk auto line and 21.4% in the standard and nonstandard auto lines. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2003 increased 20.3% compared to 2002. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2003 were 531,000 higher than at December 31, 2002 and reflect strong growth in the standard and nonstandard lines during the last twelve months. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred increased 15.9% to $5,955 million in 2003, following an increase of 6.1% in 2002 over 2001. The loss ratio for property and casualty insurance, which measures the portion of premiums earned that is paid or reserved for losses and related claims handling expenses, was 76.5% in 2003 compared to 77.0% in 2002 and 79.9% in 2001. Claims frequencies in 2003 for physical damage and bodily injury coverages have decreased in the two to five percent range from 2002 despite more weather related losses in 2003 resulting from winter snowstorms, spring hailstorms and Hurricane Isabel. Bodily injury severity has increased in the six to eight percent range over 2002 while physical damage severity has increased in the two to three percent range. Incurred losses from catastrophe events for 2003 totaled approximately $57 million compared to $20 million in 2002 and $47 million in 2001. Underwriting expenses increased 23.3% to $1,377 million in 2003 over 2002, which follows an increase of 12.0% in 2002 over 2001. Policy acquisition expenses increased 18.7% in 2003 to $731 million reflecting increased advertising and increased staffing to handle the growth in policies-in-force. Other operating expenses were $646 million in 2003, up from $501 million in 2002 and reflect higher salary, profit sharing and other employee benefit expenses. General Re General Re conducts a reinsurance business, which offers reinsurance coverage of essentially all types of property, casualty, life and health risks in the United States and worldwide. General Re’s principal reinsurance operations are internally comprised of: (1) North American property/casualty, (2) international property/casualty, which principally consists of business written through 89% owned Cologne Re, (3) London-market property/casualty through the Faraday operations, and (4) global life/health.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) General Re (Continued) General Re’s consolidated underwriting results in 2003 reflect significant improvements over the past two years and are attributed to rate increases, better coverage terms and the absence of large property losses, partially offset by increases in prior accident years’ loss estimates. Underwriting results in both 2002 and 2001 included significant charges from increases in loss reserve estimates established for claims occurring in prior years. Additionally, underwriting results for 2001 were severely impacted by losses from the September 11th terrorist attack. General Re strives to generate long-term pre-tax underwriting gains in essentially all of its product lines. Underwriting performance is not evaluated based upon market share and underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. Over the past three years, General Re has taken significant underwriting actions to better align premium rates with coverage terms. Information with respect to each of General Re’s underwriting units is presented below. North American property/casualty General Re’s North American property/casualty operations underwrite predominantly excess reinsurance across essentially all lines of property and casualty business. Excess reinsurance provides indemnification of losses above a stated retention on either an individual claim basis or in the aggregate across all claims in a portfolio. Reinsurance contracts are written on both a treaty (group of risks) and facultative (individual risk) basis. Premiums earned in 2003 declined from 2002 premium levels by $416 million (10.5%). The decline in premiums earned reflects a net reduction from cancellations/non-renewals in excess of new contracts (estimated at $761 million), partially offset by rate increases across all lines of business (estimated at $345 million). Premiums earned in 2002 were essentially unchanged compared to 2001 as rate increases (approximately $800 million) across most lines of business were offset by reductions from cancellations in excess of new business. Premiums earned in 2001 included $400 million from one retroactive reinsurance contract and a large quota share agreement. No such contracts were written in 2002 or 2003. The North American property/casualty business produced a pre-tax underwriting gain of $67 million in 2003, compared with losses of $1,019 million and $2,843 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The 2003 underwriting gain consisted of $200 million in current accident year gains, partially offset by $133 million in prior accident year losses. The favorable effects of re-pricing efforts and improved contract terms and conditions implemented over the past three years contributed to the net gain. In addition, underwriting results for 2003 were favorably impacted by the absence of major catastrophes and other large individual property losses ($20 million or greater), a condition that is unusual and should not be expected to occur regularly in the future. The prior accident years’ losses of $133 million recorded in 2003 included $99 million related to discount accretion on workers’ compensation reserves and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance contracts, reserve increases of $153 million for casualty claims, (primarily in the workers’ compensation, directors and officers, and errors and omissions lines), and reserve decreases of $119 million for property claims. For statutory and GAAP reporting purposes workers’ compensation loss reserves are discounted at 1.0% per annum for claims occurring after 2002 and at 4.5% for claims occurring before 2003. The lower discount rate for 2003 claims was approved by General Re’s state insurance regulators and reflects the lower interest rate environment that now exists. The lower discount rate effectively reduced 2003 underwriting gains by approximately $74 million. Underwriting results for 2002 included $1,085 million in prior year loss reserve adjustments, offset by net gains of $66 million with respect to the 2002 accident year. Results for 2002 included $990 million in increased loss estimates related to casualty lines of business (general liability, workers’ compensation, medical malpractice, auto liability and professional liability coverages), principally related to the 1997 through 2000 accident years. The 2002 prior years’ loss reserve adjustment was net of a $115 million reduction in reserves established in connection with the September 11th terrorist attack, primarily due to decreased loss estimates for certain claims. The underwriting loss in 2001 included $923 million in prior years’ loss reserve adjustments, approximately $1.54 billion of net losses from the September 11th terrorist attack, as well as $87 million of losses from other catastrophes (principally Tropical Storm Allison) and other large individual property losses. 22 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) General Re (Continued) Management believes the revised estimates in 2003 on prior years’ casualty loss reserves were primarily due to escalating medical inflation and utilization that adversely affect workers’ compensation and other casualty lines; and an increased frequency in corporate bankruptcies, scandals and accounting restatements which increased losses under errors and omissions and directors and officers coverages. Otherwise, reported casualty losses for prior years were generally consistent with management estimates. In addition to the above listed factors, revised estimates in 2002 and 2001 for prior years’ loss reserves were due to (1) an increase in claim severity, which has a leveraged effect on excess of loss coverages provided by General Re by producing a disproportionate increase in claims exceeding General Re’s attachment point; (2) broadened coverage terms under General Re’s reinsurance contracts during 1997 through 2000; (3) increased ceding companies’ reserve inadequacies, likely arising from broadened terms and conditions, as well as previously unrecognized premium inadequacies; and (4) increased primary company insolvencies, which changed historical claim reporting patterns. See the discussion regarding “Critical Accounting Policies” for information about the processes used in estimating loss reserves. In addition, General Re continuously estimates its liabilities and related reinsurance recoverables for environmental and asbestos claims and claim expenses. Most liabilities for such claims arise from exposures in North America. Environmental and asbestos exposures do not lend themselves to traditional methods of loss development determination and therefore reserves related to these exposures may be considered less reliable than reserves for standard lines of business (e.g., automobile). The estimate for environmental and asbestos losses is composed of four parts: known claims, development on known claims, incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) losses and direct excess coverage litigation expenses. At December 31, 2003, environmental and asbestos loss reserves for North America were $1,050 million ($890 million net of reinsurance). As of December 31, 2002 such amounts totaled $1,161 million ($1,008 million net of reinsurance). The changing legal environment concerning asbestos and environmental claims has made quantification of potential exposures very difficult. Future changes to the legal environment may precipitate significant changes in reserves. Due to the long-tail nature of casualty business, a very high degree of estimation is involved in establishing loss reserves for current accident year casualty occurrences. Thus, the ultimate level of underwriting gain or loss with respect to the 2003 accident year will not be fully known for many years. North American property/casualty loss reserves were $15.5 billion ($14.3 billion net of reinsurance) at December 31, 2003 and $16.2 billion ($14.9 billion net of reinsurance) at December 31, 2002. About 52% of this amount at December 31, 2003 represents estimates of IBNR losses. Although loss reserve levels are now believed to be adequate, there can be no guarantees. A relatively small change in the estimate of net reserves can produce large changes in annual underwriting results. For instance, a one percentage point change in net loss reserves at year end 2003 would produce a pre-tax underwriting gain or loss of $143 million, or roughly 4% of premiums earned in 2003. In addition, the timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual property losses are expected to continue to contribute to volatile periodic underwriting results in the future. International property/casualty The international property/casualty operations write quota-share and excess reinsurance on risks around the world, with its largest markets in Continental Europe and the United Kingdom. International property/casualty business is written on a direct reinsurance basis primarily through Cologne Re. Premiums earned in 2003 increased $105 million (5.9%) from 2002 amounts, reflecting the increase in values of most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. In local currencies, premiums earned declined 8.1% in 2003 versus 2002. The decrease in premiums earned was primarily due to the non-renewal of unprofitable business in Continental Europe, the United Kingdom, Latin America and Australia. In local currencies, premiums earned in 2002 declined 2.1% from 2001, primarily due to a substantial decline in premiums in Argentina, the non-renewal of under-performing business in Continental Europe and parts of Asia, partially offset by increases in the United Kingdom and Australia. The international property/casualty operations produced a pre-tax underwriting gain of $38 million during 2003, compared with pre-tax underwriting losses of $315 million and $568 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively. The net underwriting gain for 2003 included $69 million of gains in the current underwriting year, which reflected rate increases and the absence of large property losses, and losses of $31 million from increases to reserves for prior years’ loss occurrences. Results for 2002 included $240 million of net increases to prior years’ loss reserves, and approximately $107 million in catastrophe and other large individual property losses, principally European flood 23 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) General Re (Continued) losses in August and European storm Jeanette in October. The underwriting loss of $568 million in 2001 included $247 million of net losses related to the September 11th terrorist attack and $143 million resulting from other large individual property losses. At December 31, 2003, the international property/casualty operations had gross loss reserves of $6.4 billion, ($6.0 billion net of reinsurance) compared to $5.4 billion in gross loss reserves at December 31, 2002 ($5.1 billion net of reinsurance). The increase in reserves during 2003 was primarily due to changes in foreign currency rates. The overall economic effect of foreign currency changes were mitigated because foreign denominated liabilities are largely offset by assets denominated in those currencies. Faraday (London-market) London-market business is written through Faraday Holdings Limited (“Faraday”). Faraday owns the managing agent of Syndicate 435 at Lloyd’s of London and provides capacity and participates in the results of Syndicate 435. Through Faraday, General Re’s participation in Syndicate 435 was 100% in 2003. Also included in the London-market segment are Cologne Re’s UK and Continental Europe broker-market subsidiaries. Premiums earned in the London-market operations increased $95 million (11.1%) in 2003 as compared to 2002. Premiums earned in 2002 increased $280 million (48.7%) over 2001 amounts. In local currencies, premiums earned in 2003 were unchanged from 2002 and increased 41.9% in 2002 over 2001. In 2003, premiums earned from Cologne Re’s Continental Europe broker-market subsidiary, which was placed in run-off, declined but were offset by increases in earned premiums in Faraday Syndicate 435. Premiums earned in 2002 increased primarily due to the increased participation in Faraday Syndicate 435 from 60.6% in 2001 to 96.7% in 2002. London-market operations produced a pre-tax underwriting loss of $18 million in 2003, compared with pre-tax underwriting losses of $4 million and $178 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The underwriting loss in 2003 included $73 million of reserve increases related to prior years’ loss events. These losses occurred primarily in casualty lines. In 2003, underwriting gains were earned in property and aviation lines, reflecting more selective underwriting and a lack of catastrophes and other large losses. Underwriting results in 2002 were adversely impacted by $80 million of increases in prior years’ casualty loss reserve estimates and $17 million of European flood losses. Offsetting these amounts were gains in property business. The London-market underwriting loss in 2001 included $66 million of losses from the September 11th terrorist attack as well as relatively high property losses. At December 31, 2003, the Faraday operations had gross loss reserves of $1.9 billion, ($1.7 billion net of reinsurance) compared to $1.7 billion in gross reserves at December 31, 2002 ($1.3 billion net of reinsurance). The increase in reserves during 2003 was primarily due to changes in foreign currency rates. Global life/health General Re’s global life/health affiliates reinsure such risks worldwide. Premiums earned in 2003 decreased by $39 million (2.1%) compared with 2002. Premiums earned in 2002 for the global life/health operations declined $102 million (5.1%) from 2001. Adjusting for the effects of foreign currency exchange, premiums earned declined 9.6% in 2003, and 6.7% in 2002. The decline in 2003 was primarily due to decreases in the group and individual health businesses in the U.S. life/health operations. Underwriting results for the global life/health operations produced a pre-tax underwriting gain of $58 million in 2003, compared with underwriting losses of $55 million and $82 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. While both the U.S. and international life/health segments were profitable in 2003, most of the gains were earned in the international life segment. The underwriting losses for 2002 and 2001 were principally due to increased reserves on run-off business in the U.S. life/health operations. Underwriting results for 2001 also include $19 million of net losses related to the September 11th terrorist attack. 24 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) underwrites excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages for insurers and reinsurers around the world. BHRG is believed to be one of the leaders in providing catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and writing coverages for large or otherwise unusual discrete commercial property risks on a direct and facultative reinsurance basis, referred to as individual risk business. BHRG’s underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Catastrophe and individual risk $ 1,330 $ 1,283 $ 553 $ 1,108 $ 1,006 $ (150 ) Retroactive reinsurance 526 407 1,993 (387 ) (433 ) (358 ) Traditional multi-line 2,574 1,610 445 326 (26 ) (126 ) Total $ 4,430 $ 3,300 $ 2,991 $ 1,047 $ 547 $ (634 ) During the second half of 2001, opportunities for BHRG to write catastrophe and individual risk business increased significantly, particularly subsequent to September 11th. Contracts written may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification, often several hundred million dollars and occasionally in excess of $1 billion, and may cover catastrophe risks (such as hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters) or other property risks (such as aviation and aerospace, commercial multi-peril or terrorism). Catastrophe and individual business written totaled about $1.2 billion in 2003 and $1.5 billion in 2002. The level of business written in future periods will vary, perhaps materially, based upon market conditions and management’s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. The catastrophe and individual risk business produced substantial underwriting gains in 2003 and 2002 due to the lack of catastrophic or otherwise large loss events. The net underwriting loss in 2001 included about $410 million from the September 11th terrorist attack. Losses related to the September 11th terrorist attack were reduced by about $85 million in 2002, as payments to settle claims under certain policies were below original estimates. Although very large underwriting gains were achieved in 2003 and 2002, a single loss event could have easily eliminated those gains. The pre-tax maximum probable loss from a single event at December 31, 2003 is estimated to be approximately $6.7 billion resulting from potential risk of loss from a major earthquake in California. BHRG, as a matter of general practice, does not cede catastrophe and individual risks to other reinsurers due to the uncertainty of collecting recoverable losses ceded to financially weaker companies if a natural or financial mega-catastrophe should occur. Underwriting results of this business will remain subject to extreme volatility. Nevertheless, Berkshire’s management remains willing to accept such volatility provided there is a reasonable prospect of long-term underwriting profitability. Retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify ceding companies for losses arising under insurance or reinsurance contracts written in the past, usually many years ago. While contract terms vary, losses under the contracts are subject to a very large aggregate dollar limit, occasionally exceeding $1 billion under a single contract. Generally, it is also anticipated, although not assured, that claims under retroactive contracts will be paid over long time periods. These contracts do not produce an immediate underwriting loss for financial reporting purposes. The excess of the estimated ultimate claims payable over the premiums received is established as a deferred charge which is subsequently amortized over the expected claim settlement periods. Such amortization is included as a component of losses incurred and essentially represents the net underwriting losses from this business in each of the past three years. In addition, underwriting results in 2003 included a net gain of $41 million from the commutation of contracts written in prior years in exchange for commutation payments of $710 million. Retroactive reinsurance contracts are expected to generate significant underwriting losses over time due to the amortization of deferred charges. This business is accepted due to the exceptionally large amounts of float generated, which totaled about $7.7 billion at December 31, 2003. Unamortized deferred charges under BHRG retroactive reinsurance contracts were $2.8 billion at December 31, 2003 and $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2002. During the last two years, BHRG wrote a significant amount of business under traditional multi-line contracts. Such contracts included several quota-share participations in, and contracts with, Lloyd’s syndicates and a quota-share contract written in 2002 with a major U.S. based insurer, which was cancelled in 2003. These contracts and participations generated written premiums of about $1.6 billion in 2003 and $2.0 billion in 2002. In a quota- 25 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance — Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) share arrangement, BHRG essentially participates proportionately in the premiums and claims of the business written by the ceding company. BHRG was willing to enter into these new contracts because it believed the level of rate adequacy in certain property/casualty markets was much improved in relation to past years. BHRG’s participation in the Lloyd’s business declined in 2003 as the availability of other sources of capacity for Lloyd’s syndicates increased. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group Berkshire’s primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of smaller insurance businesses that principally write liability coverages for commercial accounts. These businesses include: National Indemnity Company’s primary group operation (“NICO Primary Group”), a writer of motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation (“USIC”), whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as “Homestate” operations, providers of standard multi-line insurance; and Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions. Collectively, Berkshire’s other primary insurance businesses produced earned premiums of $1,034 million in 2003, $712 million in 2002, and $501 million in 2001. The increases in premiums earned during the past two years were largely attributed to increased volume at USIC and the NICO Primary Group. Net underwriting gains of Berkshire’s other primary insurance businesses totaled $74 million in 2003, $32 million in 2002, and $30 million in 2001. The improvement in year-to-year comparative underwriting results was due to the aforementioned increases in premiums and reasonably good claim experience. Insurance — Investment Income Following is a summary of the net investment income of Berkshire’s insurance operations for the past three years. Dollars are in millions. 2003 2002 2001 Investment income before taxes $ 3,223 $ 3,050 $ 2,824 Applicable income taxes and minority interest 947 954 856 Investment income after taxes and minority interest $ 2,276 $ 2,096 $ 1,968 Investment income from insurance operations in 2003 of $3,223 million increased 5.7% over 2002, which exceeded 2001 by 8.0%. The increase in 2003 investment income was due primarily to higher amounts of interest earned from high-yield corporate obligations, partially offset by the effects of lower interest rates for other fixed maturity obligations. Berkshire’s investments in high-yield corporate bonds were approximately $8 billion (at original cost) as of December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2003 the cost of such investments declined about $1.5 billion, as a result of sales and prepayments by issuers. The high-yield investments were primarily acquired at distressed prices. The credit risk associated with such investments is much greater than with other fixed maturity investments typically acquired by Berkshire, which are generally U.S. Government, municipal and mortgage-backed securities and short-term cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 65% of Berkshire’s high-yield investments were issued by companies in the energy industry. While the market prices of such investments increased significantly for all major positions during 2003, Berkshire management does not believe that the credit risks associated with the issuers of these instruments has correspondingly declined. Credit losses may eventually occur with respect to some of these investments. However, management also believes that over time these investments will produce reasonable returns in relation to credit risk. Invested assets of insurance businesses increased during 2003 by $14.5 billion to $93.5 billion at December 31, 2003 following an increase of $7 billion during 2002. The increase in invested assets during 2003 was primarily the result of the market price appreciation of Berkshire’s major equity investments and high-yield fixed maturity investments, as well as strong operating cash flow. Float represents an estimate of the amount of funds ultimately payable to policyholders that is available for investment. Total float at December 31, 2003 was approximately $44.2 billion compared to $41.2 billion at December 31, 2002 and about $35.5 billion at December 31, 2001. The cost of float, represented by the ratio of the pre-tax underwriting gain or loss over average float, was negative for 2003 due to $1.7 billion of pre-tax net underwriting gains. The cost of float in 2002 was about 1.1% as compared to 12.8% for 2001. 26 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Non-Insurance Businesses Since December 31, 2000, Berkshire’s numerous non-insurance business activities have increased significantly through several business acquisitions. Additional information regarding these acquisitions is contained in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A summary follows of results from Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses for the past three years. Dollars are in millions. 2003 2002 2001 Pre-tax earnings $ 2,776 $ 2,667 $ 1,803 Income taxes and minority interest 1,031 999 721 Net earnings $ 1,745 $ 1,668 $ 1,082 A comparison of revenues and pre-tax earnings between 2003, 2002 and 2001 for the non-insurance businesses follows. Dollars are in millions. Revenues Pre-tax earnings (loss) 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Apparel $ 2,075 $ 1,619 $ 726 $ 289 $ 229 $ (33 ) Building products 3,846 3,702 3,269 559 516 461 Finance and financial products 3,073 2,234 1,928 619 726 402 Flight services 2,431 2,837 2,563 72 225 186 McLane 13,743 — — 150 — — Retail 2,311 2,103 1,998 165 166 175 Shaw Industries 4,660 4,334 4,012 436 424 292 Other businesses 3,040 2,375 1,957 486 381 320 $ 35,179 $ 19,204 $ 16,453 $ 2,776 $ 2,667 $ 1,803 Apparel Berkshire’s apparel manufacturing and distribution businesses have grown significantly during the last two years as a result of the acquisitions of Fruit of the Loom on April 30, 2002 and Garan on September 4, 2002. During 2003 these two businesses generated combined revenues of $1,459 million and pre-tax earnings of $260 million. From their respective acquisition dates, these two businesses generated combined revenues of $957 million and pre-tax earnings of $190 million in 2002. On a comparative full year basis, total apparel group revenues in 2003 declined 5% from 2002 and pre-tax earnings in 2003 declined 11% as compared to 2002. Pre-tax losses in 2001 from the apparel businesses included operating losses and a restructuring charge at Dexter. Building products Each of Berkshire’s building products businesses manufactures and distributes products and services for the residential and commercial construction and home improvement markets. Revenues of the building products group totaled $3,846 million in 2003 compared to $3,702 million in 2002. Each of the building products businesses generated higher revenues in 2003 as compared to 2002 and benefited from the strong housing market and relatively low interest rates. Pre-tax earnings of the building products businesses in 2003 were $559 million compared to $516 million in 2002. Finance and financial products A variety of finance and financial products businesses are included in this segment. These businesses invest in various types of fixed-income securities (BH Finance), make commercial loans (Berkshire Hathaway Credit Corporation and Berkadia LLC), issue and service installment loan contracts with respect to manufactured housing (Clayton Homes, through its subsidiary Vanderbilt Mortgage, acquired August 7, 2003), lease trailers and shipping containers used in product transportation and lease furniture (XTRA and CORT) and offer for sale annuities and similar type products (Berkshire Hathaway Life). This group also includes General Re Securities (“GRS”), a dealer in derivative contracts. These businesses generally issue debt or interest bearing obligations to finance asset acquisitions. 27 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Non-Insurance Businesses (Continued) Finance and financial products (Continued) Revenues of the finance group consist of interest, rentals, and sales of manufactured homes, transportation equipment and furniture. Revenues in 2003 totaled $3,073 million, an increase of 37.6% over 2002. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to the inclusion of Clayton (approximately $500 million), revenues from the issuance of annuity products of approximately $700 million versus none in 2002 and was partially offset by lower interest income. Pre-tax earnings of the finance group in 2003, which exclude realized investment gains, declined $107 million (14.7%) from 2002. Much of the comparative decline in pre-tax earnings was due to lower net interest earned by BH Finance. BH Finance’s fixed maturity investment portfolio declined about $6 billion during 2003 as a result of sales and prepayments and was offset by corresponding declines in repurchase agreement obligations. During 2003, pre-tax earnings included about $101 million from Berkadia as compared to $115 million in 2002. Earnings of Berkadia are directly correlated with the outstanding amount of a term loan to FINOVA, which totaled $525 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $2.175 billion at December 31, 2002 and $4.9 billion at December 31, 2001. Most of Berkadia’s pre-tax earnings in 2003 were represented by the accelerated recognition in earnings of fees received in 2001 from FINOVA in connection with origination of the loan as a result of loan repayments being at a much faster rate than originally anticipated. In February 2004, the FINOVA loan was repaid in full. Thus, earnings from Berkadia in 2004 will be nominal. GRS had a pre-tax loss in 2003 of $99 million versus a loss of $173 million in 2002. GRS’s operation has been in run-off since January 2002. During the run-off period, GRS has limited new business to certain risk management transactions and is unwinding existing asset and liability positions in an orderly manner. Since the run-off commenced, approximately two-thirds of GRS’s open trades have been terminated. It is expected that the run-off will take at least several more years to complete. The pre-tax losses in the last two years reflect related run-off costs as well as net transaction and position losses. Additional losses will almost certainly be incurred over time in connection with the run-off. The timing and amounts of such losses is uncertain. Flight services This segment includes FlightSafety, a leading provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft and ships and NetJets, the world’s leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft. FlightSafety’s worldwide clients include corporations, regional airlines, the military and government agencies. The decline in revenues was split between FlightSafety (about $96 million) and NetJets (about $310 million). A decline in FlightSafety training revenues accounted for most of that businesses revenue decline. The decline in training revenues was due to a decline in regional airline training somewhat offset by increased U.S. Government training revenues. The decline in revenues at NetJets was due to a reduction of revenues from sales of aircraft of $514 million partially offset by increased flight services and other revenues of about $204 million. Pre-tax earnings from these businesses was $72 million in 2003 as compared to $225 million in 2002. The results for 2002 include a gain of $60 million from the sale of a partnership interest to Boeing and the results for 2003 include the recognition of pre-tax charges of $69 million related to write downs of certain simulators and aircraft inventory. Excluding the aforementioned gain and write downs, “normal earnings” from these businesses were $141 million in 2003 versus $165 million in 2002. The reduction in combined “normal” pre-tax earnings from these businesses is due to reduced “normal” pre-tax earnings at FlightSafety of $34 million somewhat offset by improved results at NetJets where its pre-tax loss before write downs was $9 million in 2003 versus about $19 million in 2002. The corporate aviation business has slowed significantly in the past few years which has hurt FlightSafety’s results. NetJets continues to be the leader in the fractional ownership field. McLane On May 23, 2003, Berkshire acquired McLane Company, Inc. from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Results of McLane’s business operations are included in Berkshire’s consolidated results beginning on that date. McLane’s revenues were $13,743 million and pre-tax earnings totaled $150 million for the period from May 23 to December 31. Approximately 35% of McLane’s revenues derived from sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. McLane’s business is marked by high sales volume and low profit margins. For its most recently completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, McLane’s sales and pre-tax earnings totaled approximately $21.9 billion and $220 million, respectively. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the acquisition and McLane’s business. 28 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Non-Insurance Businesses (Continued) Retail Berkshire’s retailing businesses consist of four independently managed retailers of home furnishings (Nebraska Furniture Mart and its subsidiaries (“NFM”), R.C. Willey Home Furnishings (“R.C. Willey”), Star Furniture (“Star”) and Jordan’s Furniture) and three independently managed retailers of fine jewelry (Borsheim’s Jewelry, Helzberg’s Diamond Shops (“Helzberg”), and Ben Bridge Jeweler). Revenues of the retail businesses in 2003 increased $208 million (9.9%) as compared to 2002, and 2002 revenues increased 5.3% over 2001. The increase in revenues in 2003 was primarily attributed to Nebraska Furniture Mart’s new store in Kansas City, Kansas, which opened in August 2003 and R.C. Willey’s second Nevada location, which opened in May 2003. Comparative pre-tax earnings of the retail group in 2003 were relatively unchanged from 2002. Higher earnings associated with the new R.C. Willey store were offset by start-up and depreciation costs incurred in connection with NFM’s new store. Shaw Industries Shaw is a leading manufacturer and distributor of carpet and rugs for residential and commercial use. Shaw also provides installation services and offers hardwood floor and other floor coverings. Berkshire acquired 87.3% of the common stock of Shaw in January 2001 and the remainder of the outstanding stock in January 2002. Shaw’s revenues in 2003 of $4,660 million increased by $326 million (7.5%) over 2002, and 2002 revenues increased 8.0% over 2001. The increase in 2003 revenues reflects a 6.1% increase in carpet sales revenues as well as increased sales of hard floor surfaces. Shaw’s revenues in 2003 also include the results from Dixie Group, a carpet and rug manufacturer acquired in November. In 2003, Shaw’s pre-tax earnings totaled $436 million, an increase of $12 million (2.8%) over 2002. Shaw’s operating results in 2003 benefited from increased sales and lower borrowing costs. Other businesses Revenues in 2003 from Berkshire’s other businesses as compared to 2002 increased $665 million to $3,040 million and pre-tax earnings increased $105 million to $486 million. Berkshire’s other non-insurance businesses consist of the results of numerous smaller businesses. The increase in revenues and pre-tax earnings of other businesses in 2003 was primarily due to the inclusion of the results of businesses acquired in 2002 from their respective acquisition dates (Larson-Juhl—February 8, 2002, The Pampered Chef and CTB International—both October 31, 2002). Equity in earnings of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company Earnings from MidAmerican represent Berkshire’s share of MidAmerican’s net earnings, as determined under the equity method. Earnings from MidAmerican totaled $429 million in 2003, $359 million in 2002 and $134 million in 2001. MidAmerican’s earnings increased in 2003 due to improved results in its utility businesses, the effects of the acquisition during 2002 and the subsequent expansion during 2003 of two natural gas pipelines and increased earnings from its real estate brokerage business due to acquisitions and increased transaction volume. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Berkshire’s investments in MidAmerican. Purchase-Accounting Adjustments Purchase-accounting adjustments reflect the after-tax effect on net earnings with respect to the amortization of fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities recorded at various business acquisition dates. Prior to 2002, this amount also included goodwill amortization. Effective January 1, 2002, Berkshire ceased amortizing goodwill of previously acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Realized Investment Gains Realized investment gains and losses have been a recurring element in Berkshire’s net earnings for many years. Such amounts are recorded when investments are: (1) sold or disposed; (2) impaired; or (3) marked-to-market with a corresponding gain or loss included in earnings. Such amounts also include realized and unrealized gains or losses associated with certain derivatives contracts. Realized investment gains may fluctuate significantly from period to period, resulting in a meaningful effect on reported net earnings. However, the amount of realized gains in a given period has no practical analytical value, given the magnitude of unrealized gains existing in Berkshire’s consolidated investment portfolio. 29 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Realized Investment Gains (Continued) The Consolidated Statements of Earnings include after-tax realized investment gains of $2,729 million in 2003, $566 million in 2002 and $923 million in 2001. These gains were net of after-tax losses of $188 million in 2003, $373 million in 2002 and $161 million in 2001 related to “other-than-temporary” impairments. Management evaluates investments for impairment as of each balance sheet date. Factors considered in determining whether an impairment charge is warranted include the length of time the unrealized loss has existed, the financial condition of the investee, future business prospects and creditworthiness of the investee, and Berkshire’s ability and intent to hold the investment until the value recovers. When an impairment charge is recorded, the cost of the investment is written down to fair value through a charge to earnings. Consequently, impairment charges from essentially all of Berkshire’s “other-than-temporarily” impaired investments produced little effect on total shareholders’ equity because these investments were already carried at fair value with the difference between fair value and cost included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. After-tax realized gains also included $536 million in 2003 and $193 million in 2002 of realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency forward contracts entered into during the last two years. After-tax unrealized gains included in earnings with respect to open contracts totaled $414 million as of December 31, 2003 and $193 million at December 31, 2002. The gains in each year were due primarily to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies. Financial Condition Berkshire’s balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2003 totaled $77.6 billion. Consolidated cash and invested assets, excluding assets of finance and financial products businesses, totaled approximately $95.6 billion at December 31, 2003, (including $31.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents) and totaled $80.5 billion at December 31, 2002. During 2003, the market prices of Berkshire’s holdings in equity and fixed maturity securities increased significantly and cash flow generated from operations was about $8.2 billion. During 2003, Berkshire deployed about $3.2 billion in internally generated cash for business acquisitions and during the preceding two years, cash of $7.3 billion was utilized in business acquisitions, and $1.7 billion was utilized for additional investments in MidAmerican. Berkshire’s consolidated notes payable and other borrowings, excluding borrowings of finance businesses, totaled $4.2 billion at December 31, 2003 and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2002. During 2003, commercial paper and short-term borrowings of subsidiaries declined $642 million from prepayments arising from strong operating cash flow at Shaw and utilization of excess cash by General Re. Other borrowings consist primarily of debt of subsidiaries and investment contracts issued by Berkshire. In May 2002, Berkshire issued the SQUARZ securities, which consist of $400 million par amount of senior notes due in November 2007 together with warrants to purchase 4,464 Class A equivalent shares of Berkshire common stock, which expire in May 2007. A warrant premium is payable to Berkshire at an annual rate of 3.75% and interest is payable to note holders at a rate of 3.00%. Each warrant provides the holder the right to purchase either 0.1116 shares of Class A or 3.348 shares of Class B stock for $10,000. In addition, holders of the senior notes have the option to require Berkshire to repurchase the senior notes at par annually each May 15 from 2004 through 2006, provided that the holders also surrender a corresponding amount of warrants for cancellation. All warrants and senior notes were outstanding as of December 31, 2003. Assets of the finance and financial products businesses totaled $28.3 billion at December 31, 2003 and $34.1 billion at December 31, 2002. The overall decline reflects a $6 billion decline in assets of BH Finance as a result of the liquidation of certain fixed income investments, FINOVA loan prepayments totaling $1.65 billion and a decline in assets of GRS, which is in run-off. The outstanding loan to FINOVA as of December 31, 2003 and corresponding borrowing from Fleet (each $525 million) were fully repaid in February 2004. As of December 31, 2003, finance assets included approximately $3.8 billion in assets of Clayton, which was acquired by Berkshire in August 2003. Clayton is a leading builder of manufactured housing, provides financing and services loans to customers, and acquires other installment loan portfolios. Prior to its acquisition, Clayton securitized and sold a significant portion of its installment loans through special purpose entities. In early 2003, Clayton discontinued loan securitizations and sales. Since being acquired by Berkshire, Clayton retained loan portfolios have increased by about $1.3 billion. Loan portfolios are expected to continue to grow over time. Notes payable and other borrowings of Berkshire’s finance and financial products businesses totaled $4.9 billion at December 31, 2003 and $4.5 billion at December 31, 2002. During the last four months of 2003, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation issued a total of $2.0 billion par amount of medium term notes due from 30 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition (Continued) 2008 through 2013. The proceeds of these issues were used to finance new and existing loans of Clayton. The medium term notes are guaranteed by Berkshire. Additional borrowings are expected in the future as retained loan portfolios continue to increase. Berkshire believes that it currently maintains sufficient liquidity to cover its existing requirements and provide for contingent liquidity. Contractual Obligations Berkshire and its subsidiaries have contractual obligations associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments in future periods. Certain of those obligations, such as notes payable and other borrowings and related interest payments, are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, Berkshire and subsidiaries have entered into long-term contracts to acquire goods or services in the future, which are not currently reflected in the financial statements and will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. A summary of contractual obligations follows. Amounts are in millions. Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total 2004 2005-2006 2007-2008 2009 and after Notes payable and other borrowings (1) $ 12,107 $ 3,225 $ 1,015 $ 2,104 $ 5,763 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (1) 7,958 7,958 — — — Operating leases 1,508 322 505 334 347 Purchase obligations (2) 6,842 2,561 1,808 1,418 1,055 Other (3) 924 202 173 125 424 Total $ 29,339 $ 14,268 $ 3,501 $ 3,981 $ 7,589 (1) Includes interest (2) Principally relates to NetJets aircraft purchases (3) Principally employee benefits and deferred compensation Critical Accounting Policies In applying certain accounting policies, Berkshire’s management is required to make estimates and judgments regarding transactions that have occurred and ultimately will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized in the financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on assumptions about numerous factors involving varying, and possibly significant, degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, the amounts currently recorded in the financial statements may prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be inaccurate. The balance sheet items most significantly affected by these estimates are property and casualty insurance and reinsurance related liabilities. Berkshire records liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts related to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. Berkshire uses a variety of techniques to establish and review the liabilities for unpaid losses recorded as of the balance sheet date. While techniques may vary, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amount payable in the future with respect to loss events that have occurred as of the balance sheet date. Reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are established by policy type (or line) or individual coverage within the policy type. Reserves may consist of individual case estimates, supplemental case estimates, development estimates and incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claim estimates. Once reported, certain casualty claims may take years to settle, especially if legal action is involved. Liabilities may also reflect implicit or explicit assumptions regarding the potential effects of future economic and social inflation, judicial decisions, law changes, and recent trends in such factors. Berkshire uses a variety of techniques as tools in establishing and evaluating aggregate reserve amounts. Techniques used vary within each business depending upon the availability of reliable information. Statistical techniques may include detailed analysis of historical amounts of losses incurred or paid, claim frequency and severity data, average paid or incurred loss data, closed claim data, paid or incurred loss ratios or other measurements. Statistical techniques are more reliable when a sufficient volume of historical loss information exists. Significant changes to policy terms or coverages or in volumes of business written (and, therefore, loss exposures), or changes in the insurance laws or legal environment can cause historical statistical data to be less reliable in projecting the ultimate amount of losses as of the balance sheet date. Statistical analysis may be based 31 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) upon internally developed loss experience, the experience of individual clients or groups of clients, or overall industry-wide experience. Reserving techniques are based more upon informed judgment when statistical data is insufficient or unavailable. Management must make judgments regardless of the techniques used. As of any balance sheet date, all claims that have occurred have not yet been reported to Berkshire, and if reported may not have been settled. The time period between the occurrence of a loss and the time it is settled by the insurer or reinsurer is referred to as the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have a fairly short claim-tail and, absent claim litigation, are reported and settled within no more than a few years of the balance sheet date. Casualty losses, on the other hand, can have a very long claim-tail, occasionally extending for decades. In addition, casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and to the legal environment, which contributes to the extended claim-tail. The claim-tail for reinsurers is further extended due to delayed reporting by ceding insurers or reinsurers due to contractual provisions or reporting practices. The process of establishing reserves for losses assumed under reinsurance contracts requires additional estimation and judgments by management. Loss reserve estimates are based primarily on claims reported by ceding companies (such amounts generally exclude IBNR claim estimates), analysis of historical claim reporting patterns of ceding companies, and estimates of expected overall loss amounts. Techniques for estimating facultative (or individual) reinsurance losses can be similar to those techniques used by primary insurers and subject to the same caveats. In estimating losses assumed under treaty reinsurance (groups of losses), claim frequency or count analyses may not be used because such data is either not provided by ceding companies or otherwise not timely or reliable. Loss reserves established by line of business and type of coverage are regularly re-evaluated with appropriate adjustments being made to bring reserves in line with the revised estimates. IBNR reserves are largely comprised of casualty exposures, which include workers’ compensation losses. These claims tend to be reported by and settled with ceding companies over long time periods. Therefore, such claims are subject to a higher degree of estimation error as a result of changes in the legal environment, jury awards, medical cost trends and general cost inflation. Based upon statistical analysis of past reporting trends, Berkshire estimates how much IBNR is required to cover claims that will be reported by ceding companies in future years. Subsequently, as claims are reported, amounts are measured against previous expectations, with variances (positive or negative) recognized in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. Significant variances between expected claims and reported claims are analyzed and considered when revising estimates for remaining IBNR reserve levels. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes and judgments used in establishing reserves, and because expected losses are an input in establishing premium rates for new policies, Berkshire’s management believes it is appropriate to establish reserve levels using a reasonable level of caution, especially with respect to casualty claims. Receivables recorded with respect to insurance losses ceded to other reinsurers under reinsurance contracts are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses and, therefore, are also subject to estimation error. In addition to the factors cited above, reinsurance recoverables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders. A summary of Berkshire’s consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses are in the table below. The amount of losses recorded in each of the past two years relating to prior years’ loss occurrences is expressed as a percentage of total net premiums earned as well as a percentage of the net reserve balance established as of the beginning of the year. Dollars are in millions. Unpaid losses Net unpaid losses* Dec.31, 2003 Dec.31, 2002 Dec.31, 2003 Dec.31, 2002 General Re $ 23,820 $ 23,326 $ 20,787 $ 20,784 BHRG 15,769 15,516 12,513 11,990 GEICO 4,492 4,010 4,282 3,816 Berkshire Hathaway Primary 1,312 919 1,217 834 Total $ 45,393 $ 43,771 $ 38,799 $ 37,424 Losses incurred related to prior years $ 480 ** $ 1,540 ** Losses as a % of net reserves beginning of the year 1.3 % 4.5 % Losses as a % of net premiums earned current year 2.4 % 8.9 % * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges reinsurance assumed. ** Includes amortization of deferred charges and includes accretion of discounts on General Re workers’ compensation reserves (See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 32 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) In each year, General Re’s casualty reserve estimates for prior years’ losses have increased. In addition, the net reserves of BHRG’s retroactive reinsurance policies have increased each year, primarily as a consequence of amortization of deferred charges. As shown in the table, a relatively small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude will result in a material effect on reported earnings. A hypothetical 5% increase in estimated net unpaid losses at December 31, 2003, would produce a $1.9 billion charge to pre-tax earnings. Future effects from changes in these estimates will be recorded as a component of losses incurred in the period of the change. Berkshire records deferred charges as assets on its balance sheet with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts the deferred charges represent the difference between the consideration received and the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses. The deferred charges are amortized as a component of losses incurred using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period. The deferred charge balance may be adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of loss payments. Adjustments to these assumptions are applied retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges totaled $3.1 billion at December 31, 2003. Significant changes in either the timing or ultimate amount of loss payments may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization. Berkshire’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately $22.9 billion. These amounts have been recorded as a result of Berkshire’s numerous prior business acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method. Prior to 2002, goodwill from each acquisition was generally amortized as a charge to earnings over periods not exceeding 40 years. Under SFAS No. 142, which was adopted by Berkshire as of January 1, 2002, periodic amortization ceased, in favor of an impairment-only accounting model. A significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests. Such tests include periodically determining or reviewing the estimated fair value of Berkshire’s reporting units. Under SFAS No. 142, fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit may be bought or sold. There are several methods of estimating reporting unit values, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then individual assets, including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is then charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Berkshire’s consolidated financial position reflects large amounts of invested assets, including assets of its finance and financial products businesses. A substantial portion of these assets are carried at fair values based upon current market quotations and, when not available, based upon fair value pricing models. Certain fixed maturity securities Berkshire owns are not actively traded in the markets. Further, Berkshire’s finance businesses maintain significant balances of finance receivables, which are carried at amortized cost. Considerable judgment is required in determining the assumptions used in certain pricing models, including interest rate, loan prepayment speed, credit risk and liquidity risk assumptions. Significant changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on carrying values. Market Risk Disclosures Berkshire’s Consolidated Balance Sheet includes a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Berkshire’s significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity prices and to a lesser degree derivatives. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with Berkshire’s business activities. 33 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures (Continued) Interest Rate Risk Berkshire’s management prefers to invest in equity securities or to acquire entire businesses based upon the principles discussed in the following section on equity price risk. When unable to do so, management may alternatively invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Berkshire’s strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur. Berkshire has historically utilized a modest level of corporate borrowings and debt. Further, Berkshire strives to maintain the highest credit ratings so that the cost of debt is minimized. Berkshire utilizes derivative products to manage interest rate risks to a very limited degree. The fair values of Berkshire’s fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. Fixed interest rate investments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate investments. The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks. The hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Equity Price Risk Strategically, Berkshire strives to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices. Berkshire’s management prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Accordingly, Berkshire’s equity investments are concentrated in relatively few investees. At December 31, 2003, 68.9% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated in four investees. 34 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures (Continued) Equity Price Risk (Continued) Berkshire’s preferred strategy is to hold equity investments for very long periods of time. Thus, Berkshire management is not necessarily troubled by short term equity price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. Berkshire strives to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short term equity price volatility. The carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices or management’s estimates of fair value as of the balance sheet dates. Market prices are subject to fluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. Furthermore, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold. The table below summarizes Berkshire’s equity price risks as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in Berkshire’s equity investment portfolio. Dollars are in millions.

Effective January 2002, GRS commenced the run-off of its business. It is expected that the run-off will take several years to complete. Since January 2002, approximately two-thirds of GRS’s contracts have been terminated. GRS manages its market risk from derivatives by estimating the effect on operating results of potential changes in market variables over time, based on historical market volatility, correlation data and informed judgment. GRS’s weekly maximum aggregate market risk target was $15 million in 2003 and weekly losses exceeded that amount on two occasions. In addition to these daily and weekly assessments of risk, GRS prepares periodic stress tests to assess its exposure to extreme movements in various market risk factors. The estimated average expected weekly market risk, as calculated using the methodology described over one week intervals was $5 million in 2003 and $4 million in 2002. GRS evaluates and records a fair-value adjustment to recognize counterparty credit exposure and future costs associated with administering each contract. The expected credit exposure for each trade is initially established on the trade date and is estimated through the use of a proprietary credit exposure model that is based on historical default probabilities, market volatilities and, if applicable, the legal right of setoff. These exposures are continually monitored and adjusted due to changes in the credit quality of the counterparty, changes in interest and currency rates or changes in other factors affecting credit exposure. During 2003 and 2002, Berkshire entered into a significant number and amount of foreign currency forward contracts. Generally, these contracts provide that Berkshire receive certain foreign currencies and pay U.S. dollars at specified exchange rates and at specified future dates. Management entered into these contracts as an overall economic hedge of Berkshire’s net assets and business activities. The value of these contracts is subject to change due primarily to changes in the spot exchange rates and to a lesser degree, interest rates and time value. The 35 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures (Continued) Derivatives Risk (Continued) duration of the contracts is generally less than twelve months. The aggregate notional value of such contracts at December 31, 2003 was approximately $11 billion. Unrealized gains from these contracts totaled approximately $630 million at December 31, 2003. Berkshire monitors the currency positions daily for each currency. The following table summarizes the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2003 and shows the estimated changes in values of the contracts assuming changes in the underlying exchange rates applied immediately and uniformly across all currencies. The changes in value do not necessarily reflect the best or worst case results and therefore, actual results may differ. Dollars are in millions.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Insurance – underwriting $ (90 ) $ 728 $ 657 Insurance – investment income 6,484 4,807 5,039 Railroad 5,946 5,990 5,161 Utilities and energy 3,904 3,572 3,141 Manufacturing, service and retailing 12,512 11,120 8,300 Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) (53,612 ) 62,340 31,591 Other* 2,037 1,238 (11,368 ) Net earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ (22,819 ) $ 89,795 $ 42,521 * Includes goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $157 million in 2022, $259 million in 2021 and $11.0 billion in 2020, which includes our share of charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. The COVID-19 pandemic affected our operating businesses in varying ways and degrees, particularly in 2020 and 2021. Significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs emerged in 2021 and persisted in 2022. Further, geopolitical conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, developed in 2022 and are continuing in 2023. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of these events on our businesses. Nor can we reliably predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Insurance underwriting generated an after-tax loss of $90 million in 2022 and after-tax earnings of $728 million in 2021 and $657 million in 2020. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $2.4 billion in 2022, $2.3 billion in 2021 and $750 million in 2020. Underwriting results in 2022 were also negatively impacted by increases in private passenger automobile claims frequencies and severities at GEICO, and favorably impacted by higher earnings from reinsurance underwriting and foreign currency exchange rate gains arising from the remeasurement of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Underwriting results in 2021 were favorably impacted by reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively impacted by higher private passenger auto claims frequencies and severities and by the reduction in earned premium from the GEICO Giveback program, as well as from high claims costs in the life reinsurance business. Underwriting results in 2020 included the effects of the pandemic, arising from premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program, significantly reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile insurance and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance coverages. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased $1.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to increased dividend income and higher interest rates. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2021 and 2020 were negatively affected by low interest rates on our substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. K-33 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Results of Operations (Continued) After-tax earnings of our railroad, BNSF were relatively unchanged in 2022 compared to 2021 and increased 16.1% in 2021 versus 2020. Results in 2022 reflected higher revenue per car/unit, substantially offset by lower overall freight volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs. The earnings increase in 2021 reflected overall higher freight volumes, higher average revenue per car/unit and improved productivity, partly offset by higher average fuel prices and volume related costs. Earnings in 2020 reflected relatively low railroad operating revenues from reduced shipping volumes, attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 9.3% in 2022 compared to 2021 and 13.7% in 2021 versus 2020. The increase in 2022 reflected higher earnings from other energy businesses, including tax equity investments and the Northern Powergrid businesses, as well as from the natural gas pipeline businesses, partly offset by lower earnings from the real estate brokerage business. The increase in 2021 reflected higher earnings from the U.S. utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 12.5% in 2022 compared to 2021 and 34.0% in 2021 versus 2020. Operating results in 2022 were mixed among our various businesses. While customer demand for products and services was relatively good in 2022, demand began to weaken in the second half of the year at certain of our businesses. We experienced the negative effects of higher materials, freight, labor and other input costs through much of 2022. Many of our businesses generated significantly higher earnings in 2021 compared to 2020, attributable to relatively strong customer demand for products and higher selling prices, partially offset by higher materials, freight and other input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains. Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) in each of the three years presented predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment gains and losses on investments in equity securities, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Other earnings included after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of approximately $1.3 billion in 2022 and $1.0 billion in 2021 and after-tax losses of $764 million in 2020 related to the non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). Other earnings also included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $157 million in 2022, $259 million in 2021 and $11.0 billion in 2020. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Approximately $9.8 billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016. Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the periodic operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. We currently consider pre-tax incurred losses exceeding $150 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in 2022 included Hurricane Ian and floods in Australia, while significant events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida, floods in Europe and Winter Storm Uri. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $143 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $125 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. K-34 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). On October 19, 2022, Berkshire acquired Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”), which operates property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses. These businesses were included in the BH Primary and BHRG underwriting results beginning as of that date. We strive to produce pre-tax underwriting earnings (premiums earned less losses incurred and underwriting expenses) over the long term in all business categories, except for BHRG’s retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts. Time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing prices for these contracts. We normally receive all premiums at the contract inception date, which are immediately available for investment. Ultimate claim payments can extend for decades and are expected to exceed premiums, producing underwriting losses over the claim settlement periods, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss): GEICO $ (1,880 ) $ 1,259 $ 3,428 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 393 607 110 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 1,389 (930 ) (2,700 ) Pre-tax underwriting earnings (98 ) 936 838 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (8 ) 208 181 Net underwriting earnings (loss) $ (90 ) $ 728 $ 657 Effective income tax rate 8.5 % 22.2 % 21.5 % GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 39,107 $ 38,395 $ 34,928 Premiums earned $ 38,984 100.0 $ 37,706 100.0 $ 35,093 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 36,297 93.1 30,999 82.2 26,018 74.1 Underwriting expenses 4,567 11.7 5,448 14.5 5,647 16.1 Total losses and expenses 40,864 104.8 36,447 96.7 31,665 90.2 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ (1,880 ) $ 1,259 $ 3,428 GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting results in each of the past three years were significantly affected by changes in average claims frequencies and severities. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies were significantly below historical levels from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects were partially offset by higher average claims severities and lower premiums earned from the GEICO Giveback program, which provided a 15% premium reduction to all new or renewing voluntary auto and motorcycle policies between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Starting in the second quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies began to increase as driving by policyholders increased. GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting losses in 2022 reflected significant increases in average claims severities, primarily due to significant cost inflation in property and physical damage claims, which began to accelerate in the second half of 2021 and have continued through 2022. Increases in used car prices are producing increased claims severities on total losses and shortages of car parts are contributing to elevated claims severities on partial losses. In addition, injury claims severities continued to trend higher in 2022. K-35 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) 2022 versus 2021 Premiums written increased $712 million (1.9%) in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increases in average premiums per auto policy due to rate increases, which were substantially offset by a decrease in policies-in-force. Voluntary auto policies-in-force declined 8.9% in 2022 compared to 2021 while average premiums per voluntary auto policy increased 11.3%. Premiums earned increased $1.3 billion (3.4%) in 2022 compared to 2021, partially attributable to a reduction in 2021 of approximately $475 million from the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback program. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $5.3 billion (17.1%) in 2022 compared to 2021. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) was 93.1% in 2022, an increase of 10.9 percentage points over 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher claims frequencies and severities, as well as lower reductions of ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ events. Claims frequencies in 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (one to two percent range), bodily injury and collision (four to five percent range) and personal injury (three to four percent range). Average claims severities in 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (twenty-one to twenty-two percent range), collision (fourteen to sixteen percent range) and bodily injury (nine to eleven percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ loss events of $653 million in 2022 compared to $1.8 billion in 2021. The reductions in 2022 reflected decreases in all major coverages except collision and property damage coverages, while the reductions in 2021 were across all major coverages. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were approximately $400 million from Hurricane Ian in 2022 and $375 million from Hurricane Ida in 2021. Underwriting expenses decreased $881 million (16.2%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to significant reductions in advertising costs and lower employee-related costs. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) was 11.7% in 2022, a decrease of 2.8 percentage points compared to 2021, attributable to both the decrease in expenses as well as the increase in earned premiums. GEICO has successfully obtained premium rate increase approvals from certain states in response to the significant claims costs increases it has experienced in recent years. As a result, we currently expect GEICO to generate an underwriting profit in 2023. 2021 versus 2020 Premiums written in 2021 increased $3.5 billion (9.9%) compared to 2020, which included a reduction of approximately $2.9 billion attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. Premiums earned in 2021 increased $2.6 billion (7.4%) compared to 2020. The GEICO Giveback Program reduced earned premiums by approximately $2.5 billion in 2020 with the remainder of the impact included in 2021. Voluntary auto policies-in-force in 2021 were slightly higher compared to 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $5.0 billion (19.1%) compared to 2020. GEICO’s loss ratio increased 8.1 percentage points compared to 2020. The increase in the loss ratio reflected an increase in average claims frequencies and severities and higher losses from significant catastrophe events, partially offset by increased reductions of ultimate estimated losses for claims occurring in prior years. Claims frequencies in 2021 were higher for all coverages, including property damage and bodily injury (thirteen to fourteen percent range), personal injury (sixteen to seventeen percent range) and collision (twenty-one to twenty-two percent range). Average claims severities in 2021 were also higher for property damage coverage (two to three percent range), collision coverage (fifteen to sixteen percent range) and bodily injury coverage (eight to ten percent range). Ultimate claim loss estimates for claims occurring in prior years were reduced approximately $1.8 billion in 2021 and $253 million in 2020. Losses incurred attributable to Hurricane Ida in 2021 were $375 million, while losses in 2020 were $81 million from significant catastrophe events. Underwriting expenses decreased $199 million (3.5%) compared to 2020, reflecting lower advertising expenses. GEICO’s expense ratio decreased 1.6 percentage points in 2021, reflecting lower expenses and higher premiums earned. K-36 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group consists of several independently managed businesses that provide a variety of primarily commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare professional liability, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary’s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”). This group also includes Alleghany’s RSUI Group Inc. and CapSpecialty, Inc. (“Alleghany Insurance”) beginning October 19, 2022. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 14,619 $ 12,595 $ 10,212 Premiums earned $ 13,746 100.0 $ 11,575 100.0 $ 9,615 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 9,889 71.9 8,107 70.0 7,129 74.1 Underwriting expenses 3,464 25.2 2,861 24.8 2,376 24.7 Total losses and expenses 13,353 97.1 10,968 94.8 9,505 98.8 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 393 $ 607 $ 110 Premiums written increased $2.0 billion (16.1%) in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increases at BH Specialty (16%), USLI (16%), BHHC (15%) and MedPro Group (10%), and from the inclusion of Alleghany Insurance ($435 million). Premiums written increased $2.4 billion (23.3%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increases from BH Specialty (36%), MedPro Group (16%), NICO Primary (25%), GUARD (7%) and USLI (20%). The increases in each year were across a variety of coverages and in several markets. BH Primary’s loss ratio increased 1.9 percentage points compared to 2021, which decreased 4.1 percentage points versus 2020. Incurred losses from significant catastrophe events were $641 million in 2022 ($554 from Hurricane Ian), $433 million in 2021 ($239 million from Hurricane Ida) and $207 million in 2020 ($160 million from Hurricanes Laura and Sally). Incurred losses in 2020 also included increased liabilities attributable to the pandemic of $167 million. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $428 million in 2022, $631 million in 2021 and $265 million in 2020. BH Primary insurers continue to write significant levels of workers’ compensation, commercial and professional liability insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Claims liabilities could be greater than anticipated due to a variety of factors. Underwriting expenses increased $603 million (21.1%) in 2022 compared to 2021, while underwriting expenses increased $485 million (20.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020. These increases reflected the increases in premiums earned and changes in business mix. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and, beginning October 19, 2022, Alleghany’s Transatlantic Reinsurance Company and affiliates (“TransRe Group”).

Premiums written increased $854 million (6.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to net new business, increased participations and improved prices on renewals and favorable currency translation effects. The increase was primarily attributable to property coverages. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $727 million (7.4%) in 2022 compared to 2021 and were relatively unchanged in 2021 compared to 2020. Losses incurred from significant catastrophe events were $2.0 billion in 2022 ($1.6 billion from Hurricane Ian), $2.1 billion ($933 million from Hurricane Ida) in 2021 and $667 million in 2020 ($357 million in the aggregate from Hurricanes Laura and Sally). Losses incurred in 2020 also included $964 million attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ events of $1.6 billion in 2022 and $718 million in 2021 and increases of $162 million in 2020. Underwriting expenses as percentages of premiums earned decreased 2.9 percentage points in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange rate effects and changes in business mix. Underwriting expenses included foreign currency exchange gains of $371 million in 2022 compared to $173 million in 2021, related to the remeasurement of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. The expense ratio in 2021 decreased 2.3 percentage points compared to 2020, primarily attributable to changes in business mix and foreign currency effects. K-38 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 5,185 $ 5,621 $ 5,848 Premiums earned $ 5,279 100.0 $ 5,648 100.0 $ 5,861 100.0 Life and health insurance benefits 4,004 75.8 4,933 87.3 4,883 83.3 Underwriting expenses 983 18.7 1,136 20.2 996 17.0 Total benefits and expenses 4,987 94.5 6,069 107.5 5,879 100.3 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ 292 $ (421 ) $ (18 ) Life/health premiums written decreased $436 million (7.8%) in 2022 compared to 2021 which decreased 3.9% from 2020. The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation effects ($289 million) and decreased volume in the Asia Pacific region. Premiums written in 2020 included $710 million from a contract that covered U.S. health risks that did not renew in 2021. Otherwise, premiums written in 2021 increased 9.4% versus 2020, primarily due to volume growth in the Asia Pacific region and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Life and health benefits declined $929 million (18.8%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to relatively high pandemic-related mortality claims in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America in 2021. Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by increased life benefits from COVID-19-related claims and from increased liabilities from changes in assumptions used in estimating disability benefit liabilities in Australia, which were mostly offset by lower other life claims and reduced losses from U.S. long-term care business in run-off. Retroactive reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance underwriting results primarily derive from the runoff of contracts written several years ago. Pre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax foreign currency gains were $168 million in 2022 and $58 million in 2021 versus pre-tax losses of $171 million in 2020. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $836 million in 2022, $840 million in 2021 and $1.1 billion in 2020, primarily from deferred charge amortization. Underwriting results also reflected the effects of changes in the estimates of the timing of future payments and amounts of ultimate claim liabilities. Estimated ultimate claim liabilities for prior years’ contracts were increased $86 million in 2022 and reduced $974 million in 2021, which net of related changes in unamortized deferred charges, produced relatively insignificant effects on underwriting earnings. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $35.4 billion at December 31, 2022, a decline of $2.4 billion since December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to paid claims. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $9.9 billion at December 31, 2022, a decline of $769 million since December 31, 2021. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned decreased $76 million (11.6%) in 2022 compared to 2021, which increased $92 million (16.3%) compared to 2020. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. K-39 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Our periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses from the recurring accretion of time-value discounted annuity liabilities, which includes discount accruals on liabilities of contracts without life contingencies. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency gains of $164 million in 2022 and $18 million in 2021, and pre-tax losses of $67 million in 2020. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $696 million in 2022, $526 million in 2021 and $550 million in 2020. Pre-tax losses in 2022 included approximately $130 million attributable to the termination of a reinsurance contract, in which the settlement paid exceeded the carrying value of the liabilities. Pre-tax losses in 2021 were partially offset by the effects of higher mortality and by higher interest rates applicable to settlements under certain contracts. Discounted liabilities were $15.4 billion at December 31, 2022, which included $3.9 billion for contracts without life contingencies, and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%. Upon the adoption of ASU 2018-12 in 2023, the discount rates on contracts with life-contingent liabilities will be adjusted quarterly based upon prevailing interest rates which could have a significant effect on our recorded liabilities. The periodic effect from discount rate changes will be reflected in other comprehensive income. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax gains of $117 million in 2022 and $114 million in 2021, and pre-tax losses of $18 million in 2020. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting earnings in 2022 and 2021 were primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate increases and changes in securities markets. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 2021 vs 2020 Dividend income $ 6,039 $ 5,060 $ 4,890 19.3 % 3.5 % Interest and other investment income 1,685 589 1,059 186.1 (44.4 ) Pre-tax net investment income 7,724 5,649 5,949 36.7 (5.0 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,240 842 910 Net investment income $ 6,484 $ 4,807 $ 5,039 Effective income tax rate 16.0 % 14.9 % 15.3 % Dividend income increased $979 million (19.3%) in 2022 compared to 2021 and increased $170 million (3.5%) in 2021 versus 2020. The increase in 2022 reflected an overall increase in equity security investments during 2022. Dividend income also varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Dividend income included $46 million in 2022, $121 million in 2021 and $26 million in 2020 from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. Interest and other investment income increased $1.1 billion (186.1%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to significant increases in interest income due to interest rate increases during the year, as well as the inclusion of interest income on assets of Alleghany’s insurance subsidiaries. Interest and other investment income in 2021 declined 44.4% compared to 2020, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. K-40 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $164 billion at December 31, 2022, $147 billion at December 31, 2021 and $138 billion at December 31, 2020. Float at December 31, 2022 included approximately $14 billion attributable to Alleghany’s insurance and reinsurance businesses. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting losses of $98 million in 2022, and the cost of float was nominal. In 2021 and 2020, our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting gains, and consequently, the cost of float in each year was negative. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 follows (in millions).

K-41 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with over 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major business groups by type of product shipped including consumer products, industrial products, agricultural products and coal.

BNSF’s pre-tax earnings decreased 1.9% in 2022 from 2021. Pre-tax earnings in 2022 were impacted by lower volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs, offset by higher yield and fuel surcharge revenue. Operating revenues from consumer products increased 11.8% in 2022 to $9.2 billion compared to 2021, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 8.3%. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower intermodal shipments, resulting from supply chain disruptions and lower west coast imports during the second half of the year. Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.6 billion in 2022, an increase of 5.6% from 2021, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 5.3%. The volume decrease was primarily due to a decrease in petroleum products related to lower demand for shipments of crude by rail and lower building products, steel and taconite shipments, partially offset by increased mineral shipments. Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 12.6% to $5.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflected higher revenue per car/unit partially offset by lower volumes of 2.0%. The decrease in volumes was primarily due to lower grain exports and fertilizer shipments, partially offset by higher volumes of domestic grains, renewable diesel and feedstocks. Operating revenues from coal increased 21.7% to $3.9 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit. Coal volumes were unchanged compared to 2021. K-42 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (Continued) Railroad operating expenses were $16.6 billion in 2022, an increase of $2.9 billion (21.2%) compared to 2021. Our ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues increased 5.0 percentage points to 65.9% in 2022 versus 2021. The operating expense increase was primarily attributable to significant increases in the cost of fuel, as well as higher compensation and benefits expense. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $557 million (11.9%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to wage inflation, including the impact from the ratified union labor agreements, higher health and welfare costs and lower productivity. Fuel expenses increased $1.8 billion (65.6%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher average fuel prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $384 million (21.8%) in 2022 compared to 2021, due to general inflation, lower gains from land and easement sales and higher casualty and litigation costs. Approximately 31,000 of BNSF’s employees are members of a labor union. The U.S. Class I railroads and rail labor unions were engaged in multi-party national negotiations from January 2020 through June 2022. Federal mediation was included in that timeframe, followed by a release from the National Mediation Board and subsequent appointment of a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB), in accordance with the Railway Labor Act. The PEB issued its report and recommendations to settle the bargaining disputes on August 16, 2022. Tentative agreements based on these recommendations were reached with all labor unions in September 2022. Thereafter, a majority of the unions ratified those agreements with the remainder being imposed by Congress in December 2022. This concluded the national round which is not subject to re-opening until late 2024. 2021 versus 2020 Railroad operating revenues increased 11.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting higher volumes of 6.9%, as well as a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit resulting from business mix changes and higher fuel surcharge revenue attributable to higher fuel prices. Pre-tax earnings were $7.9 billion in 2021, an increase of 15.7% from 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant economic slowdown that adversely affected our volumes in 2020. Revenue changes in 2021 were driven by continued improvements from the 2020 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by disruptions in the global supply chain. Operating revenues from consumer products increased 13.7% in 2021 to $8.3 billion compared to 2020, reflecting increased volumes of 7.7% and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to growth in intermodal in both international and domestic shipments driven by increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and increased e-commerce activity. Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.0% from 2020. Volumes increased 5.4% while average revenue per car/unit was nearly unchanged from 2020. The volume increase was primarily due to improvement in the U.S. industrial economy, driving higher volumes in the construction and building sectors, partially offset by lower petroleum volumes due to unfavorable market conditions in the energy sector. Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 5.8% to $5.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The revenue change reflected a volume increase of 2.9% due to higher domestic grain shipments and higher volumes of ethanol and related commodities, as well as higher revenue per car/unit. Operating revenues from coal increased 21.5% to $3.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 attributable to higher volumes of 8.9% in 2021, as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase in 2021 was attributable to increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand. Railroad operating expenses were $13.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.3 billion (10.2%) compared to 2020. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased 0.7 percentage points to 60.9% in 2021 versus 2020. The increase in railroad operating expenses reflected higher volumes and higher average fuel prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of productivity improvements. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $154 million (3.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased volumes, wage inflation and health and welfare costs, partially offset by productivity improvements. Fuel expenses increased $977 million (54.6%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher average fuel prices. Purchased service expenses increased $79 million (4.0%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher volumes and the effects of insurance recoveries in 2020 related to 2019 flooding, partially offset by improved productivity. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $79 million (4.7%) compared to 2020, due to higher volume-related costs. K-43 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy We currently own 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“LNG interest”), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Three of the natural gas pipeline systems and the LNG interest were acquired on November 1, 2020 from Dominion Energy, Inc. (“BHE GT&S”). Other energy businesses include two regulated electricity distribution businesses operated by BHE subsidiaries (referred to as Northern Powergrid) in Great Britain, a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments. BHE also operates a residential real estate brokerage business and a large network of real estate brokerage franchises in the United States. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected.

K-44 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (Continued) The discussion of BHE’s operating results that follows is based on after-tax earnings, reflecting how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated. A summary of net earnings attributable to BHE follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 2021 vs 2020 U.S. utilities $ 2,295 $ 2,211 $ 1,969 3.8 % 12.3 % Natural gas pipelines 1,040 807 528 28.9 52.8 Other energy businesses 1,338 979 953 36.7 2.7 Real estate brokerage 100 387 375 (74.2 ) 3.2 Corporate interest and other (421 ) (337 ) (352 ) 24.9 (4.3 ) $ 4,352 $ 4,047 $ 3,473 7.5 16.5 2022 versus 2021 Our U.S. utilities operate in several states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming (PacifiCorp), Iowa and Illinois (MEC) and Nevada (NV Energy). After-tax earnings increased $84 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The earnings increase reflected higher electric utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and a $157 million increase in production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service at PacifiCorp and MEC, partially offset by higher operating expenses and state income taxes. Operating expenses increased due to higher costs associated with certain regulatory mechanisms at MEC and NV Energy, increases in general and plant maintenance costs, incremental depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service and higher accruals at PacifiCorp associated with the 2020 wildfires. The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $7.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $586 million (8.3%) compared to 2021. The increase reflected higher operating revenue from favorable retail and wholesale pricing and increases in retail customer volumes, partially offset by increases in thermal generation and purchased power costs. Retail customer volumes increased 2.4% (1.6% at PacifiCorp, 4.3% at MEC and 2.2% at NV Energy) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impact of weather. Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings increased $233 million in 2022 compared to 2021. Substantially all of the increase was derived from BHE GT&S, primarily attributable to higher regulated storage and service revenues from a general rate case settlement and higher revenues and margins from non-regulated activities, as well as income tax adjustments. Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings increased $359 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increased wind tax equity investment earnings of $200 million and the impact in 2021 on income tax expense of $109 million at Northern Powergrid related to the enactment in June 2021 of an increase in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. The earnings increase also reflected higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects and earnings from new gas exploration and solar projects, partially offset by lower earnings from natural gas generating facilities and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects in 2022. The increase in wind tax equity investment earnings reflected the impact of losses in 2021 on pre-existing tax equity investments due to the February 2021 winter storms as well as increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings decreased $287 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease reflected lower brokerage services revenues and margins, primarily due to an 11% reduction in closed brokerage transaction volumes, as well as lower mortgage services revenues and margins from a 40% decrease in closed transaction volumes, attributable to lower homeowner refinancing activity resulting from rising interest rates. Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $84 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower state income tax benefits and higher interest expense from corporate debt issued in 2022. K-45 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (Continued) 2021 versus 2020 The U.S. utilities’ after-tax earnings increased $242 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and an increase of $139 million in production tax credits recognized at PacifiCorp and MEC, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased due to higher costs associated with certain regulatory mechanisms at MEC, increased depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service and by the impacts of a depreciation study effective January 1, 2021 at PacifiCorp. The operating expense increase was partially offset by the impact of accruals at PacifiCorp in 2020 associated with wildfires and changes to a settlement agreement in 2021 related to a hydroelectric facility, as well as lower costs associated with certain regulatory mechanisms at NV Energy. The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $7.1 billion in 2021, an increase of $126 million (1.8%) compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher operating revenue from increases in retail and wholesale customer volumes and favorable wholesale pricing, partially offset by increases in thermal generation and purchased power costs as well as lower base tariff general rates in 2021 and a favorable regulatory decision in 2020 at NV Energy. Retail customer volumes increased 3.8% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impact of weather. Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings increased $279 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The earnings increase in 2021 was primarily due to incremental earnings of $211 million from the BHE GT&S acquisition completed in November 2020. In addition, earnings in 2021 reflected the effects of higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas due to increased demand from the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by lower transportation revenue primarily due to lower volumes for the remainder of the year. Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings increased $26 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings at Northern Powergrid ($46 million), partially offset by lower earnings from renewable energy. The increase at Northern Powergrid was attributable to higher tariff rates and units distributed, lower write-offs of gas exploration costs and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $74 million from increases in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rates in both 2021 and 2020. The decline in earnings from renewable energy reflected a reduction in wind tax equity investment earnings of $56 million, which included increased losses from pre-existing tax equity investments of $165 million, largely attributable to the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $12 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was due to an increase in closed brokerage transaction volumes in 2021, partially offset by lower mortgage volume due to a decrease in refinance activity. Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings increased $15 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in state income tax benefits and higher earnings from non-regulated energy services, offset by higher operating expenses and higher interest expense from corporate debt issued in 2020. K-46 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Beginning January 31, 2023, this group will include Pilot Travel Centers. Percentage change 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 2021 vs 2020 Revenues Manufacturing $ 75,781 $ 68,730 $ 59,079 10.3 % 16.3 % Service and retailing 91,512 84,282 75,018 8.6 12.3 $ 167,293 $ 153,012 $ 134,097 9.3 14.1 Pre-tax earnings Manufacturing $ 11,177 $ 9,841 $ 8,010 13.6 % 22.9 % Service and retailing 5,042 4,711 2,879 7.0 63.6 16,219 14,552 10,889 11.5 33.6 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 3,707 3,432 2,589 Net earnings* $ 12,512 $ 11,120 $ 8,300 Effective income tax rate 22.2 % 23.0 % 23.3 % Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues 9.7 % 9.5 % 8.1 % * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which primarily related to the amortization of identified intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings above were $681 million in 2022, $690 million in 2021 and $783 million in 2020. In 2020, net earnings also excluded after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $10.4 billion. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page K-33 and in the “Other” earnings table on page K-56. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 2021 vs 2020 Revenues Industrial products $ 30,824 $ 28,176 $ 25,667 9.4 % 9.8 % Building products 28,896 24,974 21,244 15.7 17.6 Consumer products 16,061 15,580 12,168 3.1 28.0 $ 75,781 $ 68,730 $ 59,079 Pre-tax earnings Industrial products $ 4,862 $ 4,469 $ 3,755 8.8 % 19.0 % Building products 4,789 3,390 2,858 41.3 18.6 Consumer products 1,526 1,982 1,397 (23.0 ) 41.9 $ 11,177 $ 9,841 $ 8,010 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Industrial products 15.8 % 15.9 % 14.6 % Building products 16.6 % 13.6 % 13.5 % Consumer products 9.5 % 12.7 % 11.5 % K-47 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). Beginning October 19, 2022, this group includes the structural steel fabrication products business conducted through W&W|AFCO Steel, acquired in connection with the Alleghany acquisition Additionally, the Alleghany businesses included certain other smaller manufacturers that primarily became part of Marmon. 2022 versus 2021 Revenues of the industrial products group in 2022 increased $2.6 billion (9.4%) and pre-tax earnings increased $393 million (8.8%) compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2022 was 15.8%, a decrease of 0.1 percentage points compared 2021. PCC’s revenues were $7.5 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.1 billion (16.5%) compared to 2021. PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The revenue increase in 2022 was primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products. Commercial aircraft delivery rates by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of narrow-body aircraft have rebounded since the onset of the pandemic. Deliveries of wide-body aircraft remain relatively low, in part, attributable to the pause in the Boeing 787 program. However, Boeing resumed deliveries in the third quarter of 2022. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2022 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 1.6% compared to 2021. PCC’s results in 2022 were negatively affected by increased costs for labor and training, materials and utilities and supply chain disruptions, as well as a $59 million reduction in pension plan income. PCC management has taken and will continue to take actions to improve operations, maintain safety and prepare for increased demand for its products. Growth in PCC’s revenues and earnings will be predicated on the ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace demand, including managing through the current supply chain and employment environments. Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.7 billion in 2022, an increase of 3.2% compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflected higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower volumes and adverse foreign currency translation effects from the stronger U.S. Dollar. Sales volumes throughout 2022 were restricted by effects of supply constraints for certain raw materials and the effects of unplanned plant maintenance activities, both of which limited Lubrizol’s production capabilities. The increase in average selling prices was driven by escalating prices for raw materials, including oil feedstocks, as well as for utilities, packaging, shipping and freight costs. We believe supply chain and required maintenance constraints are easing and that we can increase production rates and sales volumes in 2023. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2022 increased 48.6% compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings in 2022 included insurance recoveries of $242 million related to a fire in 2019 at the Rouen, France facility and a fire in 2021 at the Rockton, Illinois, facility compared to insurance recoveries of $55 million in 2021. Earnings in 2022 also included aggregate losses related to the Rockton, Illinois fire of $36 million compared to aggregate losses and asset impairment charges in 2021 of $257 million related to the Rockton facility fire and an underperforming business in the Advanced Materials product lines. Earnings in 2022 were also negatively impacted by rising raw material costs, lower sales volumes, higher unplanned maintenance expenses, and by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partially offset by higher selling prices. Earnings in 2021 were negatively impacted by severe winter storms, which caused industry-wide temporary facilities closures, including at our Additives facilities, which experienced lost sales and incremental manufacturing and other operating costs. Marmon’s revenues were $10.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $934 million (9.6%) compared to 2021. Nearly all of Marmon’s business groups generated higher revenues in 2022, led by significant increases in the Transportation, Retail Solutions, Metal Services and Crane groups, which contributed 82% of the increase. These increases generally reflected higher volumes and prices in our heavy-duty truck & trailer, shopping cart and store shelving businesses, stronger demand in Canada for metal services and higher demand in the mining and infrastructure markets. Revenues of most of Marmon’s other groups, particularly those serving the transit, oil & gas, utility and restaurant markets, also increased in 2022, reflecting higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting lower renewal rates and fewer third-party tank car sales. K-48 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2022 increased 11.3% compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 reflected increases in the Transportation, Metal Services, Retail, Crane and several other business groups due to higher volumes and pricing, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting lower renewal rates, higher repair costs and losses of approximately $90 million related to the shutdown in the second quarter of its business in Russia. IMC’s revenues increased 4.5% to $3.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increased sales in most regions, partially offset by the foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar, lower sales in China (attributable to the pandemic) and the effects the Russia-Ukraine conflict in Europe. IMC’s pre-tax earnings decreased 2.5% in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to lower average gross sales margins, primarily attributable to changes in product sales mix and higher raw material costs. Earnings were also negatively affected by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and the Russian-Ukraine conflict. 2021 versus 2020 Revenues of the industrial products group in 2021 increased $2.5 billion (9.8%) from 2020. Pre-tax earnings increased $714 million (19.0%) compared to 2020 and pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2021 was 15.9%, an increase of 1.3 percentage points compared to 2020. PCC’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, a decrease of $853 million (11.6%) compared to 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and OEM aircraft production in 2021 and 2020. PCC’s revenues were negatively impacted in both years by reduced aircraft production levels, which reflected order delays and cancellations by airlines and inventory reduction initiatives within the industry. PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 78.8% compared to 2020, which reflected significant restructuring costs and inefficiencies associated with reduction in production. Asset impairment and restructuring costs in 2020 were $295 million. The 2021 earnings increase also reflected the actions taken by management in 2020 and 2021 to resize, restructure and improve operations and to prepare for more normalized demand, as well as from a decline in restructuring costs. Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2020. The increase reflects higher average selling prices, driven by significant increases in materials and other manufacturing costs, as well as slightly higher volumes. Sales volumes in the Additives product lines in 2021 were negatively affected by the impacts of the severe winter weather events in the first quarter, raw materials supply constraints and unplanned maintenance in the second half of the year. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 decreased 50.8% compared to 2020. The earnings decline in 2021 included previously mentioned losses of $257 million related to the Rockton, Illinois facility fire and asset impairment charges, as well as the adverse effects of rising raw material costs and the winter storms in 2021. Marmon’s revenues were $9.8 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.1 billion (27.9%) compared to 2020, which was negatively impacted by the initial effects of the pandemic. Revenues in 2021 from the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups increased 54% over 2020, accounting for over half of the aggregate increase in Marmon’s revenues. These increases were attributable to higher volumes and prices, including the impact of significantly higher average copper and metal prices. Revenues of most of Marmon’s other groups, particularly those serving the construction, automotive, heavy-duty truck and restaurant markets, also increased in 2021, reflecting higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by the impact of divestitures and business closures in the Water Technologies and Retail Solutions groups and lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting fewer railcars on lease and changes in lease mix. K-49 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased 40.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to earnings increases in the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups due to higher volumes and average margins and relatively low earnings in 2020 attributable to the pandemic. Earnings of several other business groups also increased attributable to higher sales volumes, sales mix changes and lower restructuring charges, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Water Technologies groups. IMC’s revenues increased 19.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting improving business conditions in most geographic regions and favorable foreign currency translation effects. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 47.7% in 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to higher customer demand, improved manufacturing efficiencies, operating cost management saving initiatives and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). 2022 versus 2021 Revenues of the building products group increased $3.9 billion (15.7%) in 2022 and pre-tax earnings increased $1.4 billion (41.3%) compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 16.6% in 2022 and 13.6% in 2021. During 2021 and much of 2022, our businesses experienced relatively strong customer demand and higher sales volumes. Our building products businesses benefited in recent years from the low interest rate environment. However, interest rates in the U.S. increased significantly during 2022, which contributed to slowing demand for new home construction in the fourth quarter. As such, comparative revenues and earnings in the near term will likely decline from current levels. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $12.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $2.2 billion (21.1%) over 2021. Revenues from home sales for the year increased $2.1 billion (25.1%) in 2022 to approximately $10.4 billion, primarily due to higher average selling prices. New home unit sales increased 6.2% in 2022, reflecting a 6.0% increase in factory-built manufactured home unit sales and a 7.1% increase in site-built home unit sales. However, unit sales in the fourth quarter of 2022 declined 3.9% from 2021, and our net order backlog declined significantly during 2022. We expect the comparative decline in unit sales to accelerate in the near term. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 4.7% in 2022 compared to 2021. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $21.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $2.5 billion from December 31, 2021. Actual and anticipated loan foreclosures rose during the fourth quarter of 2022. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $2.4 billion in 2022, an increase of $685 million (40.7%) compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 reflected higher home sales, gross margin rates and net interest income. As previously mentioned, we expect unit home sales to decline in the near term and we anticipate earnings will also decline in 2023 compared to 2022. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $16.2 billion in 2022, an increase of 11.8% versus 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices, and to a lesser extent, from higher unit volumes in certain product lines and product mix changes. Significant cost inflation in 2021, that continued through 2022, largely drove the higher selling prices. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $2.4 billion in 2022, an increase of 41.9% over 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues was 15.0% in 2022, a 3.2 percentage point increase compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 benefitted from higher selling prices and strong demand in certain product categories, as well as an increase in gains from certain business divestitures and asset sales and reduced impairment and restructuring charges. The increase in earnings in 2022 also reflected the negative impact of severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021, which reduced sales and increased production and other operating costs in 2021. K-50 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) 2021 versus 2020 Revenues of the building products group increased $3.7 billion (17.6%) in 2021 and pre-tax earnings increased $532 million (18.6%) compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.6% in 2021 and 13.5% in 2020. During 2021, our businesses experienced strong customer demand and higher sales volumes. We also experienced various forms of supply chain disruptions that contributed to considerable raw material and logistics cost inflation and supply constraints. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $10.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.9 billion (22.2%) over 2020. Revenues from home sales increased $1.8 billion (26.5%) in 2021 to approximately $8.3 billion, reflecting increased revenue per home sold, changes in sales mix and a net increase in new units sold. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 15.8% in 2021, while factory-built manufactured home unit sales increased 1.5%. Site-built home unit sales were constrained by longer construction periods arising from supply chain constraints and labor shortages. Financial services revenues increased 7.8% in 2021 compared to 2020. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $18.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $1.7 billion compared to December 31, 2020. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $440 million (35.3%) compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 reflected higher earnings from home sales, mortgage originations, net interest income and lower provisions for expected credit losses, partially offset by the impact of rising manufacturing and supply chain costs. The provision for expected credit losses in 2020 was unusually high and included provisions for the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $14.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 14.4% versus 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by significantly higher input and supply chain costs, as well as higher unit volumes for paint and coatings, flooring, insulation, roofing and other engineered products. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.7% over 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 11.8% in 2021, a 1.0 percentage point decrease compared to 2020. While customer demand in 2021 was generally strong, reduced availability of materials and other product inputs from supply chain disruptions negatively affected operating results. In addition, higher restructuring and impairment charges contributed to the reduction in our pre-tax margin rates. Consumer products The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl), jewelry products (Richline) and beginning October 19, 2022, Jazwares, LLC (“Jazwares”), a global toy company acquired in connection with the Alleghany acquisition. 2022 versus 2021 Consumer products group revenues increased $481 million (3.1%) in 2022 versus 2021, reflecting an 8.0% increase from Forest River and the impact of the Jazwares acquisition, substantially offset by lower apparel and footwear and Duracell revenues (4.7% in the aggregate). In the fourth quarter of 2022, consumer products revenues before the impact of the Jazwares acquisition declined 15.7%, driven by significant declines in recreational vehicle unit sales. Revenues of Forest River increased 8.0% in 2022 compared to 2021, while apparel and footwear and Duracell revenues decreased 4.5% and 5.2%, respectively. The declines in apparel and footwear revenues were driven by lower volumes, as major retailers reduced orders in response to rising inventories. Duracell’s revenue decline was primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar. K-51 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Consumer products (Continued) Consumer products group pre-tax earnings declined $456 million (23.0%) in 2022 compared to 2021 and as a percentage of revenues in 2022 decreased 3.2 percentage points to 9.5%. The earnings decline reflected lower aggregate earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses (68.0%) and Duracell (30.6%), partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River (7.6%). Our apparel businesses were negatively affected in 2022 by low sales volumes, reduced manufacturing efficiencies and higher input costs, including raw materials, freight, labor and other operating costs. The reductions in sales volumes and supply chain issues in 2021 and 2022 have also elevated our current inventories. We currently believe retailers will continue to constrain purchases in the near term and that our sales volumes and earnings will continue to be negatively affected. We are taking measures to right-size our operations for the long-term and reduce product inventories to more appropriate levels. Duracell’s earnings in 2022 declined, primarily due to lower sales, cost inflation and foreign currency translation effects. Earnings from Forest River increased in 2022, primarily due to the increase in unit sales in the first half of the year and higher average selling prices, partly offset by higher materials costs. However, sales volumes, revenues and earnings declined over the second half of the year compared to the elevated levels in the first half of 2022 and in 2021. We currently expect demand for recreational vehicles will continue to slow and Forest River’s comparative revenues and earnings to decline in 2023, particularly over the first half of the year. 2021 versus 2020 Consumer products group revenues increased $3.4 billion (28.0%) in 2021 versus 2020. Revenues from Forest River increased 40.2% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by a 27.6% increase in recreational vehicle unit sales and higher average selling prices, primarily due to significant increases in manufacturing costs. Revenues of several of our other consumer products businesses were significantly higher in 2021 as compared to 2020. The initial impacts of the pandemic in the first half of 2020 from temporary retail store closures and reduced demand had a severe impact on most of these businesses. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 25.3% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting significant increases in unit sales, partly attributable to inventory restocking by certain customers, and from increased consumer demand. Revenues from Richline increased 39.9%, while revenues from Duracell increased 2.4%. Consumer products group pre-tax earnings increased $585 million (41.9%) in 2021 compared to 2020 and as a percentage of revenues in 2021 increased 1.2 percentage points to 12.7%. The increase reflected significant earnings increases at many of our businesses. However, our consumer products businesses, particularly the apparel and footwear businesses, also experienced significant cost increases and supply chain disruptions, causing pre-tax margins in the second half of 2021 to be 1.1 percentage points lower than in the first half of the year. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 2021 vs 2020 Revenues Service $ 19,006 $ 15,872 $ 12,346 19.7 % 28.6 % Retailing 19,297 18,960 15,832 1.8 19.8 McLane 53,209 49,450 46,840 7.6 5.6 $ 91,512 $ 84,282 $ 75,018 Pre-tax earnings Service $ 3,047 $ 2,672 $ 1,600 14.0 % 67.0 % Retailing 1,724 1,809 1,028 (4.7 ) 76.0 McLane 271 230 251 17.8 (8.4 ) $ 5,042 $ 4,711 $ 2,879 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Service 16.0 % 16.8 % 13.0 % Retailing 8.9 % 9.5 % 6.5 % McLane 0.5 % 0.5 % 0.5 % K-52 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Beginning, October 19, 2022, this group includes IPS Integrated Project Services, LLC (IPS), a provider of various services in facilities construction management. 2022 versus 2021 Service group revenues increased $3.1 billion (19.7%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to revenue increases from TTI and the aviation services businesses, as well as the impact of the IPS acquisition. Revenues from TTI increased 17.4% in 2022 versus 2021. However, in the third quarter, new orders began to slow in certain regions and markets and the slowing of new orders was observed across nearly all regions in the fourth quarter. The slowing of electronic components demand is in part attributable to elevated inventory levels within the supply chain. Revenues from aviation services increased 18.2% in 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflected year-to-date increases in training hours (11%), customer flight hours (9%), most of which occurred in the first half of the year, and fuel surcharges to customers due to the increase in customer flight hours and significant increases in fuel prices. These increases were partially offset by changes in sales mix. Pre-tax earnings of our service business group increased $375 million (14.0%) in 2022 to $3.0 billion. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 16.0% in 2022, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points compared to 2021. The earnings increase in 2022 was attributable to TTI (19.4%) and aviation services (3.4%), as well as increased earnings from several of our smaller services businesses. The increase from TTI was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and higher average gross margin rates, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects in 2022 and a favorable legal settlement in 2021. The earnings increase from aviation services in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily attributable to improved product sales margins, increased training hours and lower restructuring costs at FlightSafety. Earnings at our smaller services companies increased $106 million (19.3%) over 2021, reflecting a combination of higher revenues and operating cost leverage. 2021 versus 2020 Service group revenues increased $3.5 billion (28.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to higher revenues from TTI and the aviation services businesses. Revenues from TTI increased 37.4% in 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to significantly higher volumes across all significant markets and product categories, and to a lesser extent, higher average prices and changes in sales mix. Customer demand accelerated throughout 2021, as customers attempted to maintain adequate inventories in response to high demand for components in end products and effects of supply chain disruptions. Revenues from aviation services increased 27.5% in 2021 over low 2020 levels, primarily due to higher training hours (24%) and customer flight hours (70%). Pre-tax earnings of our service business group increased $1.1 billion (67.0%) to $2.7 billion. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues was 16.8% in 2021, an increase of 3.8 percentage points compared to 2020. Earnings at nearly all service businesses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, with the largest increases from TTI, the aviation services businesses and the XTRA leasing business. TTI’s earnings increase was primarily attributable to increases in sales volumes, as well as from improved operating cost leverage, changes in sales mix and a gain from a legal settlement. The increase in earnings from aviation services was attributable to the favorable effects of higher volume, changes in business mix, increased operating efficiencies, lower impairment charges and the effects of past restructuring efforts, partly offset by higher subcontractor costs attributable to the significant increase in flight demand. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), which represented 65% of our combined retailing revenue in 2022. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 20% of the combined retailing revenues in 2022. K-53 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) Other retailing businesses include three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. 2022 versus 2021 Retailing group revenues in 2022 increased $337 million (1.8%) compared to 2021, reflecting an increase at BHA, partially offset by combined lower revenues from our other retailers. BHA’s revenues in 2022 increased 6.1% compared to 2021. Revenues from new and used retail vehicle sales increased 5.9% compared to 2021, attributable to higher average vehicle transaction prices, partly offset by a 4.5% decline in total retail units sold. New vehicle unit sales continue to be constrained by relatively low new vehicle production, although production gradually trended higher during 2022. Revenues from BHA’s service and repair business increased 11.1% versus 2021. Revenues of the home furnishings group declined 2.6%, while revenues of all other retailers declined 8.9%, primarily due to lower sales at Pampered Chef. Pre-tax earnings in 2022 of the retailing group decreased $85 million (4.7%) from 2021 and the pre-tax margin rate decreased 0.6 percentage points to 8.9%. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 18.4%, primarily due to increases in vehicle gross profit margins. BHA’s comparative vehicle gross profit margin rates began to accelerate during the second half of 2021, attributable to low available inventory. BHA’s vehicle gross margin rates peaked in the first half of 2022 and have since declined. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group decreased $233 million (23.2%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to reduced earnings from the home furnishings group, See’s Candies and Pampered Chef. 2021 versus 2020 Retailing group revenues in 2021 increased $3.1 billion (19.8%) compared to 2020. BHA’s revenues increased 19.0%, with vehicle sales, service and repair, and finance and service contract revenues each increasing versus 2020. Revenues from vehicle sales increased $1.7 billion (20.7%), primarily due to higher average selling prices, as well as a 2.7% increase in units sold. However, new vehicle unit sales in the second half of 2021 declined 18% compared to the second half of 2020, reflecting significant new vehicle supply shortages at manufacturers attributable to the global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Home furnishings group revenues increased 22.0%, attributable to higher consumer demand and higher average selling prices, driven by higher inventory and freight costs. Pre-tax earnings of the retailing group increased $781 million (76.0%) in 2021 from 2020 and the pre-tax margin rate increased 3.0 percentage points to 9.5%. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 47.5%, primarily due to increased vehicle sales margins and higher earnings from finance and service contract activities. In addition, earnings in 2021 benefitted from lower floorplan interest expense, attributable to significant declines in inventory levels, and from ongoing operating cost control efforts. Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased 67.6% in 2021 versus 2020, reflecting generally higher average gross margin rates and sales mix changes and cost control efforts, partly offset by higher personnel costs. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $321 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The initial effects of the pandemic in 2020 were severe for most of our other retailers due to the restricted operations at many of those businesses. Results in 2021 also benefitted from relatively strong consumer demand and the effects of restructuring efforts in 2020. K-54 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) McLane McLane Company, Inc. (“McLane”) operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised about 62% of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2022 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. 2022 versus 2021 Revenues of $53.2 billion in 2022 increased $3.8 billion (7.6%) compared to 2021. Revenues from the grocery business increased 4.4%, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 14.1% and 6.0%, respectively. Pre-tax earnings increased $41 million (17.8%) in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase reflected slightly higher gross margin rates in the grocery and foodservice businesses, partly offset by higher personnel costs, fuel expense and insurance costs. McLane’s grocery and food service operating results continue to be adversely affected by supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages, high fuel costs and high inventory costs. 2021 versus 2020 Revenues increased $2.6 billion (5.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues from the grocery business increased 1.5%, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 13.1% and 17.8%, respectively. The foodservice business was significantly impacted by pandemic-related restaurant closures in 2020. Pre-tax earnings decreased $21 million (8.4%) in 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease reflected significant increases in personnel, contract transportation and fuel costs, which more than offset the favorable impact of higher sales and slightly higher gross sales margins. McLane’s grocery and food service operations were significantly affected in 2021 by upstream supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages, which contributed to higher inventory costs, and disruptions in inventory availability. These upstream supply chain effects, together with the truck driver and warehouse personnel shortages that we experienced, adversely affected our customer service levels and reduced our operating efficiencies. In response, hiring and wage and benefits costs increased significantly in 2021. The increase in fuel costs was primarily attributable to significant increases in petroleum prices. Investment and Derivative Contract Gains (Losses) A summary of investment and derivative contract gains (losses) follows (dollars in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Investment gains (losses) $ (67,623 ) $ 77,576 $ 40,905 Derivative contract gains (losses) (276 ) 966 (159 ) Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests (67,899 ) 78,542 40,746 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (14,287 ) 16,202 9,155 Net earnings (loss) $ (53,612 ) $ 62,340 $ 31,591 Effective income tax rate 20.9 % 20.4 % 21.7 % K-55 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Investment and Derivative Contract Gains (Losses) (Continued) Investment gains (losses) Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Unrealized gains and losses also include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in non-U.S. issuers that are held by our U.S.-based subsidiaries. Pre-tax investment gains and losses included net unrealized losses of approximately $63.1 billion in 2022 and gains of approximately $76.4 billion in 2021 and $55.0 billion in 2020 attributable to changes in market prices of equity securities we held at the end of each year. In each year, we also recorded pre-tax gains and losses from market value changes during each year on equity securities sold during such year, including losses of $3.9 billion in 2022, gains of $1.0 billion in 2021 and losses of $14.0 billion in 2020. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold, which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $769 million in 2022, $3.6 billion in 2021 and $6.2 billion in 2020. We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains and losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative contract gains (losses) Derivative contract gains and losses include the changes in fair value of our few remaining equity index put option contract liabilities. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings. Substantially all of our contracts have expired and our exposure to loss in the future is insignificant. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings follows (in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Equity method earnings $ 1,528 $ 804 $ 615 Acquisition accounting expenses (681 ) (690 ) (783 ) Goodwill and intangible asset impairments — — (10,381 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (269 ) (305 ) (334 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes 1,263 955 (764 ) Other earnings 196 474 279 $ 2,037 $ 1,238 $ (11,368 ) After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Occidental Petroleum and Berkadia. Equity method earnings increased $724 million in 2022 versus 2021, primarily due to higher earnings from Kraft Heinz and Pilot and from the inclusion of Occidental Petroleum, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our after-tax earnings from Kraft Heinz were $550 million in 2022, $317 million in 2021 and $170 million in 2020, which included our after-tax share of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz of $157 million in 2022, $259 million in 2021 and $611 million in 2020. Our after-tax earnings from Occidental in 2022 were $258 million and our after-tax earnings from Pilot increased $267 million in 2022 compared to 2021. As a result of the increase in our ownership in Pilot to 80% on January 31, 2023, we discontinued the use of the equity method on that date. See Note 26 to the Consolidated financial Statements. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2020 included after-tax charges of $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets that were recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. See Other Critical Accounting Policies on page K-62 for additional details. K-56 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other (Continued) Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to the Berkshire and BHFC Euro, Great Britain Pound and Japanese Yen denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. In 2022, we recorded foreign currency exchange rate gains on these debt issues, due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, which reduced the U.S Dollar carrying value of the debt. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Other earnings consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and other unallocated income and income taxes. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2022 was $472.4 billion, a decrease of $33.8 billion since December 31, 2021. Net loss attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $22.8 billion and included after-tax losses on our investments of approximately $53.4 billion. Over each of the last three years, investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities produced significant volatility in our earnings. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $7.9 billion during 2022 to repurchase shares of its Class A and Class B common stock. At December 31, 2022, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $125.0 billion, which included $94.7 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental common stock) were $333.9 billion. During 2022, we paid cash of $67.9 billion to acquire equity securities and we received proceeds of $33.7 billion from sales of equity securities. On October 19, 2022, we acquired Alleghany Corporation for $11.5 billion, which held cash and investments of $19.7 billion as of the acquisition date. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot for approximately $8.2 billion, which was based on Pilot’s unaudited earnings in 2022 and its net debt as of December 31, 2022 and is subject to post-closing adjustments following the completion of the audit of Pilot’s 2022 consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated borrowings at December 31, 2022 were $122.7 billion, of which approximately 94% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. During 2022, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $12.7 billion in the aggregate and paid approximately $3.9 billion of maturing senior debt. Expected principal and interest payments related to our consolidated borrowings in each of the next five years are (in billions): $17.4 in 2023; $10.4 in 2024; $11.0 in 2025; $8.7 in 2026; and $8.1 in 2027. Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 was $21.4 billion, substantially unchanged from December 31, 2021. In 2022, Berkshire issued an aggregate ¥243.5 billion (approximately $1.94 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.8%. Berkshire’s borrowings decreased $1.4 billion during 2022 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on its non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were approximately $25.1 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $7.3 billion since December 31, 2021. Senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, were approximately $17.9 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $4.8 billion since December 31, 2021, reflecting the issuance of debt, repayments of maturing debt ($775 million) and reductions in the carrying value of non-U.S. denominated debt due to foreign currency exchange rate changes ($300 million). In 2022, BHFC issued $4.5 billion of senior notes maturing in 2027, 2032 and 2052 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and €1.25 billion (approximately $1.4 billion) of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. Subsidiary borrowings as of December 31, 2022 included approximately $2.3 billion attributable to Alleghany and its subsidiaries. K-57 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of $233 million from December 31, 2021. In 2022, BNSF issued $1.0 billion of 4.45% debentures due in 2053 and repaid approximately $900 million of term debt. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $52.8 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $1.0 billion since December 31, 2021. In 2022, BHE issued $1.0 billion of 4.6% senior notes due in 2053. During 2022, BHE subsidiaries issued approximately $3.0 billion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% at December 31, 2022 and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2053. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. In each of the past three years, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows between $37 billion and $40 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $15.5 billion in 2022, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $11.0 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast capital expenditures of these two operations will approximate $13.7 billion in 2023. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“the 2022 act”) was signed into law. The 2022 act contains numerous provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax on “adjusted financial statement income”, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The provisions of the 2022 act become effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. On December 27, 2022, the IRS and Department of Treasury issued initial guidance for taxpayers subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. The guidance addresses several, but not all, issues that needed clarification. The IRS and Department of Treasury intend to release additional guidance in the future. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the Act as more guidance becomes available. We currently do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next five years are (in billions): $1.8 in 2023; $1.6 in 2024; $1.4 in 2025; $1.3 in 2026; and $1.5 in 2027. We are also obligated to pay claims arising from our property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $143 billion at December 31, 2022. We currently forecast claim payments in 2023 of approximately $35 billion with respect to claims occurring prior to 2023. Additionally, we estimate net payments of approximately $2 billion in 2023 for life, health and annuity benefits under contracts. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of December 31, 2022, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF, aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets and certain raw materials purchase commitments. We estimate future payments associated with these contracts over the next five years of approximately $24 billion, including $12 billion in 2023. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significant degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2022 follows. K-58 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for loss events occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment and settlement process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities, which may require significant judgments and assumptions. As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails. Our consolidated claim liabilities, including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance contracts, as of December 31, 2022 were approximately $143 billion, of which 78% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid losses of these businesses follows. GEICO GEICO predominantly writes private passenger automobile insurance. As of December 31, 2022, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses were $24.8 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $23.8 billion. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies. Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2022, case development liabilities averaged approximately 38% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities. IBNR claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2021 were reduced by $653 million during 2022, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2022 reflect the most recent frequency and severity estimates. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated. With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average claims severities will change by at least one percentage point from the projected severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2022. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $245 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. K-59 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through the NICO, General Re and TransRe Groups. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2022 follows (in millions). Property Casualty Total Reported case liabilities $ 8,314 $ 12,136 $ 20,450 IBNR liabilities 9,084 21,041 30,125 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 17,398 33,177 50,575 Reinsurance recoverable 787 1,439 2,226 Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 16,611 $ 31,738 $ 48,349 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we judgmentally allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Reinsurance contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess contracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes currently recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR loss estimates. Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower than primary insurers. In the U.S., client reporting is generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. To the extent that reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, further delays in claims reporting may occur. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage and other reasons. As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain certain internal procedures to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. We believe there are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance assumed requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. We generally rely on the ceding companies’ reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2022, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $650 million for certain legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates. K-60 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, we use a variety of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of historical data, loss development patterns, industry data and other benchmarks. The estimate of the IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories: Paid and incurred loss development methods – These methods consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices, the frequency of client company claim reviews, policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), loss trends and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns. Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods – These methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses. Frequency and severity methods – These methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses. Additional analysis – In some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis, determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgment on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events. Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications. In 2022, certain workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $114 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1 billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. For other casualty losses, other than asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, we reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ events by approximately $650 million in 2022. For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $980 million, although outcomes of greater than or less than $980 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business. The change in estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts was not significant in 2022. Net liabilities for such claims were approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2022. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. K-61 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities associated with our retroactive reinsurance contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-tails to be very long. At December 31, 2022, gross unpaid losses were $35.4 billion and deferred charges were $9.9 billion. Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $52 billion. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our estimated gross liability. We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expectations are revealed. Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.1 billion at December 31, 2022. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities. We increased estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $86 million in 2022. In 2022, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $2.4 billion with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts. In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charges, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortize deferred charges, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments and the effects of the adjustments are included in pre-tax earnings. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2022, we estimate that amortization expense in 2023 will approximate $860 million. Other Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $78.1 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.3 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more likely than not there has been an impairment. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss. K-62 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) As of December 31, 2022, we concluded it was more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The fair value estimates of reporting units are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reporting units businesses, as well as other assumptions concerning the long-term economic performance of the reporting units, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates can be subject to wide variations. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2022, the estimated fair values of six reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). Our estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $31.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $30.3 billion by 4.0%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the five other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $4.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $4.1 billion by 9.9%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.4 billion. In the second quarter of 2020, we quantitively reevaluated goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, and most significantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million, of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC. Prior to the reevaluation, the carrying value of PCC-related goodwill was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, the carrying value of PCC-related indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of these amounts were recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of PCC in 2016. The initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers were particularly severe. At that time, we considered several factors in our reevaluation, including but not limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand, employment levels and aircraft orders, announcements by manufacturers of reduced aircraft production and the actions we were taking to restructure operations. Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing for impairments. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Equity Price Risk Equity securities represent the most significant portion of our consolidated investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each company. Historically, equity investments have been concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2022, approximately 75% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in five companies. We often hold our equity securities for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. K-63 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Equity Price Risk (Continued) For the past several years, we were also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. However, substantially all of the contracts written to date have expired. The following table summarizes our significant assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

Interest Rate Risk We may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit ratings in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks and we do not attempt to match maturities of assets and liabilities. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. K-64 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Interest Rate Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2022 and 2021. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and do not use derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risks in a meaningful way. K-65 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Foreign Currency Risk (Continued) Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and service subsidiaries. A portion of our financial statement translation-related impact from changes in foreign currency rates is recorded in other comprehensive income. In addition, we include gains or losses from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in net earnings related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities of Berkshire and its U.S.-based subsidiaries. A summary of these gains (losses), after-tax, for each of the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 follows (in millions). 2022 2021 Non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings $ 1,263 $ 955 Net liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts included in net earnings 263 58 Foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income (2,045 ) (1,021 ) Commodity Price Risk Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We generally do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risks to any significant degree. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page K-67.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and minority interests and are in millions. 2008 2007 2006 Insurance – underwriting $ 1,805 $ 2,184 $ 2,485 Insurance – investment income 3,497 3,510 3,120 Utilities and energy 1,704 1,114 885 Manufacturing, service and retailing 2,283 2,353 2,131 Finance and financial products 479 632 732 Other (129 ) (159 ) (47 ) Investment and derivative gains/losses (4,645 ) 3,579 1,709 Net earnings $ 4,994 $ 13,213 $ 11,015 Berkshire’s operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by Berkshire’s corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Berkshire’s corporate office management participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. During 2008, a series of crises occurred in the U.S. financial and capital markets systems, as well as in the credit and housing markets. These conditions accelerated into an economic recession, as evidenced by declining consumer confidence, lower consumer spending, bankruptcies and significant job losses. The declining economic conditions worsened over the last half of 2008 and in the fourth quarter in particular. Equity and debt markets have seen major declines in market prices on a worldwide basis as well, which have negatively impacted the fair value of Berkshire’s investments and derivative contracts. During 2008, the net after-tax unrealized gains in Berkshire’s equity investment portfolio declined by approximately $13.9 billion. In addition, during 2008, after-tax investment and derivative losses of $4.6 billion were included in earnings and primarily related to non-cash fair value adjustments of certain derivative contract liabilities and non-cash other-than-temporary impairment charges with respect to certain investments offset to a degree by net realized gains from investment sales. Berkshire’s insurance, manufacturing, service, retailing and finance and financial products businesses were impacted by the recession in different ways and to varying degrees. Operating results in 2008 for most of Berkshire’s manufacturing, service and retailing businesses were generally lower than in 2007. It is likely that the current economic conditions will persist through 2009 and in to 2010 before meaningful improvements become evident. Berkshire’s operating companies have taken and will continue to take cost reduction actions in response to the current economic situation, including curtailing production, reducing capital expenditures, closing facilities and reducing employment to partially compensate for the declines in demand for goods and services. Berkshire has historically attempted to manage its financial condition such that it can weather cyclical economic conditions. Management believes that the economic franchises of Berkshire’s business operations will remain intact and that operating results will ultimately return to more normal historical levels. Insurance—Underwriting Berkshire engages in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks. In primary insurance activities, Berkshire subsidiaries assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, Berkshire subsidiaries assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Berkshire’s principal insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Through General Re, Berkshire also reinsures life and health risks. Berkshire’s management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing, with limited exceptions, is the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, Berkshire evaluates performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income. 28 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Periodic underwriting results can be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. See the Critical Accounting Policies section of this discussion for information concerning the loss reserve estimation process. In addition, the timing and amount of catastrophe losses produce significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. Berkshire’s property and casualty reinsurance operations benefited from relatively minor levels of catastrophe losses in 2007 and 2006. During 2008, Berkshire’s underwriting results include estimated losses of approximately $900 million from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. The impact on earnings of these losses was substantially offset by unrealized foreign currency transaction gains during the last half of 2008 that arose from the valuation of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities as a result of the significant strengthening of the U.S. Dollar. A key marketing strategy followed by all of the insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of Berkshire’s insurance businesses was approximately $51 billion at December 31, 2008. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers. Additional information regarding Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance operations follows. A summary follows of underwriting results from Berkshire’s insurance businesses for the past three years.

GEICO policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet, over the telephone or through the mail. This is a significant element in GEICO’s strategy to be a low-cost insurer. In addition, GEICO strives to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICO’s underwriting results for the past three years are summarized below. Dollars are in millions. 2008 2007 2006 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 12,741 $ 11,931 $ 11,303 Premiums earned $ 12,479 100.0 $ 11,806 100.0 $ 11,055 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 9,332 74.8 8,523 72.2 7,749 70.1 Underwriting expenses 2,231 17.9 2,170 18.4 1,992 18.0 Total losses and expenses 11,563 92.7 10,693 90.6 9,741 88.1 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 916 $ 1,113 $ 1,314 29 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Premiums earned in 2008 increased 5.7% over 2007, reflecting an 8.2% increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force partially offset by lower average premiums per policy. Average premiums per policy declined during 2007 but leveled off in 2008. The weakening economy could result in downward pressure on average premiums per policy in 2009 to the extent that consumers raise deductibles and reduce coverages to save money. Policies-in-force over the last twelve months increased 6.6% in the preferred risk auto line and increased 13.1% in the standard and nonstandard auto lines. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2008 increased 2.0% compared to 2007. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2008 were 665,000 higher than at December 31, 2007. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2008 increased 9.5% over 2007. The loss ratio was 74.8% in 2008 versus 72.2% in 2007. Incurred losses from catastrophe events for 2008 were $87 million compared to $34 million for 2007. Overall, the increase in the loss ratio reflected higher average claim severities and lower average premiums per policy, partially offset by lower average claims frequencies. Claims frequencies in 2008 for physical damage coverages decreased in the seven to nine percent range from 2007 and frequencies for injury coverages decreased in the four to six percent range. Physical damage severities in 2008 increased in the six to eight percent range and injury severities increased in the five to eight percent range over 2007. Underwriting expenses in 2008 increased $61 million (2.8%) over 2007. Policy acquisition expenses increased 8.5% in 2008 to $1,508 million, primarily due to increased advertising and policy issuance costs. The increase in policy acquisition expenses was partially offset by lower other underwriting expenses, including lower interest on deferred compensation liabilities. Premiums earned in 2007 increased 6.8% over 2006, due to higher numbers of policies-in-force, partially offset by lower premiums per policy as a result of overall lower rates. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2007 increased 10.0% over 2006, reflecting the aforementioned decline in average premiums per policy. In 2007, claims frequencies for physical damage coverages increased in the two to four percent range over 2006 while frequencies for injury coverages decreased in the three to five percent range. Physical damage severities increased in the second half of 2007 at an annualized rate of two to four percent. Injury severities also increased in the latter part of 2007 at an annualized rate of three to six percent. General Re General Re conducts a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. Property and casualty reinsurance is written in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Cologne Re (based in Germany) and other affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written worldwide through Cologne Re. General Re strives to generate underwriting gains in essentially all of its product lines. Underwriting performance is not evaluated based upon market share and underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Re’s underwriting results are summarized for the past three years in the following table. Amounts are in millions. Premiums written Premiums earned Pre-tax underwritinggain 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Property/casualty $ 3,383 $ 3,478 $ 3,581 $ 3,434 $ 3,614 $ 3,711 $ 163 $ 475 $ 373 Life/health 2,588 2,479 2,368 2,580 2,462 2,364 179 80 153 $ 5,971 $ 5,957 $ 5,949 $ 6,014 $ 6,076 $ 6,075 $ 342 $ 555 $ 526 30 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) General Re (Continued) Property/casualty Premiums written in 2008 declined 2.7% from 2007, which declined 2.9% versus 2006. Premiums written in 2008 included $205 million with respect to a reinsurance-to-close transaction that increased General Re’s economic interest in the runoff of Lloyd’s Syndicate 435’s 2000 year of account from 39% to 100%. A similar transaction in 2007 generated $114 million of premiums written and increased General Re’s economic interest in the runoff of Lloyd’s Syndicate 435’s 2001 year of account from 60% to 100%. Neither of the reinsurance-to-close transactions had any impact on net underwriting results because premiums earned were offset by corresponding increases to loss reserves and losses incurred. There was no similar transaction in 2006. Premiums earned in 2008 declined 5.0% from 2007, which declined 2.6% from 2006. Excluding the effects of the previously mentioned reinsurance-to-close transactions and exchange rates, premiums earned declined 8.2% in 2008 compared to 2007 and 10.1% in 2007 compared to 2006. The overall comparative declines in written and earned premiums reflect continued underwriting discipline by declining to accept business where pricing is considered inadequate with respect to the risk. Competitive conditions currently prevailing within the industry could lead to continued declines in business written in 2009. Pre-tax underwriting results in 2008 included $275 million in underwriting gains from property business partially offset by $112 million in underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business. The property business produced underwriting losses of $120 million for the 2008 accident year, offset by $395 million of gains from favorable run-off of prior years’ losses. The current accident year results include $174 million of catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and $56 million of catastrophe losses from European storms. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual losses produce significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. The pre-tax underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business in 2008 included $117 million of workers’ compensation loss reserve discount accretion and retroactive reinsurance deferred charge amortization, offset in part by favorable run-off in other casualty lines. The casualty results were adversely impacted by legal costs incurred in connection with the ongoing regulatory investigations of finite reinsurance. Pre-tax underwriting results in 2007 included $519 million in underwriting gains from property business, partially offset by $44 million in underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business. The property business produced underwriting gains of $90 million for the 2007 accident year and $429 million from favorable run-off of prior years’ losses. The pre-tax underwriting losses from casualty business in 2007 included $120 million of loss reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, as well as legal costs associated with the finite reinsurance investigations. These charges were largely offset by underwriting gains in other casualty business. Pre-tax underwriting results in 2006 included $708 million in underwriting gains from property business, partially offset by $335 million in underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business, which included legal and estimated settlement costs associated with the finite reinsurance regulatory investigations. The 2006 property results benefited from a lack of catastrophe losses and favorable runoff of prior years’ claim reserves. The underwriting losses from casualty business in 2006 included $137 million in reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, increases in prior years’ workers’ compensation reserves of $103 million and increases in asbestos and environmental reserves. Life/health Premiums earned in 2008 increased 4.8% over 2007, which increased 4.1% over 2006. Adjusting for the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, premiums earned increased 2.2% over 2007 which were relatively unchanged when compared to 2006. The increase in premiums earned in 2008 was primarily from life business in North America. Underwriting results for the life/health operations produced pre-tax underwriting gains in each of the past three years driven by gains from the life business primarily as a result of lower mortality rates. 31 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) underwrites excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages for insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG’s business includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and excess direct and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual discrete property risks referred to as individual risk. Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Other multi-line refers to other business written on both a quota-share and excess basis, participations in and contracts with Lloyd’s syndicates as well as property, aviation and workers’ compensation programs. BHRG’s underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in millions. Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain/loss 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Catastrophe and individual risk $ 955 $ 1,577 $ 2,196 $ 776 $ 1,477 $ 1,588 Retroactive reinsurance 204 7,708 146 (414 ) (375 ) (173 ) Other multi-line 3,923 2,617 2,634 962 325 243 $ 5,082 $ 11,902 $ 4,976 $ 1,324 $ 1,427 $ 1,658 Catastrophe and individual risk contracts may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification, often several hundred million dollars and occasionally in excess of $1 billion, and cover catastrophe risks (such as hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters) or other property risks (such as aviation and aerospace, commercial multi-peril or terrorism). The timing and magnitude of losses produce extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results of BHRG’s catastrophe and individual risk business. BHRG does not cede these risks to mitigate volatility as management accepts such potential volatility provided that the long-term prospect of achieving underwriting profits is reasonable. Premiums earned from catastrophe and individual risk contracts in 2008 declined 39% from 2007, which decreased 28% versus 2006. Catastrophe and individual risk premiums written were approximately $1.1 billion in 2008, $1.2 billion in 2007 and $2.4 billion in 2006. The decreases in premium volume were principally attributable to increased industry capacity for catastrophe reinsurance, which has produced increased price competition and fewer opportunities to write business at prices considered adequate by BHRG management. The level of catastrophe and individual risk business written in a given period will vary significantly based upon market conditions and management’s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. During 2008, Berkshire entered into a contract under which it received a payment of $224 million and agreed to purchase, under certain conditions, up to $4 billion of revenue bonds issued by the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund Finance Corporation. Berkshire’s obligation was conditioned upon, among other things, the occurrence of a specified amount of hurricane losses in Florida during a period that expired on December 31, 2008. The minimum amount of hurricane losses required to trigger Berkshire’s acquisition of the bonds was not met and the consideration received was earned as of December 31, 2008 and is included in the underwriting results of the catastrophe and individual risk business. Underwriting results in 2008 for the catastrophe and individual risk business also included approximately $270 million of estimated losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. The underwriting results from catastrophe and individual risk business in 2007 and 2006 reflected no significant losses from catastrophe events occurring in those years. In 2006, BHRG incurred losses of approximately $200 million attributable to prior years’ events, primarily Hurricane Wilma which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. Retroactive policies normally provide very large, but limited indemnification of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events that are expected to be paid over long periods of time. Underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance include the amortization of deferred charges established on the contracts. At the inception of a contract, deferred charges represent the difference between the premium received and the estimated ultimate losses payable. Deferred charges are amortized over the estimated claims payment period using the interest method. The amortization charges are based on the estimated timing and amount of loss payments and are recorded as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. Premiums earned from retroactive reinsurance in 2007 included $7.1 billion from the Equitas reinsurance agreement which became effective on March 30, 2007. See Note 13 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Otherwise, 32 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) premiums earned from retroactive contracts were relatively minor over the past three years. Unamortized deferred charges of BHRG’s retroactive contracts (including the Equitas contract) were $3.7 billion at December 31, 2008 and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2007. Gross unpaid losses under retroactive contracts were approximately $16.6 billion at December 31, 2008 and $17.3 billion at December 31, 2007. Underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance policies in each year were primarily attributable to recurring deferred charge amortization. Underwriting losses from retroactive policies in 2007 included deferred charge amortization of $156 million on contracts written in 2007 (primarily the Equitas contract). Underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance in 2006 were net of gains of approximately $145 million which primarily derived from contracts that were commuted or amended during that year. Other multi-line premiums earned in 2008 increased $1.31 billion (50%) over 2007. Premiums earned in 2008 included $1.83 billion from a quota-share contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. and its major property/casualty affiliates (“Swiss Re”) that became effective January 1, 2008. Under the agreement, BHRG assumes a 20% quota-share of the premiums and related losses and expenses on substantially all property/casualty risks of Swiss Re written over the five year period ending December 31, 2012. BHRG’s written premium under this agreement in 2008 was $2.65 billion. Actual premiums assumed over the remainder of the five year period could vary significantly depending on Swiss Re’s response to market conditions and opportunities that arise over the contract term. Excluding the premiums from the Swiss Re quota-share contract, other multi-line premiums earned in 2008 declined 20% versus 2007 principally attributable to lower premium volume from workers’ compensation programs. Other multi-line business produced a pre-tax underwriting gain of $962 million in 2008. This gain included $930 million of foreign currency transaction gains (including approximately $615 million in the fourth quarter) arising from the conversion of certain reinsurance liabilities denominated and settled in foreign currencies (primarily the U.K. Pound Sterling and the Euro) into U.S. Dollars as of the balance sheet date. The value of these currencies versus the U.S. Dollar generally increased over the past several years resulting in accumulated liabilities and transaction losses. Over the last half of 2008, these currencies declined sharply versus the U.S. Dollar, resulting in gains that exceeded the previously recorded losses. Excluding the effects of the currency gains/losses, other multi-line business produced a pre-tax underwriting gain of $32 million in 2008 compared to $435 million in 2007. Pre-tax underwriting results in 2008 included approximately $435 million of estimated catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. There were no significant catastrophe losses in 2007, which also benefited from relatively low property loss ratios and favorable loss experience on workers’ compensation business. Other multi-line premiums earned in 2007 were relatively unchanged from 2006, reflecting significant increases in property business and significant decreases in casualty excess reinsurance. In addition, as of the beginning of 2007, the management of certain workers’ compensation business was transferred to the Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and the related underwriting results have been excluded from BHRG since that date. In December 2007, BHRG formed a monoline financial guarantee insurance company, Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corporation (“BHAC”). BHAC commenced operations during the first quarter of 2008 and is licensed in 49 states. As of December 31, 2008, BHAC had approximately $1 billion in capital and has received the highest rating available from two credit rating agencies. BHRG is pursuing opportunities to write financial guarantee insurance on municipal bonds. In its first year of operation, BHAC produced $595 million of written premiums. The impact of this new business on 2008 underwriting results was minimal, since the coverage periods related to the insured bonds extend over 40 years into the future. In January 2009, BHRG agreed to cover certain Swiss Re entities for adverse loss development of its property and casualty loss reserves up to 5 billion Swiss Francs in excess of its December 31, 2008 loss reserves less 2 billion Swiss Francs. BHRG will receive a premium of 2 billion Swiss Francs for providing this coverage. 33 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group Berkshire’s primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses that principally write liability coverages for commercial accounts. These businesses include: Medical Protective Corporation (“MedPro”), a provider of professional liability insurance to physicians, dentists and other healthcare providers; National Indemnity Company’s primary group operation (“NICO Primary Group”), a writer of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as “Homestate” operations, providers of standard commercial multi-line insurance; Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers’ compensation solutions; and BoatU.S., (acquired in August 2007) which writes insurance for owners of boats and small watercraft. Earned premiums by the primary insurance businesses were $1,950 million in 2008, $1,999 million in 2007 and $1,858 million in 2006. Roughly 33% of the premiums earned in each year were from MedPro. In 2008, premiums earned by the NICO Primary Group declined by approximately 30%, which was partially offset by increased premiums earned from the Homestate operations and BoatU.S. Pre-tax underwriting gains as percentages of premiums earned were approximately 11% in 2008, 14% in 2007 and 18% in 2006. The decline in underwriting gains in 2008 from 2007 reflected declines in underwriting gains from the NICO Primary Group and Homestate operations, which were primarily due to less favorable loss reserve development of prior years’ occurrences as well as relatively higher losses for current year occurrences. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of the net investment income of Berkshire’s insurance operations for the past three years follows. Amounts are in millions. 2008 2007 2006 Investment income before income taxes and minority interests $ 4,722 $ 4,758 $ 4,316 Income taxes and minority interests 1,225 1,248 1,196 Investment income after income taxes and minority interests $ 3,497 $ 3,510 $ 3,120 Investment income consists of interest earned on cash equivalents and fixed maturity investments and dividends earned on equity investments. Pre-tax investment income earned in 2008 was relatively unchanged from 2007. Investment income earned in 2007 increased $442 million (10%) over 2006. The increase in 2007 over 2006 reflected increased invested assets, higher short-term interest rates in the United States and increased dividend rates on certain equity investments. In 2008, dividend income increased $534 million, reflecting increased investments in equity securities and increased dividend rates with respect to certain securities. The increase in dividends earned was offset by a decline in interest earned, reflecting lower levels of related fixed maturity investments and generally lower interest rates applicable to cash equivalents and short-term investments. In October 2008, Berkshire subsidiaries acquired the Wrigley, Goldman Sachs and General Electric securities for an aggregate cost of $14.5 billion. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and dividends from these securities will be approximately $1.4 billion per annum, which is substantially greater than earnings currently expected from short-term investments. 34 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) A summary of investments held in Berkshire’s insurance businesses follows.

In 2007 and 2006, investments in Burlington Northern and Moody’s are included in equity securities. Fixed maturity investments as of December 31, 2008 were as follows. Amounts are in millions. Amortizedcost Unrealizedgains/losses Fairvalue U.S. Treasury, government corporations and agencies $ 2,100 $ 121 $ 2,221 States, municipalities and political subdivisions 3,065 237 3,302 Foreign governments 9,066 284 9,350 Corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, investment grade 4,826 68 4,894 Corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, non-investment grade 5,392 (1,195 ) 4,197 Mortgage-backed securities 2,986 (18 ) 2,968 $ 27,435 $ (503 ) $ 26,932 All U.S. government obligations are rated AAA by the major rating agencies and approximately 90% of all state, municipal and political subdivisions, foreign government obligations and mortgage-backed securities were rated AA or higher. Non-investment grade securities represent securities that are rated below BBB- or Baa3. Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $58 billion at December 31, 2008, $59 billion at December 31, 2007 and $51 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in float in 2007 was principally due to the Equitas reinsurance transaction. The cost of float, as represented by the ratio of underwriting gain or loss to average float, was negative for the last three years, as Berkshire’s insurance businesses generated underwriting gains in each year. 35 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) Revenues and earnings of MidAmerican for each of the past three years are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 MidAmerican Energy Company $ 4,742 $ 4,325 $ 3,519 $ 425 $ 412 $ 348 PacifiCorp 4,558 4,319 2,971 703 692 356 Natural gas pipelines 1,221 1,088 972 595 473 376 U.K. utilities 1,001 1,114 961 339 337 338 Real estate brokerage 1,147 1,511 1,724 (45 ) 42 74 Other 1,302 271 497 1,278 130 245 $ 13,971 $ 12,628 $ 10,644 Earnings before corporate interest and taxes 3,295 2,086 1,737 Interest, other than to Berkshire (332 ) (312 ) (261 ) Interest on Berkshire junior debt (111 ) (108 ) (134 ) Income taxes and minority interests ** (1,002 ) (477 ) (426 ) Net earnings $ 1,850 $ 1,189 $ 916 Earnings applicable to Berkshire * $ 1,704 $ 1,114 $ 885 Debt owed to others at December 31 19,145 19,002 16,946 Debt owed to Berkshire at December 31 1,087 821 1,055 * Includes interest earned by Berkshire (net of related income taxes). ** Net of $58 million deferred income tax benefit in 2007 as a result of the reduction in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate from 30% to 28% which was enacted during the third quarter of 2007 and became effective in 2008. Berkshire currently owns an 88.2% (87.4% diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (“MidAmerican”), an international energy company. MidAmerican’s domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of two regulated utility companies (MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and PacifiCorp) serving over 3 million retail customers and two interstate natural gas pipeline companies (Northern Natural Gas and Kern River) with approximately 17,000 miles of pipeline in operation and design capacity of about 7.0 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. In the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), electricity distribution subsidiaries serve about 3.8 million electricity end users. The rates that MidAmerican’s utilities, electricity distribution and natural gas pipeline businesses may charge customers for energy and other services are generally subject to regulatory approval. Rates are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital. To the extent these operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, MidAmerican’s other businesses include a diversified portfolio of independent power projects and the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States. MEC’s revenues in 2008 increased $417 million (10%) over 2007. The increase reflects (1) increased regulated natural gas revenues from cost based price increases that are largely passed on to customers, (2) increased non-regulated gas revenues due primarily to higher prices and, to a lesser degree, increased volume and (3) increased wholesale regulated electricity revenues driven by volume increases. Earnings before corporate interest and income taxes (“EBIT”) of MEC in 2008 increased $13 million (3%) versus 2007, resulting primarily from higher operating margins on wholesale regulated electricity and slightly higher margins from regulated gas sales, partially offset by increased interest expense and lower miscellaneous income. PacifiCorp’s revenues in 2008 increased $239 million (6%) over 2007. The increase was primarily related to higher retail revenues due to regulator approved rate increases as well as increased customer growth and usage. PacifiCorp’s EBIT in 2008 increased $11 million (2%) versus 2007, as higher revenues were substantially offset by increased fuel costs and interest expense. 36 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) (Continued) Natural gas pipelines revenues in 2008 increased $133 million (12%) over 2007. The increase reflected increased transportation revenue as a result of stronger market conditions in the Northern Natural Gas system, the impact of system expansion projects and changes related to the Kern River system current rate proceeding. EBIT in 2008 of the gas pipeline businesses increased $122 million (26%) over 2007. The increase in EBIT reflects the impact of increased revenues. U.K. utility revenues in 2008 declined $113 million (10%) versus 2007 primarily from the effect of the significant strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the U.K. Pound Sterling over the second half of 2008. EBIT in 2008 was relatively unchanged from 2007 as the revenue decline was offset primarily by lower operating costs and interest expense. Real estate brokerage revenues in 2008 declined $364 million (24%) compared to 2007 due to significant declines in transaction volume as well as lower average home sales prices. Real estate brokerage activities generated a loss before interest and taxes of $45 million in 2008 versus EBIT of $42 million in 2007. The loss in 2008 reflected the continuing weak U.S. housing markets. In the fourth quarter of 2008, EBIT from other activities included a gain of $917 million from MidAmerican’s investments in Constellation Energy as well as a fee of $175 million received as a result of the termination of the planned acquisition of Constellation Energy. EBIT from other activities in 2006 included gains of $117 million primarily from the disposal of equity securities. There were no significant securities gains in 2007. MEC’s revenues in 2007 increased $806 million (23%) over 2006. MEC’s non-regulated energy sales in 2007 exceeded 2006 by $597 million primarily due to improved market opportunities. MEC’s regulated wholesale and retail electricity sales in 2007 exceeded 2006 by $155 million, which reflected the impact of new generating assets and improved opportunities in wholesale markets as well as higher retail demand due to warmer temperatures and increases in the number of retail customers. EBIT of MEC in 2007 increased $64 million (18%), reflecting the margins on the increases in regulated and non-regulated energy sales, partially offset by higher facilities operating and maintenance costs. PacifiCorp’s revenues in 2007 increased $1,348 million (45%) and EBIT increased $336 million (94%) versus 2006. Revenues and EBIT of PacifiCorp for 2006 are included beginning as of the acquisition date (March 21, 2006). In 2007, PacifiCorp’s revenues and EBIT were favorably impacted by regulatory-approved rate increases and higher customer usage in retail markets, as well as increased margins on wholesale electricity sales, partially offset by higher fuel and purchased power costs. Revenues from natural gas pipelines in 2007 increased $116 million (12%) over 2006 due primarily to favorable market conditions and because revenues in 2006 reflected the impact of estimated rate case refunds to customers. EBIT in 2007 from natural gas pipelines increased $97 million (26%) over 2006 mainly due to comparatively higher revenue and lower depreciation due to expected changes in depreciation rates in connection with a current rate proceeding. Revenues from U.K. utilities in 2007 increased over the comparable 2006 period primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.K. Pound Sterling versus the U.S. Dollar as well as higher gas production and electricity distribution revenues. EBIT from the U.K. utilities in 2007 was essentially unchanged compared to 2006 as higher maintenance and depreciation costs and the write-off of unsuccessful gas exploration costs offset the impact of higher revenues. Revenues and EBIT in 2007 from real estate brokerage declined 12% and 43%, respectively, compared to 2006, primarily due to significantly lower transaction volume as a result of the slowdown in U.S. residential real estate activity. 37 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of Berkshire’s manufacturing, service and retailing businesses for each of the past three years follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Marmon $ 5,529 $ — $ — $ 733 $ — $ — McLane Company 29,852 28,079 25,693 276 232 229 Shaw Industries 5,052 5,373 5,834 205 436 594 Other manufacturing 14,127 14,459 11,988 1,675 2,037 1,756 Other service * 8,435 7,792 5,811 971 968 658 Retailing 3,104 3,397 3,334 163 274 289 $ 66,099 $ 59,100 $ 52,660 Pre-tax earnings $ 4,023 $ 3,947 $ 3,526 Income taxes and minority interests 1,740 1,594 1,395 $ 2,283 $ 2,353 $ 2,131 * Management evaluates the results of NetJets using accounting standards for recognition of revenue and planned major maintenance expenses that were generally accepted when Berkshire acquired NetJets but are no longer acceptable due to subsequent changes adopted by the FASB. Revenues and pre-tax earnings for the other service businesses shown above reflect these prior revenue and expense recognition methods. Revenues shown above exceeded the amounts reported in Berkshire’s Consolidated Financial Statements by $130 million in 2008, $709 million in 2007 and $781 million in 2006. Pre-tax earnings in this table exceeded (was less than) the amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements by ($4 million) in 2008, $48 million in 2007 and $79 million in 2006. Marmon Berkshire acquired a 60% interest in Marmon Holdings, Inc. (“Marmon”) on March 18, 2008. During the second quarter of 2008, Berkshire acquired additional shares and currently has a 63.6% interest. Marmon’s operating results are included in Berkshire’s consolidated results and in the preceding table from the date of the initial acquisition. Marmon consists of approximately 130 manufacturing and service businesses that operate independently within 11 diverse business sectors. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional description of Marmon’s operations. For the twelve months ending December 31, 2008, Marmon’s consolidated revenues and operating income were $6,960 million and $977 million, respectively, compared to $6,934 million and $946 million, respectively in 2007. McLane Company McLane Company, Inc., (“McLane”) is a wholesale distributor of grocery and non-food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. McLane’s business is marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins. McLane’s revenues of $29,852 million in 2008 increased $1,773 million (6%) compared to 2007 which increased $2,386 million (9%) compared to 2006. The revenue increases in both 2008 and 2007 reflected additional grocery and foodservice customers as well as manufacturer price increases and state excise tax increases. Pre-tax earnings in 2008 increased $44 million over 2007, which was relatively unchanged from 2006. The increase in 2008 reflected the increased sales and to a lesser degree a slight increase in gross margins. The gross margin rate was 5.91% in 2008 compared to 5.79% in 2007. The comparative increase in the gross margin rate reflected price changes related to certain categories of grocery products and the impact of a heavy liquids sales surcharge. Operating expenses in 2008 as a percentage of revenues were relatively unchanged compared to 2007. Approximately one-third of McLane’s annual revenues are from Wal-Mart. A curtailment of purchasing by Wal-Mart could have a material adverse impact on McLane’s earnings. Shaw Industries Shaw Industries (“Shaw”) is the world’s largest manufacturer of tufted broadloom carpets and is a full-service flooring company. Shaw revenues of $5,052 million in 2008 declined $321 million (6%) compared to 2007. The revenue decrease was primarily due to a reduction in year-to-date residential carpet sales volume, partially offset by higher average selling prices and 38 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Shaw Industries (Continued) revenues from recent acquisitions. The decrease in residential carpet volume in 2008 reflected the significant downturn in residential real estate activity that began in 2006 and was exacerbated by the credit crises during 2007 and 2008. In 2008, pre-tax earnings declined $231 million (53%) to $205 million. The decline was attributable to both lower sales volume and higher product costs. Increases in petrochemical based raw material costs along with reduced manufacturing efficiencies caused the product cost increase. The gross margin rate for 2008 was approximately 3 percentage points lower as compared to 2007. Pre-tax earnings in 2008 also included $52 million of charges in the fourth quarter related to asset writedowns and plant closure costs. To offset the impact of rising raw material and production costs, Shaw instituted multiple sales price increases in 2008 and closed certain manufacturing facilities. Management expects residential real estate activity and, as a result, Shaw’s sales volume to remain weak during 2009. Revenues of $5,373 million in 2007 declined $461 million (8%) compared to 2006. In 2007, carpet volume decreased 10% versus 2006 due to lower sales in residential markets, partially offset by a modest increase in commercial market volume. In 2007, pre-tax earnings decreased $158 million (27%) compared to 2006. The decline reflects the aforementioned lower sales volume and higher product costs. These factors combined to produce declines in gross margin dollars in 2007 of approximately 17% versus 2006. Selling, general and administrative costs in 2007 declined approximately 6% compared with 2006, reflecting lower sales volume and expense control efforts. Other manufacturing Berkshire’s other manufacturing businesses include a wide array of businesses. Included in this group are several manufacturers of building products (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville and MiTek) and apparel (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes the Russell athletic apparel and sporting goods business and the Vanity Fair Brands women’s intimate apparel business). Also included in this group are Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehicles, CTB International (“CTB”), a manufacturer of equipment for the livestock and agricultural industries and ISCAR Metalworking Companies (“IMC”), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide. There are also numerous other manufacturers of consumer and commercial products in this diverse group. Revenues of other manufacturing businesses in 2008 of $14,127 million declined $332 million (2%) versus 2007. The most significant declines were from Forest River, the building products businesses and the apparel businesses. These were somewhat offset by increased revenues from IMC and from Richline, a jewelry manufacturer acquired during the second half of 2007. Pre-tax earnings of other manufacturing businesses of $1,675 million in 2008, declined $362 million (18%) versus 2007. Pre-tax earnings declined or were flat in nearly all of Berkshire’s other manufacturing operations with the exception of IMC. Pre-tax earnings from Forest River declined 56%, due to lower sales volume. Pre-tax earnings from apparel declined 34%, primarily due to lower sales volume and costs incurred to consolidate certain operations of Russell and Vanity Fair Brands. Pre-tax earnings from building products declined 28%, as a result of lower sales volumes and decreased manufacturing efficiencies as a consequence of the housing and credit crises. Revenues in 2007 from other manufacturing activities were $14,459 million, an increase of $2,471 million (21%) over 2006. The comparative increase was primarily attributable to the businesses acquired since mid-2006 as well as a significant increase from CTB. Revenues from the building products businesses declined $292 million in 2007 as demand was negatively affected by the slowdown in housing construction activity. Pre-tax earnings were $2,037 million in 2007, an increase of $281 million (16%) over 2006. The increases were primarily due to full-year inclusion in 2007 of IMC and increased earnings of CTB, partially offset by a 22% decline in earnings of the building products businesses. Other service Berkshire’s other service businesses include NetJets, the world’s leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft, and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft. Among the other businesses included in this group are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor (acquired March 2007); Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings; The Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools; International Dairy Queen, a licensor and service provider to about 5,700 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; The Buffalo News, a publisher of a daily and Sunday newspaper; and businesses that provide management and other services to insurance companies. 39 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Other service (Continued) In 2008, revenues of the group were $8,435 million, an increase of $643 million (8%) over 2007. The inclusion of twelve months of revenues from TTI in 2008 versus nine months in 2007 accounted for over 80% of the revenue increase. Excluding the impact of TTI, other service revenues in 2008 increased 2% over 2007. Pre-tax earnings of $971 million in 2008, were relatively unchanged from 2007. The impact from the TTI acquisition and increased earnings of FlightSafety was offset by lower earnings from NetJets and Pampered Chef. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NetJets, and to a lesser degree Pampered Chef, experienced a significant reduction in revenue as general economic conditions worsened. This resulted in lower customer usage and demand which negatively affected operating margins. In addition, NetJets incurred charges of $54 million to writedown the aircraft fleet. Revenues from the other service businesses in 2007 increased $1,981 million (34%) and pre-tax earnings increased $310 million (47%) as compared to 2006. The increase in revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2007 versus 2006 was attributable to the impact of business acquisitions (primarily TTI and Business Wire) as well as increased revenues and pre-tax earnings from FlightSafety and NetJets. Both of these businesses benefited in 2007 from higher equipment (simulators and aircraft) utilization rates and from increased customer demand. Retailing Berkshire’s retailing operations consist of four home furnishings (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s) and three jewelry (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge) retailers. See’s Candies is also included in this group. Retailing revenues were $3,104 million in 2008, a decrease of $293 million (9%) versus 2007. Pre-tax earnings of $163 million in 2008 declined $111 million (41%) compared to 2007. Seven of the eight retail operations experienced revenue declines and all eight of these operations had declines in earnings compared to 2007. During the first nine months of 2008, as the impact of the economic recession in the U.S. worsened, consumer spending declined. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the decline accelerated and conditions for most retailers throughout the U.S. deteriorated. Fourth quarter of 2008 revenues and pre-tax earnings of Berkshire’s retailers declined 17% and 33%, respectively, versus the fourth quarter of 2007. Finance and Financial Products A summary of revenues and earnings from Berkshire’s finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Manufactured housing and finance $ 3,560 $ 3,665 $ 3,570 $ 206 $ 526 $ 513 Furniture/transportation equipment leasing 773 810 880 87 111 182 Other 614 644 674 494 369 462 $ 4,947 $ 5,119 $ 5,124 Pre-tax earnings 787 1,006 1,157 Income taxes and minority interests 308 374 425 $ 479 $ 632 $ 732 Revenues from manufactured housing and finance activities (Clayton Homes) in 2008 decreased $105 million (3%) from 2007. The decrease included a 9% decline from home sales, reflecting declines in units sold and average selling prices. In addition, revenues in 2007 included approximately $90 million from the housing communities division which was sold in the first quarter of 2008. Partially offsetting these declines was an increase in interest income from installment loans. The increase in interest income reflects higher average installment loan balances in 2008 versus 2007. Installment loan balances were approximately $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $1.5 billion since December 31, 2007. The increase was principally due to loan portfolio acquisitions. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes in 2008 declined $320 million (61%) from 2007. Pre-tax earnings in 2008 included a $125 million increase in the provision for estimated loan losses due to changes in loan collection and recovery assumptions, 40 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Finance and Financial Products (Continued) $25 million of losses arising from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and $38 million from asset writedowns and plant closure costs. Pre-tax earnings in 2008 also reflected the impact of lower home sales and higher interest expense from increased borrowings and an increase in interest rates. Partially offsetting these declines was a $22 million gain from the sale of the housing community division in the first quarter of 2008. Revenues and pre-tax earnings from furniture and transportation equipment leasing activities in 2008 declined $37 million (5%) and $24 million (22%), respectively, compared to 2007. The declines primarily reflected lower rental income driven by relatively low utilization rates for over-the-road trailer and storage units, partially offset by the impact of a small furniture rental business acquisition in 2008. Significant cost components of this business are fixed (depreciation and facility expenses), so earnings declined disproportionately to revenues. Revenues and pre-tax earnings for 2007 decreased $70 million (8%) and $71 million (39%), respectively, as compared to 2006, primarily for the reasons previously stated. Earnings from other finance business activities consisted primarily of interest income earned on fixed maturity investments and from a small portfolio of commercial real estate loans. Pre-tax earnings in 2007 reflected a charge of approximately $67 million from the adverse effects of changes in mortality assumptions on certain life annuity contract liabilities. In 2006, pre-tax earnings included income of $67 million from an equity purchase commitment fee. Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses follows. Amounts are in millions. 2008 2007 2006 Investment gains/losses from - Sales and other disposals of investments - Insurance and other $ 912 $ 5,308 $ 1,782 Finance and financial products 6 187 6 Other-than-temporary impairments (1,813 ) — (142 ) Other 255 103 165 (640 ) 5,598 1,811 Derivative gains/losses from - Credit default contracts (1,774 ) 127 525 Equity index put option contracts (5,028 ) (283 ) 64 Other derivative contracts (19 ) 67 235 (6,821 ) (89 ) 824 Gains/losses before income taxes and minority interests (7,461 ) 5,509 2,635 Income taxes and minority interests (2,816 ) 1,930 926 Net gains/losses $ (4,645 ) $ 3,579 $ 1,709 Investment gains or losses are recognized upon the sales of investments, recognition of non-cash other-than-temporary-impairment losses or as otherwise required under GAAP. The timing of realized gains or losses from sales can have a material effect on periodic earnings. However, such gains or losses usually have little, if any, impact on total shareholders’ equity because most equity and fixed maturity investments are carried at fair value with any unrealized gain or loss included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The other-than-temporary-impairment losses recorded in 2008 were primarily attributable to investments in certain equity securities. Berkshire considers several factors in determining impairment losses including the current and expected long-term business prospects of the issuer, the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline and its ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers. Derivative gains/losses in 2008 primarily represented the non-cash changes in fair value of credit default and equity index put option contracts. Changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of equity and credit markets. Management does not view the periodic gains or losses from the changes in fair value as meaningful given the long-term nature of these contracts and the volatile nature of equity and credit markets over short periods of time. Therefore, the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses may not be known for years. 41 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) Losses from credit default contracts in 2008 derived primarily from valuation increases due to significant widening of credit default spreads during the fourth quarter of 2008 with respect to the non-investment grade issuers included in the high yield index contracts and the credit default spreads of certain states and municipalities. The estimated fair value of credit default contracts at December 31, 2008 was $4.1 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from December 31, 2007. The year-to-date increase included fair value pre-tax losses of $1.8 billion and premiums from contracts entered into in 2008 of $633 million, partially offset by loss payments of $152 million. In January 2009, there were defaults by six companies included in the high yield indexes. Estimated payments in the first quarter of 2009 related to these defaults are expected to be approximately $750 million. The estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts at December 31, 2008 was $10.0 billion, an increase of approximately $5.4 billion from December 31, 2007 and an increase of $3.3 billion from September 30, 2008. The year-to-date increase included pre-tax losses of $5.0 billion due to changes in fair values and premiums from new contracts. There have been no loss payments under equity index put option contracts. Berkshire’s losses from equity index put option contracts in 2008 reflected index value declines of between 30% and 45% in 2008 across the four indexes. During the fourth quarter of 2008 these indexes declined between 10% and 22%. These contracts expire beginning in 2019 with the last expiration in 2028. Any loss payments under these contracts will be based on the net decline in the underlying index below the strike price in each contract as of the expiration date of the contract. Financial Condition Berkshire’s balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity. Consolidated cash and invested assets, excluding assets of utilities and energy and finance and financial products businesses, was approximately $122.0 billion at December 31, 2008 (including cash and cash equivalents of $24.3 billion) and $141.2 billion at December 31, 2007 (including cash and cash equivalents of $37.7 billion). Berkshire’s invested assets are held predominantly in its insurance businesses. The decline in cash and invested assets is primarily due to a significant reduction in the carrying amount of equity securities resulting from the worldwide economic crisis. Berkshire acquired a 60% interest in Marmon Holdings, Inc. (“Marmon”) for $4.5 billion on March 18, 2008. In the second quarter of 2008, Berkshire acquired additional shares and currently owns 63.6% of Marmon. Berkshire has agreed to acquire the remaining minority shareholders’ interests in Marmon between 2011 and 2014 for consideration based on Marmon’s future earnings. During the fourth quarter of 2008, Berkshire invested $6.5 billion in subordinated notes and preferred stock of the Wm. Wrigley, Jr. Company in connection with Mars, Incorporated’s acquisition of that entity. In addition, Berkshire invested $5 billion in Goldman Sachs perpetual preferred stock and common stock warrants and $3 billion in General Electric Company perpetual preferred stock and common stock warrants. These investments were funded with available cash. Notes payable and other borrowings of the insurance and other businesses were $4.3 billion (includes about $2.3 billion issued or guaranteed by Berkshire Hathaway Inc.) at December 31, 2008, an increase of $1.7 billion from December 31, 2007, primarily due to increases in short-term borrowings (principally NetJets) and debt of businesses acquired in 2008, (principally Marmon). MidAmerican’s capital expenditures were $3.9 billion in 2008 and are forecasted to be approximately $3.3 billion in 2009. MidAmerican expects to fund these capital expenditures with cash flows from operations and debt proceeds. Certain of its borrowings are secured by certain assets of its regulated utility subsidiaries. Notes payable and other borrowings of MidAmerican maturing in 2009 are $1.26 billion with an additional $1.26 billion due before the end of 2011. Berkshire has committed until February 28, 2011 to provide up to $3.5 billion of additional capital to MidAmerican to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund MidAmerican’s regulated utility subsidiaries. Berkshire has not and does not intend to guarantee the repayment of debt by MidAmerican or any of its subsidiaries. Assets of the finance and financial products businesses as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, fixed maturity securities and cash and cash equivalents. Liabilities were $30.7 billion as of December 31, 2008 and $22.0 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase from 2007 primarily relates to an increase of $7.7 billion in derivative contract liabilities (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the preceding section of Management’s 42 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) Discussion for additional information). As of December 31, 2008, notes payable and other borrowings of $13.4 billion included $10.8 billion of medium-term notes issued by BHFC. During 2008, BHFC issued debt of $5.0 billion and repaid $3.1 billion of notes. BHFC notes are guaranteed by Berkshire and mature at various dates extending through 2018. The proceeds from these notes were used to finance originated and acquired loans of Clayton Homes. During 2008, credit markets became increasingly restricted as a consequence of the ongoing worldwide credit crisis. As a result, the availability of credit to corporations has declined significantly and interest rates for new issues increased relative to government obligations, even for companies with strong credit histories and ratings. Although management believes that the credit crisis is temporary and that Berkshire has ample liquidity and capital to withstand these conditions, restricted access to credit markets over longer periods could have a significant negative impact on operations, particularly the utilities and energy business and certain finance and financial products operations. Management believes that it currently maintains ample liquidity to cover its contractual obligations and provide for contingent liquidity needs. During 2008, Berkshire’s consolidated shareholders’ equity declined from $120.7 billion at the end of 2007 to $109.3 billion at December 31, 2008. This reduction was largely due to significant price declines in Berkshire’s equity investments and an increase in the fair value of the liabilities arising from Berkshire’s equity index put option contracts. The worldwide economic crisis has continued during the first part of 2009 and prices of Berkshire’s equity investments have declined further and the fair values of liabilities arising from equity index put option contracts have increased further. Berkshire estimates that its consolidated shareholders’ equity has been reduced by approximately $8 billion since the end of 2008. Contractual Obligations Berkshire and its subsidiaries have contractual obligations which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Contractual obligations arise under financing and other agreements, which are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and other long-term contracts to acquire goods or services in the future, which are not currently reflected in the financial statements. Such obligations, including future minimum rentals under operating leases, will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date. Contractual obligations for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are estimates. The timing and amount of such payments are contingent upon the outcome of claim settlement activities that will occur over many years. The amounts presented in the following table have been estimated based upon past claim settlement activities and therefore are subject to significant estimation error. The factors affecting the ultimate amount of claims are discussed in the following section regarding Berkshire’s critical accounting policies. In addition, certain losses and loss adjustment expenses for property and casualty loss reserves are ceded to others under reinsurance contracts and therefore are recoverable. Such recoverables are not reflected in the table. A summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 follows. Amounts are in millions. Estimated payments due by period Total 2009 2010-2011 2012-2013 After 2013 Notes payable and other borrowings (1) $ 59,865 $ 5,733 $ 8,590 $ 10,131 $ 35,411 Operating leases 3,115 583 889 587 1,056 Purchase obligations (2) 25,282 6,552 6,885 4,673 7,172 Unpaid losses and loss expenses (3) 59,236 12,831 14,317 8,179 23,909 Other 32,512 4,473 3,196 2,700 22,143 Total $ 180,010 $ 30,172 $ 33,877 $ 26,270 $ 89,691 (1) Includes interest. (2) Principally relates to future aircraft, coal, electricity and natural gas purchases. (3) Before reserve discounts of $2,616 million. 43 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized in the financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on numerous assumptions involving varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, the amounts currently reflected in the financial statements will likely increase or decrease in the future as additional information becomes available. Property and casualty losses A summary of Berkshire’s consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Except for certain workers’ compensation reserves, liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as “gross unpaid losses”) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value, regardless of the length of the claim-tail. Amounts are in millions. Gross unpaid losses Net unpaid losses * Dec. 31, 2008 Dec. 31, 2007 Dec. 31, 2008 Dec. 31, 2007 GEICO $ 7,336 $ 6,642 $ 7,012 $ 6,341 General Re 18,241 19,831 17,235 17,651 BHRG 26,179 24,894 21,386 20,223 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 4,864 4,635 4,470 4,127 Total $ 56,620 $ 56,002 $ 50,103 $ 48,342 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges reinsurance assumed and before foreign currency translation effects. Berkshire records liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts with respect to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of loss payments is subject to a great degree of variability and is contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the determination of the ultimate amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used in establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses. Regardless of the techniques used, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amounts payable in the future. As a result, uncertainties are imbedded in and permeate the actuarial loss reserving techniques and processes used. As of any balance sheet date, not all claims that have occurred have been reported and not all reported claims have been settled. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include provisions for reported claims (referred to as “case reserves”) and for claims that have not been reported (referred to as incurred but not yet reported (“IBNR”) reserves). The time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement payment date is referred to as the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within a few years of occurrence. Casualty losses usually have very long claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations. The legal environment further contributes to extending claim-tails. Receivables are recorded with respect to losses ceded to other reinsurers and are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses. In addition to the factors cited above, reinsurance recoverables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders. Berkshire’s insurance businesses utilize loss reserving techniques that are believed to best fit the particular business. Additional information regarding reserving processes of the significant businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows. GEICO GEICO’s gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves as of December 31, 2008 were $7,336 million. As of December 31, 2008, gross reserves included $5,265 million of reported average, case and case development reserves and $2,071 million of IBNR reserves. 44 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance which has a relatively short claim-tail. The key assumptions affecting GEICO’s reserves include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”), which includes loss adjustment expenses. GEICO’s reserving methodologies produce reserve estimates based upon the individual claims (or a “ground-up” approach), which yields an aggregate estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Ranges of loss estimates are not determined in the aggregate. Actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserves using recognized standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The significant reserve components (and percentage of gross reserves) are: (1) average reserves (20%), (2) case and case development reserves (55%) and (3) IBNR reserves (25%). Each component of loss reserves is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. Such amounts are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, rated state, reporting date and occurrence date, among other factors. A brief discussion of each reserve component follows. Average reserve amounts are established for reported auto damage claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. The average reserves are established as a reasonable estimate for incurred claims for which claims adjusters have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that are paid within a relatively short time after being reported. Average reserve amounts are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened. Claims adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as soon as the specific facts and merits of each claim can be evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised as more information becomes known. For most liability coverages, case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim-tail, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is established. Therefore, additional case development reserve estimates are established, usually as a percentage of the case reserve. As of December 31, 2008, case development reserves averaged approximately 20% of total established case reserves. In general, case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves. Case development factors are reviewed and revised periodically. For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are subtracted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established through the collaborative effort of actuarial, claims and other management. For each of its major coverages, GEICO tests the adequacy of the total loss reserves using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Loss reserve estimates recorded at the end of 2007 developed downward by approximately $205 million when reevaluated at December 31, 2008 producing a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2008. These downward reserve developments represented approximately 2% of earned premiums in 2008 and approximately 3% of the prior year-end reserve amount. Reserving assumptions at December 31, 2008 were modified appropriately to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future reserve development will depend on whether frequency and severity turn out to be more or less than anticipated. Within the automobile line of business the reserves with the most uncertainty are for liability coverages, due to the longer claim-tails. Approximately 90% of GEICO’s reserves as of December 31, 2008 were for automobile liability, of which bodily 45 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) injury (“BI”) coverage accounted for approximately 55%. Management believes it is reasonably possible that the average BI severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used. If actual BI severity changes one percentage point from what was used in establishing the reserves, the reserves would develop up or down by approximately $112 million resulting in a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to be different from expected would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. GEICO’s exposure to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining reserves associated with such exposure are currently a relatively insignificant component of GEICO’s total reserves (approximately 2%) and there is minimal apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure. Related claim activity over the past year was insignificant. General Re and BHRG General Re’s and BHRG’s property and casualty loss reserves derive primarily from assumed reinsurance. There are additional uncertainties unique to loss reserving processes for reinsurance. The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which are affected by market conditions and practices) and other factors. Due to the lack of standardization of contract terms and conditions, the wide variability of coverage needs of individual clients and the tendency for those needs to change rapidly in response to market conditions, the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainties, in and of themselves, cannot be reliably measured. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative, per occurrence excess contracts or retroactive contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract. This occurs when company personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. Loss information from aggregate excess-of-loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Occasionally loss information is reported in summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is provided through periodic reports and may include the amount of ceded losses paid where reimbursement is sought as well as case loss reserve estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers. Each of Berkshire’s reinsurance businesses has established practices to identify and gather needed information from clients. These practices include, for example, comparison of expected premiums to reported premiums to help identify delinquent client periodic reports and claim reviews to facilitate loss reporting and identify inaccurate or incomplete claim reporting. These practices are periodically evaluated and changed as conditions, risk factors and unanticipated areas of exposures are identified. The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is delayed in comparison with primary insurance. In some instances there are multiple reinsurers assuming and ceding parts of an underlying risk causing multiple contractual intermediaries between General Re or BHRG and the primary insured. In these instances, the delays in reporting can be compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer varies depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms and other factors. Contracts covering casualty losses on a per occurrence excess basis may experience longer delays in reporting due to the length of the claim-tail as regards to the underlying claim. In addition, ceding companies may not report claims to the reinsurer until they believe it is reasonably possible that the reinsurer will be affected, usually determined as a function of its estimate of the claim amount as a percentage of the reinsurance contract retention. However, the timing of reporting large per occurrence excess property losses or property catastrophe losses may not vary significantly from primary insurance. Under contracts where periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies, such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals which in the U.S. range from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. In continental Europe, reinsurance reporting practices vary. Fewer clients report premiums, losses and case reserves on a quarterly basis. In certain countries, clients report annually, generally 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. The extended reporting lag does not result in a significant increase in risk or uncertainty as the actuarial reserving methodologies are adjusted to compensate for the delays. 46 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re and BHRG (Continued) Premium and loss data is provided through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data provided is incomplete, inaccurate or outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Reinsurance contracts generally allow for Berkshire’s reinsurance subsidiaries to have access to the cedant’s books and records with respect to the subject business and provide them the ability to conduct audits to determine the accuracy and completeness of information. Audits are conducted when management deems it appropriate. In the normal course of business, disputes with clients arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under the reinsurance policies. Most coverage disputes are resolved by the company’s claims department personnel and the appropriate client personnel or by independent outside counsel. If disputes cannot be resolved, contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or alternative dispute resolution will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on Berkshire’s results of operations or financial condition. In summary, the scope, number and potential variability of assumptions required in estimating ultimate losses from reinsurance contracts of General Re and BHRG are more uncertain than primary property and casualty insurers due to the factors previously discussed. General Re General Re’s gross and net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and gross reserves by major line of business as of December 31, 2008 are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Type Line of business Reported case reserves $ 9,959 Workers’ compensation (1) $ 3,108 IBNR reserves 8,282 Professional liability (2) 1,450 Gross reserves 18,241 Mass tort–asbestos/environmental 1,810 Ceded reserves and deferred charges (1,006 ) Auto liability 2,871 Net reserves $ 17,235 Other casualty (3) 3,399 Other general liability 2,908 Property 2,695 Total $ 18,241 (1) Net of discounts of $2,616 million. (2) Includes directors and officers and errors and omissions coverage. (3) Includes medical malpractice and umbrella coverage. General Re’s process of establishing loss reserve estimates is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (“ACRs”) and IBNR reserves. Critical judgments in establishing loss reserves involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the expectation of ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and the case reserve reporting trends compared to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded reserve amounts are subject to “tail risk” where reported losses develop beyond the maximum expected loss emergence pattern time period. General Re does not routinely determine loss reserve ranges because it believes that the techniques necessary have not sufficiently developed and the myriad of assumptions required render such resulting ranges to be unreliable. In addition, counts of claims or average amounts per claim are not utilized because clients do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail. Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners’ estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners’ estimates are significantly greater than the ceding company’s estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACRs are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2008, ACRs aggregated $3.1 billion before discounts and were concentrated in workers’ compensation reserves, and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. Examiners also periodically conduct detailed claim reviews of individual clients and case reserves are often increased as a result. In 2008, claim examiners conducted about 340 claim reviews. 47 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) Actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (“reserve cells”) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative and program) and line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, etc.). For each reserve cell, premiums and losses are aggregated by accident year, policy year or underwriting year (depending on client reporting practices) and analyzed over time. These loss aggregations are internally called loss triangles which serve as the primary basis for IBNR reserve calculations. Over 300 reserve cells are reviewed for North American business and approximately 900 reserve cells are reviewed with respect to international business. Loss triangles are used to determine the expected case loss emergence patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, are further used to determine IBNR reserves. Additional calculations form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern. The determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly a mechanical process. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, estimation formulas are used along with reliance on other loss triangles and judgment. Factors affecting loss development triangles include but are not limited to the following: changes in client claims practices, changes in claim examiners’ use of ACRs or the frequency of client company claim reviews, changes in policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. These factors influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns. Expected loss ratios are selected by reserve cell, by accident year, based upon reviewing forecasted losses and indicated ultimate loss ratios that are predicted from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premium. If the selected emergence pattern is not accurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios will not be accurate and this can affect the selected loss ratios and hence the IBNR reserve. As with selected loss emergence patterns, selecting expected loss ratios is not a strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing loss ratios. IBNR reserves are estimated by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, actuaries calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year. This calculation does not involve new assumptions and uses the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year. In 2008, for prior years’ workers’ compensation losses, reported claims were less than expected claims by about $93 million. However, further analysis of the workers’ compensation reserve cells by segment indicated the need for additional IBNR. These developments precipitated about $116 million of a net increase in nominal IBNR reserve estimates for unreported occurrences. After deducting $117 million for the change in net reserve discounts during the year, workers’ compensation losses from prior years reduced pre-tax earnings in 2008 by $140 million. To illustrate the sensitivity of changes in expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios for General Re’s significant excess-of-loss workers’ compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves of approximately $623 million and $339 million on a discounted basis as of December 31, 2008. The increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. Management believes it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates. Other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) were favorable in 2008 relative to expectations. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a year means that loss reserve amounts currently established will continue to develop favorably. For General Re’s significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells (including medical malpractice, umbrella, auto and general liability), an increase of five points in the tails of the expected emergence patterns and an increase of five percent in expected loss ratios (one percent for large international proportional reserve cells) would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $805 million. Management believes it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $805 million. 48 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) Property losses were lower than expected in 2008 but the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses. In response to favorable claim developments and another year of information, estimated remaining World Trade Center losses were reduced by $25 million. In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (“D&O and E&O”) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected emergence patterns. These cells often involve a spike in loss activity arising from recent industry developments making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern. For General Re’s large D&O and E&O reserve cells an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern (for those cells where emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $250 million. Management believes it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates. Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, “mass tort”) claims. Unpaid mass tort reserves at December 31, 2008 were approximately $1.8 billion gross and $1.2 billion net of reinsurance. Such reserves were approximately $1.8 billion gross and $1.2 billion net of reinsurance as of December 31, 2007. Mass tort net claims paid were about $69 million in 2008. In 2008, ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims were increased by $45 million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, General Re considers “survival ratios” based on net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. The three year survival ratio was approximately fourteen years as of December 31, 2008. The insurance industry’s comparable survival ratio for asbestos and pollution reserves was approximately nine years. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. BHRG BHRG’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2008 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions. Property Casualty Total Reported case reserves $ 1,836 $ 2,426 $ 4,262 IBNR reserves 1,821 3,466 5,287 Retroactive — 16,630 16,630 Gross reserves $ 3,657 $ 22,522 26,179 Deferred charges and ceded reserves (4,793 ) Net reserves $ 21,386 In general, the methodologies used to establish loss reserves vary widely and encompass many of the common methodologies employed in the actuarial field today. Certain traditional methodologies such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques are utilized as well as ground-up techniques where appropriate. Additional judgments must also be employed to consider changes in contract conditions and terms as well as the incidence of litigation or legal and regulatory change. As of December 31, 2008, BHRG’s gross loss reserves related to retroactive reinsurance policies were predominantly casualty losses. Retroactive policies include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses (relating to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date) above a contractual retention are indemnified or contracts that indemnify all losses paid by the counterparty after the policy effective date. Retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses paid in 2008 were $1.2 billion. The classification “reported case reserves” has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since the amount is often derived from reports in bulk from ceding companies, who may have inconsistent definitions of “case reserves.” Reserves are reviewed and established in the aggregate by contract including provisions for IBNR reserves. 49 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG (Continued) In establishing retroactive reinsurance reserves, historical aggregate loss payment patterns are often analyzed and projected into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. Management assigns judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. Management monitors claim payment activity and reviews ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, management reassesses expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process. During 2008, retroactive reserves developed upward by approximately $200 million. BHRG’s liabilities for environmental, asbestos, and latent injury losses and loss adjustment expenses are presently concentrated within retroactive reinsurance contracts. Reserves for such losses were approximately $9.2 billion at December 31, 2008 and $9.7 billion at December 31, 2007. Losses paid in 2008 attributable to these exposures were approximately $700 million. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not regularly receive reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies on a consistent basis, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data of the reinsured is conducted to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, estimates can only be developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. Potential legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on establishing loss reserves for mass tort claims in the future. The maximum losses payable by BHRG under retroactive policies are not expected to exceed approximately $24.3 billion as of December 31, 2008. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, management currently believes it unlikely that unpaid losses as of December 31, 2008 ($16.6 billion) will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15%. A significant number of recent reinsurance contracts are expected to have a low frequency of claim occurrence combined with a potential for high severity of claims. These include property losses from catastrophes, terrorism and aviation risks under catastrophe and individual risk contracts. Loss reserves related to catastrophe and individual risk contracts were approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2008, and were essentially unchanged from the prior year. In 2008 and 2007, loss reserves for prior years’ events declined by approximately $200 million which produced corresponding increases to pre-tax earnings each year. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Catastrophe loss reserves are provided when it is probable that an insured loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event. Other reinsurance reserve amounts are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on an individual contract basis, supplemented by management’s judgment of the impact on each contract of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon management’s judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding company’s loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared. Derivative contract liabilities Berkshire’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant amounts of derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. These contracts were primarily entered into in over-the-counter markets and certain elements in the terms and conditions of such contracts are not standardized. Furthermore, there is no source of independent data available to the Company that periodically shows trading volume and actual prices. As a result, the values of these liabilities are primarily based on valuation models, discounted cash flow models or other valuation techniques that are believed to be used by market participants. Such models or other valuation techniques may use inputs that are observable in the marketplace, while others are unobservable. 50 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Derivative contract liabilities (Continued) Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in pricing. Considerable judgment may be required in making assumptions, including the selection of interest rates, default and recovery rates and volatility. Changes in assumptions may have a significant effect on values. In determining the fair value of most of the credit default contracts, Berkshire used bid/ask pricing data on similar contracts as the basis for estimating fair value. Pricing data is monitored and reviewed by management for consistency as well as reasonableness. Pricing data for newer credit default contracts tends to vary little among the different pricing sources, which management believes is an indication that trading of such contracts is relatively active. As contracts age towards their expiration dates, the variations in pricing data can widen, which management believes is indicative of inactive markets. However, the impact of such variations is partially mitigated by shorter remaining durations and by the availability of data on newer contracts, which is used for comparison. Berkshire determines the estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts based on the widely used Black-Scholes option valuation model. Inputs to that model include the current index value, strike price, discount or interest rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted averaged discount and dividend rates used as of December 31, 2008 were each approximately 4%. Berkshire believes the most significant economic risks relate to changes in the index value component and to a lesser degree to the foreign currency component. For additional information, see Berkshire’s Market Risk Disclosures. The Black-Scholes model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. The weighted average volatility used as of December 31, 2008 was approximately 22%. The impact on fair value as of December 31, 2008 ($10.0 billion) from changes in volatility is summarized below. The values of contracts in an actual exchange are affected by market conditions and perceptions of the buyers and sellers. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model. Dollars are in millions. Hypothetical change in volatility (percentage points) Hypothetical fair value Increase 2 percentage points $ 10,451 Increase 4 percentage points 10,882 Decrease 2 percentage points 9,598 Decrease 4 percentage points 9,182 Other Critical Accounting Policies Berkshire records deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the difference between the consideration received and the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss expenses. Deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of loss payments. Adjustments to these assumptions are applied retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were $3.9 billion at December 31, 2008. Significant changes in the estimated amount and payment timing of unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization. Berkshire’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately $33.8 billion. A significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests. Such tests include periodically determining or reviewing the estimated fair value of Berkshire’s reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then individual assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is then charged to earnings as an impairment loss. 51 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Market Risk Disclosures Berkshire’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Berkshire’s significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. During the fourth quarter of 2008, conditions in the public debt and equity markets declined significantly resulting in exceptional volatility in debt and equity prices. The impact of actions taken recently by governmental bodies in response to the current economic crisis is difficult to predict, particularly over the short term. Berkshire management believes that these extraordinary conditions are temporary and that equity prices will ultimately rise over time and that credit markets will normalize but cannot predict the timing or magnitude of a recovery. The fair values of Berkshire’s investment portfolios and its equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility, particularly over the short term. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with Berkshire’s business activities. Interest Rate Risk Berkshire’s regularly invests in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Berkshire’s strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur with respect to assets. Berkshire strives to maintain high credit ratings so that the cost of debt is minimized. Berkshire utilizes derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks on a limited basis. The fair values of Berkshire’s fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate investments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate investments. The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that no other significant factors change that determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Strategically, Berkshire strives to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices and prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments may be concentrated in relatively few investees. At December 31, 2008, 57% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated in four investees. Berkshire prefers to hold equity investments for very long periods of time so management is not troubled by short-term equity price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. Berkshire strives to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short-term equity price volatility. Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. Berkshire is also subject to equity price risk with respect to its equity index put option contracts. While Berkshire’s ultimate potential loss with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between contract inception date and expiration, the change in fair value resulting from current changes in the index values are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract. These contracts generally expire 15 to 20 years from inception and may not be settled before their respective expiration dates. The following table summarizes Berkshire’s equity investments and derivative contract liabilities with equity price risk as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. The effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates is also shown. The selected 30% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in Berkshire’s equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

Financial statements of subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. Dollar as their functional currency are translated into U.S. Dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in earnings primarily as a result of the translation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities held by U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, Berkshire holds investments in major multinational companies that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own, such as the Coca-Cola Company. 53 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Foreign Currency Risk (Continued) Berkshire’s net assets subject to translation are primarily in the insurance and utilities and energy businesses, and to a lesser extent in the manufacturing and services businesses. The translation impact is somewhat offset by transaction gains or losses on net reinsurance liabilities denominated in foreign currencies of certain U.S. subsidiaries as well as the equity index put option liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries relating to contracts that would be settled in foreign currencies. Commodity Price Risk Berkshire, through its ownership of MidAmerican, is subject to commodity price risk. Exposures include variations in the price of wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold, fuel costs to generate electricity and natural gas supply for regulated retail gas customers. Electricity and natural gas prices are subject to wide price swings as demand responds to, among many other items, changing weather, limited storage, transmission and transportation constraints, and lack of alternative supplies from other areas. To mitigate a portion of the risk, MidAmerican uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other over-the-counter agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Accordingly, gains and losses associated with interim price movements on such contracts are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Financial results may be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. MidAmerican also uses futures, options and swap agreements to economically hedge gas and electric commodity prices for physical delivery to non-regulated customers. MidAmerican does not engage in a material amount of proprietary trading activities. The table that follows summarizes Berkshire’s commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of MidAmerican as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of that date.

Forward-looking statements include statements that are predictive in nature, that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, that include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects, and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions about Berkshire, economic and market factors and the industries in which Berkshire does business, among other things. These statements are not guaranties of future performance and Berkshire has no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal important risk factors that could cause Berkshire’s actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of Berkshire’s investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane or an act of terrorism that causes losses insured by Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries, changes in insurance laws or regulations, changes in Federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which Berkshire and its affiliates do business. 54 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on the following page.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings attributable to Berkshire for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Amounts are in millions. 2009 2008 2007 Insurance – underwriting $ 1,013 $ 1,805 $ 2,184 Insurance – investment income 4,085 3,497 3,510 Utilities and energy 1,071 1,704 1,114 Manufacturing, service and retailing 1,113 2,283 2,353 Finance and financial products 494 479 632 Other (207 ) (129 ) (159 ) Investment and derivative gains/losses 486 (4,645 ) 3,579 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire $ 8,055 $ 4,994 $ 13,213 Our operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team does participate in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. The declines in global economic activity over the last half of 2008 continued through 2009. Our operating results in 2009 were significantly impacted by those declines. Earnings in 2009 of most of our diverse group of manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined compared to the prior year. The effects from the economic recession resulted in lower sales volume, revenues and profit margins as consumers have significantly curtailed spending, particularly for discretionary items. Our two largest business segments, insurance and utilities, remain strong and operating results have not been negatively impacted in any significant way by the recession. In 2008 and the first part of 2009, equity and debt markets experienced major declines in market prices on a worldwide basis, which negatively impacted the fair value of our investments and derivative contracts. While market prices recovered somewhat over the remainder of 2009, the potential for significant declines in our investment values in the future remains. We had after-tax net investment and derivative gains of $486 million in 2009, while in 2008 we had losses of $4.6 billion. The gains and losses primarily derived from credit default contracts, dispositions of certain equity securities, other-than-temporary impairment charges with respect to certain equity securities and changes in estimated fair values of long duration equity index put option contracts. Changes in the equity and credit markets from period to period have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. In response to the crises in the financial markets and the global recession, the U.S. government and governments around the world are taking measures to stabilize financial institutions, regulate markets (including over-the-counter derivatives markets) and stimulate economic activity. While we believe that general economic conditions will improve over time, the ultimate impact of these actions on us is not clear at this time. Our operating companies have taken and will continue to take cost reduction actions as necessary to manage through the current economic situation. We continue to believe that the economic franchises of our operating businesses remain intact and that our operating results will ultimately improve, although we cannot predict the timing of an economic recovery that will be required for this to occur. Insurance—Underwriting We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Through General Re, we also reinsure life and health risks. 31 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing, with limited exceptions, is the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income. Our periodic underwriting results can be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. See the Critical Accounting Policies section of this discussion for information concerning the loss reserve estimation process. In addition, the timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results. In two out of the last three years, we benefited from relatively minor levels of catastrophe losses. In 2008, our underwriting results included estimated losses of approximately $900 million from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. In 2009 and 2008, our underwriting results also included significant unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the valuation of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities into U.S. Dollars as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations. A key marketing strategy followed by all of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $64 billion at December 31, 2009. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers. A summary follows of underwriting results from our insurance businesses for the past three years. Amounts are in millions. 2009 2008 2007 Underwriting gain attributable to: GEICO $ 649 $ 916 $ 1,113 General Re 477 342 555 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 349 1,324 1,427 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 84 210 279 Pre-tax underwriting gain 1,559 2,792 3,374 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 546 987 1,190 Net underwriting gain $ 1,013 $ 1,805 $ 2,184 GEICO Through GEICO, we primarily write private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO’s policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet, over the telephone or through the mail. This is a significant element in our strategy to be a low-cost auto insurer. In addition, we strive to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICO’s underwriting results for the past three years are summarized below. Dollars are in millions. 2009 2008 2007 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 13,758 $ 12,741 $ 11,931 Premiums earned $ 13,576 100.0 $ 12,479 100.0 $ 11,806 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 10,457 77.0 9,332 74.8 8,523 72.2 Underwriting expenses 2,470 18.2 2,231 17.9 2,170 18.4 Total losses and expenses 12,927 95.2 11,563 92.7 10,693 90.6 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 649 $ 916 $ 1,113 32 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Premiums earned in 2009 increased $1,097 million (8.8%) over premiums earned in 2008, reflecting growth in voluntary auto premiums earned as a result of an overall increase in policies-in-force of 7.8%. Policies-in-force grew more rapidly in the latter part of 2008 and the early part of 2009 and moderated over the remainder of 2009. As a result, premiums earned in 2009 increased at a higher rate than policies-in-force, despite a slight decline in premiums per policy. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2009 increased 9.0% versus 2008. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2009 were 684,000 greater than at December 31, 2008. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2009 increased $1,125 million (12.1%) compared with 2008. The loss ratio was 77.0% in 2009 compared to 74.8% in 2008. The higher loss ratio in 2009 reflected overall increases in average claim frequencies and injury claim severities. Claims frequencies in 2009 for physical damage coverages increased in the one to two percent range, while frequencies for injury coverages increased in the five to seven percent range compared with the very low frequency levels in 2008. Average injury severities in 2009 increased in the three to five percent range while average physical damage severities decreased in the two to four percent range from 2008. Incurred losses from catastrophe events in 2009 were $83 million, relatively unchanged from 2008. Underwriting expenses in 2009 increased $239 million (10.7%) due primarily to higher policy issuance costs and increased salary and employee benefit expenses, which included increased interest on deferred compensation liabilities. Premiums earned in 2008 increased 5.7% over 2007, reflecting an 8.2% increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force partially offset by lower average premiums per policy. Average premiums per policy declined during 2007 but leveled off in 2008. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2008 increased 9.5% over 2007. Incurred losses from catastrophe events for 2008 were $87 million compared to $34 million for 2007. Overall, the increase in the loss ratio reflected higher average claim severities and lower average premiums per policy, partially offset by lower average claims frequencies. Claims frequencies in 2008 for physical damage coverages decreased in the seven to nine percent range from 2007 and frequencies for injury coverages decreased in the four to six percent range. Physical damage severities in 2008 increased in the six to eight percent range and injury severities increased in the five to eight percent range over 2007. Underwriting expenses in 2008 increased $61 million (2.8%) over 2007. Policy acquisition expenses increased 8.5% in 2008 to $1,508 million, primarily due to increased advertising and policy issuance costs. The increase in policy acquisition expenses was partially offset by lower other underwriting expenses, including lower interest on deferred compensation liabilities. General Re General Re conducts a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. Property and casualty reinsurance is written in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Cologne Re (based in Germany) and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through Cologne Re. General Re strives to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines. Underwriting performance is not evaluated based upon market share and underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Re’s underwriting results are summarized for the past three years in the following table. Amounts are in millions. Premiums written Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Property/casualty $ 3,091 $ 3,383 $ 3,478 $ 3,203 $ 3,434 $ 3,614 $ 300 $ 163 $ 475 Life/health 2,630 2,588 2,479 2,626 2,580 2,462 177 179 80 $ 5,721 $ 5,971 $ 5,957 $ 5,829 $ 6,014 $ 6,076 $ 477 $ 342 $ 555 Property/casualty Premiums written in 2009 declined $292 million (8.6%) from 2008, which included $205 million with respect to a reinsurance-to-close transaction that increased our economic interest in the run-off of Lloyd’s Syndicate 435’s 2000 year of account from 39% to 100%. Under the reinsurance-to-close transaction, we also assumed a corresponding amount of net loss 33 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) General Re (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) reserves and as a result, there was no impact on net underwriting gains in 2008. There was no similar transaction in 2009. Excluding the reinsurance-to-close transaction and the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written in 2009 increased $149 million (4.7%) compared to 2008, primarily due to increased volume in North American, European treaty and Lloyd’s market property business. Premiums earned in 2009 declined $231 million (6.7%) from 2008. Excluding the effects of the reinsurance-to-close transaction in 2008 and the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums earned increased $107 million (3.3%) in 2009 as compared to 2008. The increase in premiums earned in 2009 was primarily due to increased volume in European treaty and Lloyd’s market property business. Increased price competition and capacity within the industry could lead to a decline in our premium volume in 2010. Underwriting results in 2009 included underwriting gains of $478 million from property business and losses of $178 million from casualty/workers’ compensation business. The property business produced underwriting gains of $173 million for the 2009 accident year, and $305 million from loss reserve reductions related to pre-2009 loss events. The property gains in 2009 were net of $48 million of losses from catastrophes, which were primarily from winter storm Klaus in Europe, the Victoria bushfires in Australia and an earthquake in Italy. The underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business were primarily the result of establishing higher loss reserves for 2009 accident year occurrences to reflect higher loss trends as well as $118 million of workers’ compensation loss reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, offset in part by reserve reductions related to prior years’ casualty and workers’ compensation loss reserves. Premiums written and earned in 2008 declined compared with 2007. Premiums in 2007 included $114 million from a reinsurance-to-close transaction which increased our economic interest in Lloyd’s Syndicate 435’s 2001 year of account to 100%. Otherwise, the declines in written and earned premiums in 2008 versus 2007 reflected underwriting discipline as the volume of business accepted declined where pricing was considered inadequate. Underwriting results in 2008 included $275 million in underwriting gains from property business partially offset by $112 million in underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business. The property business produced underwriting losses of $120 million for the 2008 accident year, offset by $395 million of gains from loss reserve reductions related to pre-2008 loss events. The 2008 accident year results included $174 million of catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and $56 million of catastrophe losses from European storms. The underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business in 2008 included $117 million of workers’ compensation loss reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, offset in part by reserve reductions related to prior years’ other casualty lines. The casualty results were adversely impacted by legal costs incurred in connection with regulatory investigations of finite reinsurance. Underwriting results in 2007 included $519 million in underwriting gains from property business partially offset by $44 million in underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business. The property business produced underwriting gains of $90 million for the 2007 accident year and $429 million from loss reserve reductions related to pre-2007 loss events. The pre-tax underwriting losses from casualty business in 2007 included $120 million of loss reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, as well as legal costs associated with finite reinsurance investigations. These charges were largely offset by underwriting gains in other casualty business. Life/health Life and health reinsurance premiums earned in 2009 increased 1.8% over 2008, which increased 4.8% over 2007. Excluding the effects of foreign currency, premiums earned increased 4.7% over 2008, which increased 2.2% over 2007. The increase in premiums earned in 2009 was primarily due to international business. The increase in premiums earned in 2008 was primarily from North American life business. Underwriting results for the global life/health operations produced underwriting gains of $177 million in 2009, $179 million in 2008 and $80 million in 2007. Life/health results were profitable in each of the past three years driven by gains from the life business due primarily to favorable mortality. 34 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group Through the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”), we underwrite excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages for insurers and reinsurers worldwide. Our business in BHRG includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and excess direct and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual discrete risks referred to as individual risk. Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Other multi-line refers to other business written on both a quota-share and excess basis, participations in and contracts with Lloyd’s syndicates as well as property, aviation and workers’ compensation programs. BHRG’s underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in millions. Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain/loss 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Catastrophe and individual risk $ 823 $ 955 $ 1,577 $ 782 $ 776 $ 1,477 Retroactive reinsurance 1,989 204 7,708 (448 ) (414 ) (375 ) Other multi-line 3,894 3,923 2,617 15 962 325 $ 6,706 $ 5,082 $ 11,902 $ 349 $ 1,324 $ 1,427 Catastrophe and individual risk contracts may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification, often several hundred million dollars and occasionally in excess of $1 billion, and cover catastrophe risks (such as hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters) or other property and liability risks (such as aviation and aerospace, commercial multi-peril or terrorism). The timing and magnitude of losses produce extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results of BHRG’s catastrophe and individual risk business. In early 2009, we constrained the volume of business written in response to the decline in our consolidated net worth that occurred in the first quarter. Though our net worth recovered significantly since then, we have continued to constrain the volume of business written in light of the BNSF acquisition. Also, premium rates were not attractive enough in 2009 to warrant increasing volume. Catastrophe and individual risk premiums written were approximately $725 million in 2009, $1.1 billion in 2008 and $1.2 billion in 2007. The decreases in premium volume were principally attributable to increased industry capacity for catastrophe reinsurance and, consequently, fewer opportunities to write business at prices we considered adequate. Based on soft market conditions prevailing at the end of 2009, we expect premium volume will continue to be constrained for at least the first half of 2010. The level of catastrophe and individual risk business we write in a given period will vary significantly based upon market conditions and our assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. Premiums earned from catastrophe and individual risk contracts in 2009 declined 14% from 2008, which decreased 39% from 2007. Underwriting results of our catastrophe and individual risk business in 2009 reflected no significant losses from catastrophes during the year, while in 2008 we incurred approximately $270 million of estimated losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Underwriting gains in 2008 included $224 million from a contract in which we agreed to purchase, under certain conditions, up to $4 billion of revenue bonds issued by the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund Finance Corporation. Our obligation was conditioned upon, among other things, the occurrence of a specified amount of Florida hurricane losses during a period that expired on December 31, 2008 and which was not met. Catastrophe and individual risk underwriting results in 2007 reflected no significant losses from catastrophe events occurring in that year. Premiums earned in 2009 from retroactive reinsurance included 2 billion Swiss Francs (“CHF”) (approximately $1.7 billion) from an adverse loss development contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. and its affiliates (“Swiss Re”) covering substantially all of Swiss Re’s non-life insurance losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses for loss events occurring prior to January 1, 2009. The Swiss Re contract provides aggregate limits of indemnification of 5 billion CHF in excess of a retention of Swiss Re’s reported loss reserves at December 31, 2008 (58.725 billion CHF) less 2 billion CHF. The impact on underwriting results from this contract was negligible as the premiums earned were offset by a corresponding amount of losses incurred. Premiums earned from retroactive reinsurance in 2007 included $7.1 billion from a reinsurance agreement with Equitas which became effective on March 30, 2007. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 35 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance include the recurring amortization of deferred charges that were initially established at the inception of these reinsurance contracts. At the inception of a contract, deferred charges represent the difference between the premium received and the estimated ultimate losses payable. Deferred charges are subsequently amortized over the estimated claims payment period using the interest method and are based on estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments. Amortization charges are recorded as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. Premiums earned in 2009 from other multi-line business of $3.89 billion were relatively unchanged from 2008. Premiums earned in 2009 and 2008 included $2.77 billion and $1.83 billion, respectively, from a 20% quota-share contract with Swiss Re covering substantially all of Swiss Re’s property/casualty risks incepting from January 1, 2008 and running through December 31, 2012. Excluding the Swiss Re quota-share contract, other multi-line business premiums earned in 2009 declined $969 million (46%) compared to 2008, primarily due to significant reductions in aviation, property, workers’ compensation and Lloyd’s market volume. Other multi-line premiums earned in 2008 increased $1.31 billion (50%) over 2007 reflecting premiums earned from the Swiss Re quota-share contract partially offset by lower premium volume from workers’ compensation programs. Pre-tax underwriting results from other multi-line reinsurance in 2009 included foreign currency transaction losses of about $280 million. The non-cash losses arose from the conversion of certain reinsurance loss reserves and other liabilities denominated in foreign currencies (primarily the U.K. Pound Sterling). The value of these currencies rose overall relative to the U.S. Dollar in 2009, resulting in losses. In 2008, underwriting results included foreign currency transaction gains of approximately $930 million, resulting from sharp declines in the Euro and U.K. Pound Sterling versus the U.S. Dollar. Excluding the effects of the currency gains/losses, other multi-line business produced a pre-tax underwriting gain of $295 million in 2009, $32 million in 2008 and $435 million in 2007. Pre-tax underwriting results in 2008 included approximately $435 million of estimated catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. There were no significant catastrophe losses in 2009 or 2007, which also benefited from relatively low property loss ratios and favorable loss experience on workers’ compensation business. In December 2007, we formed a monoline financial guarantee insurance company, Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corporation (“BHAC”). BHAC commenced operations during the first quarter of 2008 and is licensed in 49 states. In its first year of operation, BHAC produced $595 million of written premiums. In 2009, as a result of changing market conditions and demand, BHAC wrote about $40 million in premiums, most of which was in the first half of the year. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group Our primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses that principally write liability coverages for commercial accounts. These businesses include: Medical Protective Corporation (“MedPro”), a provider of professional liability insurance to physicians, dentists and other healthcare providers; National Indemnity Company’s primary group operation (“NICO Primary Group”), a writer of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as “Homestate” operations, providers of standard commercial multi-line insurance; Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers’ compensation solutions; and BoatU.S., a writer of insurance for owners of boats and small watercraft. Earned premiums by our primary insurance businesses were $1,773 million in 2009, $1,950 million in 2008 and $1,999 million in 2007. In 2009, with the exception of BoatU.S., each of our primary businesses generated lower premiums written and earned compared to 2008. Pre-tax underwriting gains as percentages of premiums earned were approximately 5% in 2009, 11% in 2008 and 14% in 2007. The declines in underwriting gains in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 resulted from higher loss ratios as increased price competition narrowed profit margins, and higher expense ratios, which reflected the impact of fixed costs on lower premium volume. 36 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income of our insurance operations follows. Amounts are in millions. 2009 2008 2007 Investment income before taxes, noncontrolling interests and equity method earnings $ 5,173 $ 4,722 $ 4,758 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,515 1,225 1,248 Net investment income before equity method earnings 3,658 3,497 3,510 Equity method earnings 427 — — Net investment income $ 4,085 $ 3,497 $ 3,510 Investment income consists of interest and dividends earned on cash equivalents and investments allocable to our insurance businesses. Pre-tax investment income in 2009 exceeded 2008 by $451 million. The increase in investment income in 2009 primarily reflected earnings from several large investments made in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first half of 2009, partially offset by lower earnings on cash and cash equivalents due to lower short-term interest rates and lower average cash balances. In October 2008, we acquired securities issued by Wrigley, Goldman Sachs and General Electric. In March 2009, we acquired a 12% convertible perpetual instrument of Swiss Re and in April 2009, we acquired an 8.5% Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock of Dow. In December 2009, we also acquired $1.0 billion par amount of new senior notes issued by Wrigley. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These investments were purchased at an aggregate cost of approximately $21.1 billion. At December 31, 2009, approximately 85% of these securities were held in our insurance group, with the remainder held primarily in our finance and financial products businesses. Our insurance group earned about $1.65 billion in interest and dividends from the aforementioned investments in 2009. Partially offsetting these increases were reductions in dividends earned from our investments in Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp common stock as a result of dividend rate cuts by those companies. Beginning in 2009, our insurance investment income also includes earnings from equity method investments (BNSF and Moody’s). Equity method earnings represent our proportionate share of the net earnings of these companies. As a result of a reduction of our ownership of Moody’s in July of 2009, we discontinued the use of the equity method for our investment in Moody’s as of the beginning of the third quarter. Dividends earned on equity method investments are not reflected in our earnings. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. 2009 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 18,655 $ 18,845 $ 28,257 Equity securities * 56,289 48,892 74,681 Fixed maturity securities 32,331 26,932 27,922 Other * 28,780 18,419 — $ 136,055 $ 113,088 $ 130,860 * Other investments include the investments in Wrigley, Goldman Sachs, General Electric, Swiss Re and Dow as well as the investment in BNSF, which as of December 31, 2008 is accounted for under the equity method. Berkshire’s investment in Moody’s was accounted for under the equity method at December 31, 2008 but included in equity securities at December 31, 2009. In 2007, investments in BNSF and Moody’s are included in equity securities. 37 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Fixed maturity investments as of December 31, 2009 were as follows. Amounts are in millions. Amortizedcost Unrealizedgains/losses Fairvalue U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies $ 2,356 $ 45 $ 2,401 States, municipalities and political subdivisions 3,689 274 3,963 Foreign governments 11,325 331 11,656 Corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, investment grade 4,375 469 4,844 Corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, non-investment grade 6,386 825 7,211 Mortgage-backed securities 2,185 71 2,256 $ 30,316 $ 2,015 $ 32,331 All U.S. government obligations are rated AAA by the major rating agencies and approximately 85% of all state, municipal and political subdivisions, foreign government obligations and mortgage-backed securities were rated AA or higher. Non-investment grade securities represent securities that are rated below BBB- or Baa3. Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $62 billion at December 31, 2009, $58 billion at December 31, 2008 and $59 billion at December 31, 2007. The cost of float, as represented by the ratio of underwriting gain or loss to average float, was negative for the last three years, as our insurance businesses generated underwriting gains in each year. Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) Revenues and earnings of MidAmerican for each of the past three years are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 MidAmerican Energy Company $ 3,711 $ 4,742 $ 4,325 $ 285 $ 425 $ 412 PacifiCorp 4,543 4,558 4,319 788 703 692 Natural gas pipelines 1,073 1,221 1,088 457 595 473 U.K. utilities 829 1,001 1,114 248 339 337 Real estate brokerage 1,071 1,147 1,511 43 (45 ) 42 Other 216 1,302 271 25 1,278 130 $ 11,443 $ 13,971 $ 12,628 Earnings before corporate interest and taxes 1,846 3,295 2,086 Interest, other than to Berkshire (318 ) (332 ) (312 ) Interest on Berkshire junior debt (58 ) (111 ) (108 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (313 ) (1,002 ) (477 ) Net earnings $ 1,157 $ 1,850 $ 1,189 Earnings attributable to Berkshire * $ 1,071 $ 1,704 $ 1,114 Debt owed to others at December 31 19,579 19,145 19,002 Debt owed to Berkshire at December 31 353 1,087 821 * Net of noncontrolling interests and includes interest earned by Berkshire (net of related income taxes). Through our 89.5% ownership interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (“MidAmerican”), we operate an international energy business. MidAmerican’s domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of two regulated utility companies and two interstate natural gas pipeline companies. In the United Kingdom, MidAmerican operates two electricity distribution businesses. The rates that our utilities and natural gas pipelines charge customers for energy and other services are 38 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) (Continued) generally subject to regulatory approval. Rates are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital. To the extent we are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, MidAmerican also operates a diversified portfolio of independent power projects and the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States. Our U.S. based regulated utilities businesses are conducted through MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and PacifiCorp. Revenues of MEC in 2009 declined $1,031 million (22%) from 2008, primarily due to lower regulated natural gas and electricity sales. Regulated natural gas revenues decreased by $520 million in 2009 primarily due to a lower average per-unit cost of gas sold, which is passed on to customers and a 5% decline in sales volume. MEC’s regulated electricity revenues declined $315 million primarily as a result of a 35% decline in average wholesale prices and lower volumes, which are attributable to reduced demand in the current economic environment as well as mild temperatures in 2009. MEC’s earnings before corporate interest and income taxes (“EBIT”) in 2009 declined $140 million (33%) compared to 2008, primarily due to the lower regulated electricity revenues and increased depreciation due to additions of new wind-power generation facilities, partially offset by lower costs of purchased electricity and natural gas. MEC’s revenues in 2008 increased $417 million (10%) over 2007. The increase reflects (1) increased regulated natural gas revenues from cost based price increases that are largely passed on to customers, (2) increased non-regulated gas revenues due primarily to higher prices and, to a lesser degree, increased volume and (3) increased wholesale regulated electricity revenues driven by volume increases. EBIT of MEC in 2008 increased $13 million (3%) versus 2007, resulting primarily from higher operating margins on wholesale regulated electricity and slightly higher margins from regulated gas sales, partially offset by increased interest expense and lower miscellaneous income. PacifiCorp’s revenues in 2009 of $4,543 million were relatively unchanged from 2008. Revenues in 2009 reflect an overall decrease in sales volume (both wholesale and retail) of approximately 2% and lower wholesale prices, somewhat offset by higher retail prices approved by regulators and higher renewable energy credit sales. PacifiCorp’s EBIT in 2009 of $788 million increased $85 million (12%) over 2008, primarily due to lower volume and prices of energy purchased in response to lower sales volumes and the use of lower-cost generation facilities put into service in the second half of 2008 and first quarter of 2009. PacifiCorp’s revenues in 2008 increased $239 million (6%) over 2007. The increase was primarily related to higher retail revenues due to regulator approved rate increases as well as increased customer growth and usage. PacifiCorp’s EBIT in 2008 increased $11 million (2%) versus 2007, as higher revenues were substantially offset by increased fuel costs and interest expense. Our natural gas pipeline businesses are conducted through Northern Natural Gas and Kern River. Natural gas pipelines revenues and EBIT in 2009 declined $148 million and $138 million, respectively, from 2008 due primarily to lower volumes due to the current economic climate, lower price spreads and the effects of a favorable rate proceeding included in the results for 2008. Natural gas pipelines revenues in 2008 increased $133 million (12%) over 2007. The increase reflected increased transportation revenue as a result of stronger market conditions at Northern Natural Gas, the impact of system expansion projects and changes related to Kern River’s current rate proceeding. EBIT in 2008 of the natural gas pipeline businesses increased $122 million (26%) over 2007, reflecting the impact of increased revenues. U.K. utility revenues in 2009 declined $172 million (17%) versus 2008, principally due to the impact from foreign currency exchange rates as a result of a stronger U.S. Dollar in 2009 as compared with 2008. EBIT of the U.K. utilities in 2009 declined $91 million (27%) compared to 2008. The decline in EBIT reflects foreign currency exchange rate changes as well as higher depreciation expense and charges to write down certain exploration and development assets. U.K. utility revenues in 2008 declined $113 million (10%) versus 2007 primarily from the effect of the significant strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the U.K. Pound Sterling over the second half of 2008. EBIT in 2008 was relatively unchanged from 2007 as the revenue decline was offset primarily by lower operating costs and interest expense. 39 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) (Continued) Real estate brokerage revenues declined $76 million (7%) as compared to 2008. The revenue decline was primarily due to lower home sales prices, as transaction volume was relatively unchanged from 2008. EBIT was $43 million in 2009 compared to a $45 million loss in 2008. The improvement in 2009 was principally due to lower commission and other operating expenses. Real estate brokerage revenues in 2008 declined $364 million (24%) compared to 2007 due to significant declines in transaction volume as well as lower average home sale prices. Real estate brokerage activities generated a loss before interest and taxes of $45 million in 2008 versus EBIT of $42 million in 2007. The loss in 2008 reflected the weak U.S. housing markets. EBIT from other activities in 2009 included $125 million in stock-based compensation expense recorded in the first quarter of 2009 as a result of the purchase of common stock issued by MidAmerican upon the exercise of the last remaining stock options that had been granted to certain members of management at the time of Berkshire’s acquisition of MidAmerican in 2000. Revenues and EBIT in 2008 from other activities included a gain of $917 million from MidAmerican’s investments in Constellation Energy and a fee of $175 million received as a result of the termination of the planned acquisition of Constellation Energy. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses for each of the past three years follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Marmon $ 5,067 $ 5,529 $ — $ 686 $ 733 $ — McLane Company 31,207 29,852 28,079 344 276 232 Shaw Industries 4,011 5,052 5,373 144 205 436 Other manufacturing 11,926 14,127 14,459 814 1,675 2,037 Other service * 6,585 8,435 7,792 (91 ) 971 968 Retailing 2,869 3,104 3,397 161 163 274 $ 61,665 $ 66,099 $ 59,100 Pre-tax earnings $ 2,058 $ 4,023 $ 3,947 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 945 1,740 1,594 $ 1,113 $ 2,283 $ 2,353 * We evaluate the results of NetJets using accounting standards for recognition of revenue and planned major maintenance expenses that were generally accepted when we acquired NetJets but are no longer acceptable due to subsequent changes adopted by the FASB. Revenues and pre-tax earnings for our other service businesses shown above reflect these prior revenue and expense recognition methods. Revenues shown above exceeded (were less than) the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements by $(942) million in 2009, $130 million in 2008 and $709 million in 2007. Pre-tax earnings in this table exceeded (were less than) the amounts included in our Consolidated Financial Statements by $(142) million in 2009, $(4) million in 2008 and $48 million in 2007. Marmon We acquired a 60% interest in Marmon Holdings, Inc. (“Marmon”) on March 18, 2008 and currently own a 64% interest. Marmon’s revenues, costs and expenses are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning as of the initial acquisition date. Revenues in 2009 declined approximately 27% from 2008 (including periods in 2008 prior to our acquisition). The revenue decline in 2009 reflected the impact of the recession which led to lower customer demand across all sectors, and particularly in the Building Wire, Engineered Wire and Cable, Flow Products and Distribution Services sectors. Pre-tax earnings in 2009 declined approximately 26% from the full year of 2008 which reflects the decline in revenues, somewhat offset by a $160 million reduction in operating costs resulting from cost reduction efforts. In 2009, the Retail Store Fixtures, Food Service Equipment and Water Treatment sectors produced comparable or improved earnings with 2008 despite lower revenues. The remaining sectors experienced lower earnings in 2009 compared to 2008. 40 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) McLane Company McLane Company, Inc., (“McLane”) is a wholesale distributor of grocery and non-food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. McLane’s business is marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins. Revenues were $31,207 million in 2009, an increase of $1,355 million (5%) compared to 2008. The increase in revenues in 2009 reflected an 8% increase in the grocery business, partially offset by an 11% decline from the foodservice business. The revenue increases in 2009 reflected additional grocery customers as well as manufacturer price increases and state excise tax increases. Approximately one-third of McLane’s annual revenues are from Wal-Mart. A curtailment of purchasing by Wal-Mart could have a material adverse impact on McLane’s earnings. Pre-tax earnings in 2009 increased $68 million (25%) over 2008. Earnings in 2009 included the impact of a substantial inventory price change gain associated with an increase in federal excise tax on cigarettes. Many tobacco manufacturers raised prices in anticipation of the tax increase, which allowed McLane to generate a one-time price change gain. The increase in earnings from the inventory price change gain was partially offset by a federally mandated one-time floor stock tax on related inventory held and by lower earnings from the foodservice business. The gross margin rate in 2009 was 5.72%. Cigarette excise tax inflation has a negative impact on margins by inflating gross sales while providing only marginal increases in profit since most markups are on a fixed amount per unit as opposed to a percentage of gross sales. Operating results in 2009 also benefited from lower fuel costs and operating expense control efforts. In 2008, revenues increased $1,773 million (6%) compared to 2007, reflecting increased customers and manufacturer price increases and state excise tax increases. Pre-tax earnings in 2008 increased $44 million (19%) over 2007. The increase in earnings in 2008 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and to a lesser degree a slight increase in gross margins. The gross margin rate was 5.91% in 2008 compared to 5.79% in 2007. The comparative increase in the gross margin rate reflected price changes related to certain categories of grocery products and the impact of a heavy liquids sales surcharge. Shaw Industries Shaw Industries (“Shaw”) is the world’s largest manufacturer of tufted broadloom carpets and is a full-service flooring company. Shaw’s sales volume and earnings during the last two years have been negatively impacted by the depressed residential housing market and the economic recession in the U.S. Revenues in 2009 were $4,011 million, a decline of $1,041 million (21%) from 2008. The revenue decrease in 2009 was primarily due to an 18% reduction in year-to-date carpet sales volume. In 2009, pre-tax earnings declined $61 million (30%) from 2008. Our operating results in 2009 benefitted from lower raw material costs. However, the favorable impact of the lower material costs was more than offset by relatively higher manufacturing costs attributable to significant declines in sales volume, which decreased plant operating levels and manufacturing efficiencies and resulted in lower selling and general expense coverage. During 2009, Shaw incurred costs of $101 million related to plant closures compared to $59 million in 2008. Revenues in 2008 declined $321 million (6%) compared to 2007, principally due to a reduction in year-to-date carpet sales volume, partially offset by higher average selling prices and revenues from business acquisitions. In 2008, pre-tax earnings declined $231 million (53%) to $205 million. The decline was attributable to both lower sales volume and higher product costs. Increases in petrochemical based raw material costs along with reduced manufacturing efficiencies caused the product cost increase. Pre-tax earnings in 2008 also included the aforementioned $59 million of charges related to plant closures. Other manufacturing Our other manufacturing businesses include a wide array of businesses. Included in this group are several manufacturers of building products (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville and MiTek) and apparel (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes the Russell athletic apparel and sporting goods business and the Vanity Fair Brands women’s intimate apparel business). Also included in this group are Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehicles, CTB International (“CTB”), a manufacturer of equipment for the livestock and agricultural industries and ISCAR Metalworking Companies (“IMC”), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide. 41 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Other manufacturing (Continued) Nearly all of the businesses in our manufacturing group experienced the adverse effects of the global economic recession in 2009 as consumers and customers cut purchases. Revenues in 2009 were $11,926 million, a decrease of $2,201 million (16%) from 2008. Revenues were lower for apparel (11%), building products (20%) and other businesses (16%) as compared to 2008. Pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses were $814 million in 2009, a decrease of $861 million (51%) versus 2008. The declines in earnings reflected the lower revenues as well as relatively higher costs resulting from lower manufacturing efficiencies. Revenues of $14,127 million in 2008 declined $332 million (2%) versus 2007. Pre-tax earnings were $1,675 million in 2008, a decline of $362 million (18%) versus 2007. Pre-tax earnings declined or were relatively unchanged in nearly all of our other manufacturing operations. All of our other manufacturing businesses have taken actions to reduce costs and reduce or delay capital spending until the economy improves. Other service Our other service businesses include NetJets, the world’s leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft, and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft. Among the other businesses included in this group are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor (acquired March 2007); Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings; The Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools; International Dairy Queen, a licensor and service provider to about 5,800 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; The Buffalo News, a publisher of a daily and Sunday newspaper; and businesses that provide management and other services to insurance companies. Revenues in 2009 were $6,585 million, a decrease of $1,850 million (22%) compared to 2008. Essentially all of our service businesses generated lower revenues in 2009, particularly at NetJets and to a lesser degree at TTI. In 2009, NetJets’ revenues declined $1,465 million (32%) versus 2008 due to a 77% decline in aircraft sales as well as lower flight operations revenues primarily due to a 19% decline in flight revenue hours. Revenues at TTI were 17% lower in 2009 than in 2008 which we attribute primarily to the economic recession. NetJets produced a pre-tax loss in 2009 of $711 million compared to pre-tax earnings of $213 million in 2008. The pre-tax loss at NetJets in 2009 included asset writedowns and other downsizing costs of $676 million compared to $54 million of such charges in 2008. NetJets owns more planes than is required for its present level of operations and plans to dispose of selected aircraft over time provided that prices are reasonable. We do not believe at this point that further downsizing will be required. We also believe, as a result of actions taken to date, that NetJets is likely to operate at a profit in 2010, assuming there is no further deterioration in the U.S. economy or negative actions directed at the ownership of private aircraft. Excluding the results of NetJets, our other service businesses produced pre-tax earnings of $620 million in 2009 compared to pre-tax earnings of $758 million in 2008. The negative impact of the global recession was evident on substantially all of our other service businesses. In 2008, revenues were $8,435 million, an increase of $643 million (8%) over 2007. The inclusion of twelve months of revenues from TTI in 2008 versus nine months in 2007 accounted for over 80% of the revenue increase. Excluding the impact of TTI, other service revenues in 2008 increased 2% over 2007. Pre-tax earnings in 2008 were $971 million, relatively unchanged from 2007. The impact from the TTI acquisition and increased earnings of FlightSafety were offset by lower earnings from NetJets and The Pampered Chef. Retailing Our retailing operations consist of four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge) and See’s Candies. Retailing revenues were $2,869 million in 2009, a decrease of $235 million (8%) compared to 2008. In 2009, our home furnishings revenues declined 7% while jewelry revenues declined 12% versus 2008. Pre-tax earnings in 2009 of $161 million were relatively unchanged from 2008. See’s Candies, Star Furniture and Nebraska Furniture Mart generated increased pre-tax earnings, while in the aggregate our jewelry businesses posted a pre-tax loss. Throughout 2008 as the impact of the economic recession in the U.S. worsened, consumer spending declined and these conditions continued in 2009. 42 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) Retailing revenues were $3,104 million in 2008, a decrease of $293 million (9%) versus 2007. Pre-tax earnings of $163 million in 2008 declined $111 million (41%) compared to 2007. Seven of the eight retail operations experienced revenue declines and all eight of these operations had declines in earnings compared to 2007. Finance and Financial Products A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Manufactured housing and finance $ 3,257 $ 3,560 $ 3,665 $ 187 $ 206 $ 526 Furniture/transportation equipment leasing 661 773 810 14 87 111 Other 669 614 644 580 494 369 $ 4,587 $ 4,947 $ 5,119 Pre-tax earnings 781 787 1,006 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 287 308 374 $ 494 $ 479 $ 632 Revenues in 2009 of our manufactured housing and finance business (Clayton Homes) declined $303 million (9%) from 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a 16% decline in units sold partially offset by higher average selling prices as a result of product mix changes and a slight increase in installment loan interest and other investment income. Revenues in 2008 declined $105 million (3%) from 2007, reflecting lower revenues from home sales and was partially offset by higher installment loan interest income. Also, revenues in 2007 included approximately $90 million from the housing communities division which was sold in the first quarter of 2008. Installment loan balances were approximately $12.3 billion as of December 31, 2009, a decline of about $300 million from December 31, 2008. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $187 million in 2009, a decline of $19 million (9%) from 2008. Pre-tax earnings in 2009 were negatively impacted by a $79 million increase in estimated loan loss provisions partially offset by improved margins from manufactured home sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses arising from cost reduction efforts. Pre-tax earnings in 2008 declined $320 million (61%) from 2007. Earnings in 2008 included a $125 million increase in estimated loan loss provisions, $25 million of losses arising from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and $38 million in losses from asset writedowns and plant closure costs. In both years overall operating results were negatively impacted by declines in home sales, increased borrowing costs and higher levels of borrowings. Revenues and pre-tax earnings from our furniture/transportation equipment leasing businesses in 2009 declined $112 million (14%) and $73 million (84%), respectively, compared to 2008. The declines primarily reflected lower rental income driven by relatively low utilization rates for over-the-road trailer and storage units, and lower furniture rentals. Significant cost components of this business are fixed (depreciation and facility expenses), so earnings declined disproportionately to revenues. Revenues and pre-tax earnings for 2008 decreased $37 million (5%) and $24 million (22%), respectively, as compared to 2007, primarily for the reasons previously stated. Revenues and earnings of Clayton Homes and the furniture/transportation equipment leasing businesses have been negatively affected by the economic recession as well as the credit crisis. Our manufactured housing loan programs are currently at a competitive disadvantage to the traditional single family mortgage market, which is currently receiving favorable interest rate subsidies from the U.S. government through government agency insured mortgages. Unlike site-built homes, very few factory-built homes qualify for these mortgages. This has produced a negative impact on manufactured housing construction and sales. However, even under these conditions, we believe Clayton Homes will continue to operate profitably. Earnings from our other finance business activities include investment income earned from a portfolio of fixed maturity and equity investments held by certain finance subsidiaries; interest earned from a small portfolio of long-held commercial real estate loans; net interest earned from an annuity insurance business, whose earnings primarily consist of the net interest accruing on interest bearing assets and liabilities; and earnings from an interest rate spread over the cost of Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation borrowing costs charged to and reflected in Clayton Homes’ earnings. 43 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Finance and Financial Products (Continued) Revenues and pre-tax earnings of other finance business activities in 2009 increased $55 million (9%) and $86 million (17%), respectively, due primarily to increased investment income earned from our acquisitions of higher yielding fixed maturity and equity investments, including portions of our acquisitions of Goldman Sachs and Wrigley securities. Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows. Amounts are in millions. 2009 2008 2007 Investment gains/losses from – Sales and other disposals of investments – Insurance and other $ 277 $ 912 $ 5,308 Finance and financial products 110 6 187 Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments (3,155 ) (1,813 ) — Other (69 ) 255 103 (2,837 ) (640 ) 5,598 Derivative gains/losses from – Credit default contracts 789 (1,774 ) 127 Equity index put option contracts 2,713 (5,028 ) (283 ) Other derivative contracts 122 (19 ) 67 3,624 (6,821 ) (89 ) Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 787 (7,461 ) 5,509 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 301 (2,816 ) 1,930 Net gains/losses $ 486 $ (4,645 ) $ 3,579 Investment gains or losses are recognized upon the sales of investments or as otherwise required under GAAP. The timing of realized gains or losses from sales can have a material effect on periodic earnings. However, such gains or losses usually have little, if any, impact on total shareholders’ equity because most equity and fixed maturity investments are carried at fair value with any unrealized gain or loss included as components of accumulated other comprehensive income. The recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment loss results in reductions in the cost basis of the investment, but not a reduction in fair value. Although we have recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses in earnings, we may continue to hold positions in most of these securities. The recognition of such losses does not necessarily indicate that sales are imminent or planned and sales ultimately may not occur. We use no bright line tests in determining whether impairments are temporary or other than temporary. We consider several factors in determining impairment losses including the current and expected long-term business prospects of the issuer, the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers. Other-than-temporary impairment losses in 2009 predominantly relate to a first quarter charge with respect to our investment in ConocoPhillips common stock. The market price of ConocoPhillips shares declined sharply over the last half of 2008. In 2009, we sold over half of the ConocoPhillips position we held at the end of 2008. Since a significant portion of the decline in the market value of our investment in ConocoPhillips occurred during the last half of 2008, a significant portion of the other-than-temporary impairment losses recorded in earnings in the first quarter of 2009 were recognized in other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2008. Other-than-temporary impairment losses recorded in 2008 (approximately $1.8 billion) were primarily related to investments in twelve equity securities. The unrealized losses in these securities generally ranged from 40% to 90% of cost. After reviewing these investments, we concluded that there was considerable uncertainty in the business prospects of these companies and thus greater uncertainty on the recoverability of the cost of the security. 44 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) With respect to equity securities with gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2009 and where other-than-temporary impairments were not recorded at December 31, 2009, approximately 90% of the losses were concentrated in four issuers. Unrealized losses were no greater than 30% of cost. In our judgment, the future earnings potential and underlying business economics of these companies are favorable and as of December 31, 2009, we possessed the ability and intent to hold these securities until their prices recover. Changing market conditions and other facts and circumstances may change the business prospects of these issuers as well as our ability and intent to hold these securities until the prices recover. Accordingly, we may record other-than-temporary impairment charges in future periods with respect to one or more of these securities. Derivative gains/losses primarily represent the changes in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contracts. Changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of equity and credit markets. We do not view the periodic gains or losses from the changes in fair value as meaningful given the volatile nature of equity and credit markets over short periods of time, particularly with respect to equity index put option contracts. The fair values of our credit default contracts are impacted by changes in credit default spreads, which have been volatile in recent periods. In the first quarter of 2009, we increased our estimates of credit default liabilities, which produced a pre-tax loss of approximately $1.35 billion. This loss resulted from several corporate defaults and the widening of credit default spreads, primarily with respect to the underlying non-investment grade issuers included in our high yield contracts. These non-investment grade issuers are typically highly leveraged and therefore dependent on having ongoing access to the capital markets. The freezing of the credit markets in late 2008 and early 2009 was particularly detrimental to these issuers. As a result, there were a number of defaults in 2009 and we made loss payments of approximately $1.9 billion. Over the last nine months of 2009, credit default spreads narrowed significantly and the estimated values of our liabilities declined resulting in pre-tax gains of approximately $2.14 billion. The losses from our credit default contracts in 2008 derived primarily from increases in the fair value of our liabilities due to a significant widening of credit default spreads during the fourth quarter of 2008. The estimated fair value of credit default contracts at December 31, 2008 was $4.1 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from December 31, 2007. The year-to-date increase included fair value pre-tax losses of $1.8 billion and premiums from contracts entered into in 2008 of $633 million, partially offset by loss payments of $152 million. In 2009, our gains on equity index put option contracts were $2.7 billion, compared to losses of $5.0 billion in 2008. The gains in 2009 reflected increases in the underlying equity indexes ranging from approximately 19% to 23%, partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar on non-U.S. contracts and lower interest rates. These factors combined to produce a decrease in our estimated liabilities. The losses in 2008 reflected declines of between 30% and 45% in underlying indexes. During the fourth quarter of 2008, these indexes declined between 10% and 22%. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates, which begin in 2018. As previously noted, we do not believe that the gains or losses reflected in earnings in the past two years to be meaningful relative to evaluating our ultimate payment obligations, if any. There have been no loss payments to date. Financial Condition Our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and financial strength. Our consolidated shareholders’ equity increased $21.8 billion during 2009 to $131.1 billion at December 31, 2009. Our consolidated cash and invested assets, excluding assets of utilities and energy and finance and financial products businesses, was approximately $146.0 billion at December 31, 2009 (including cash and cash equivalents of $27.9 billion) and $118.9 billion at December 31, 2008 (including cash and cash equivalents of $24.3 billion). Our invested assets are held predominantly in our insurance businesses. In 2009, we acquired a 12% convertible perpetual security issued by Swiss Re for $2.7 billion, an 8.5% Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock of Dow for $3 billion and senior notes of Wrigley due in 2013 and 2014 for $1.0 billion. Investment income generated by these investments will greatly exceed income currently earned on short-term investments. 45 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) Notes payable and other borrowings of our insurance and other businesses declined $630 million in 2009 to approximately $3.7 billion at December 31. The decline was primarily due to a combination of term debt maturities and a reduction in short-term borrowings. On February 12, 2010, we completed the acquisition of BNSF by acquiring the outstanding shares of BNSF that we did not already own for aggregate consideration of approximately $26.5 billion ($100 per BNSF share). The aggregate consideration consisted of a combination of $15.9 billion in cash and about 95,000 equivalent Class A shares of Berkshire common stock. In connection with the BNSF acquisition, we issued $8.0 billion aggregate par amount of senior notes consisting of $2.0 billion par amount of notes due in 2011; $1.7 billion par amount of notes due in 2012; $2.6 billion par amount of notes due in 2013; and $1.7 billion par amount of notes due in 2015. In connection with its railroad operations, BNSF regularly issues debt to finance capital expenditures and for other corporate purposes. We expect this practice to continue after our acquisition. As of December 31, 2009, BNSF had debt outstanding of about $10.3 billion. We do not intend to provide guarantees on BNSF debt outstanding at the acquisition date or issued in the future. Capital expenditures of our utilities and energy businesses in 2009 were approximately $3.4 billion and are currently forecasted to be approximately $2.6 billion in 2010. We expect MidAmerican and its operating subsidiaries to fund future capital expenditures with cash flows from operations and debt proceeds. MidAmerican’s borrowings were $19.6 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase of $434 million from December 31, 2008. MidAmerican and its operating subsidiaries currently have no significant debt maturities until 2011, when about $1.1 billion matures. We have committed until February 28, 2011 to provide up to $3.5 billion of additional capital to MidAmerican to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund its regulated utility subsidiaries. Berkshire does not intend to guarantee the repayment of debt by MidAmerican or any of its subsidiaries. Assets of the finance and financial products businesses, which consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, fixed maturity securities, other investments and cash and cash equivalents, were approximately $29.0 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $27.1 billion at December 31, 2008. Our finance and financial products liabilities were $26.4 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $30.7 billion at December 31, 2008. The decline in liabilities was primarily attributable to a decrease of $5.3 billion in derivative contract liabilities. As of December 31, 2009, notes payable and other borrowings of $14.6 billion included approximately $12.1 billion par amount of medium-term notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”), a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire. The BHFC notes that were outstanding at December 31, 2009, are unsecured and mature at various dates between 2010 and 2018. The proceeds from the medium-term notes were used to finance originated and acquired loans of Clayton Homes. The full and timely payment of principal and interest on the notes is guaranteed by Berkshire. In January 2010, BHFC repaid $1.5 billion of its maturing notes and issued new notes consisting of $250 million par amount due in 2012 and $750 million par amount due in 2040. During 2008 and continuing into the first part of 2009, access to credit markets became limited as a consequence of the worldwide credit crisis. As a result, interest rates for investment grade corporate issuers increased relative to government obligations, even for companies with strong credit histories and ratings. However, we believe that the credit crisis has abated and interest rates for investment grade issuers relative to government obligations have declined. Nevertheless, restricted access to credit markets at affordable rates in the future could have a significant negative impact on our operations, particularly the utilities and energy and the finance and financial products operations. We believe we currently maintain ample liquidity to cover our existing contractual obligations and provide for contingent liquidity needs. Contractual Obligations We regularly enter into contracts, which obligate us to make cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Contractual obligations arise under financing and other agreements, which are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements and other long-term contracts to acquire goods or services in the future, which are not currently reflected in our financial statements. Such obligations, including future minimum rentals under operating leases, will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date. The obligations of our insurance businesses to make payments of losses and loss adjustment expenses arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are estimates. The timing and amount of such payments are contingent upon the outcome of claim settlement activities that will occur over many years. The amounts presented in the following table were 46 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Contractual Obligations (Continued) estimated based upon past claim settlement activities and therefore are subject to significant estimation error. The factors affecting the ultimate amount of claims are discussed in the following section regarding our critical accounting policies. Although certain insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses are ceded to and recoverable from others under reinsurance contracts, such recoverables are not reflected in the table. A summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 follows. Amounts are in millions. Estimated payments due by period Total 2010 2011-2012 2013-2014 After 2014 Notes payable and other borrowings (1) $ 60,760 $ 6,394 $ 10,562 $ 8,360 $ 35,444 Operating leases 2,986 577 840 520 1,049 Purchase obligations 16,689 5,628 3,711 3,339 4,011 Unpaid losses and loss expenses (2) 61,889 13,423 14,546 8,072 25,848 Other 24,848 1,619 2,685 2,599 17,945 Total $ 167,172 $ 27,641 $ 32,344 $ 22,890 $ 84,297 (1) Includes interest. (2) Before reserve discounts of $2,473 million. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized in our financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on numerous assumptions involving varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, the amounts currently reflected in our financial statements will likely increase or decrease in the future as additional information becomes available. Property and casualty losses A summary of our consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Except for certain workers’ compensation reserves, liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as “gross unpaid losses”) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value, regardless of the length of the claim-tail. Amounts are in millions. Gross unpaid losses Net unpaid losses * Dec. 31, 2009 Dec. 31, 2008 Dec. 31, 2009 Dec. 31, 2008 GEICO $ 8,561 $ 7,336 $ 8,211 $ 7,012 General Re 17,594 18,241 16,170 17,235 BHRG 28,109 26,179 23,145 21,386 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 5,152 4,864 4,774 4,470 Total $ 59,416 $ 56,620 $ 52,300 $ 50,103 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges on reinsurance assumed and before foreign currency translation effects. We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts with respect to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of loss payments is subject to a great degree of variability and is contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the determination of the ultimate amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used in establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses. Regardless of the techniques used, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amounts payable in the future. As a result, uncertainties are imbedded in and permeate the actuarial loss reserving techniques and processes used. 47 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) As of any balance sheet date, not all claims that have occurred have been reported and not all reported claims have been settled. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include provisions for reported claims (referred to as “case reserves”) and for claims that have not been reported (referred to as incurred but not yet reported (“IBNR”) reserves). The time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement payment date is referred to as the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within a few years of occurrence. Casualty losses usually have very long claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations. The legal environment further contributes to extending claim-tails. Receivables are recorded with respect to losses ceded to other reinsurers and are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses. In addition to the factors cited above, reinsurance recoverables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders. We utilize loss reserving techniques that are believed to best fit the particular business. Additional information regarding reserving processes of our significant insurance businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows. GEICO GEICO’s gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves as of December 31, 2009 were $8,561 million. As of December 31, 2009, gross reserves included $6,187 million of reported average, case and case development reserves and $2,374 million of IBNR reserves. GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance which has a relatively short claim-tail. The key assumptions affecting the setting of our reserves include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”), which includes loss adjustment expenses. Our reserving methodologies produce reserve estimates based upon the individual claims (or a “ground-up” approach), which yields an aggregate estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Ranges of loss estimates are not determined in the aggregate. Our actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserves using recognized standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The significant reserve components (and percentage of gross reserves) are: (1) average reserves (20%), (2) case and case development reserves (55%) and (3) IBNR reserves (25%). Each component of loss reserves is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. Such amounts are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, rated state, reporting date and occurrence date, among other factors. A brief discussion of each reserve component follows. We establish average reserve amounts for reported auto damage claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. The average reserves are established as a reasonable estimate for incurred claims for which our claims adjusters have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that are paid within a relatively short time after being reported. Average reserve amounts are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened. Our claims adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as soon as the specific facts and merits of each claim can be evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised as more information becomes known. For most liability coverages, case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim-tail, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is established. Therefore, we establish additional case development reserve estimates, which are usually percentages of the case reserve. As of December 31, 2009, case development reserves averaged approximately 20% of total established case reserves. In general, case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves. Case development factors are reviewed and revised periodically. For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts to develop 48 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are subtracted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established through the collaborative effort of actuarial, claims and other management. For each of GEICO’s major coverages, we test the adequacy of the total loss reserves using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Loss reserve estimates recorded at the end of 2008 developed downward by $194 million when reevaluated through December 31, 2009, producing a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2009. These downward reserve developments represented approximately 1% of earned premiums in 2009 and approximately 2.6% of the prior year-end reserve amount. Reserving assumptions at December 31, 2009 were modified appropriately to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future reserve development will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated. Within the automobile line of business, reserves for liability coverages are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails. Approximately 90% of GEICO’s reserves as of December 31, 2009 were for automobile liability, of which bodily injury (“BI”) coverage accounted for approximately 55%. We believe it is reasonably possible that the average BI severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used. If actual BI severity changes one percentage point from what was used in establishing the reserves, our reserves would develop up or down by approximately $124 million resulting in a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to be different from expected would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. Our exposure in GEICO to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining reserves associated with such exposure are currently a relatively insignificant component of GEICO’s total reserves (approximately 2%) and there is minimal apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure. Related claim activity over the past year was insignificant. General Re and BHRG Property and casualty loss reserves of our General Re and BHRG underwriting units derive primarily from assumed reinsurance. Additional uncertainties are unique to loss reserving processes for reinsurance. The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which are affected by market conditions and practices) and other factors. Due to the lack of standardization of contract terms and conditions, the wide variability of coverage needs of individual clients and the tendency for those needs to change rapidly in response to market conditions, the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainties, in and of themselves, cannot be reliably measured. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative, per occurrence excess contracts or retroactive contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract. This occurs when company personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. Loss information from aggregate excess-of-loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Occasionally, loss information is reported in summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is provided through periodic reports and may include the amount of ceded losses paid where reimbursement is sought as well as case loss reserve estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers. Each of our reinsurance businesses has established practices to identify and gather needed information from clients. These practices include, for example, comparison of expected premiums to reported premiums to help identify delinquent client periodic reports and claim reviews to facilitate loss reporting and identify inaccurate or incomplete claim reporting. These practices are periodically evaluated and changed as conditions, risk factors and unanticipated areas of exposures are identified. 49 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re and BHRG (Continued) The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is delayed in comparison with primary insurance. In some instances there are multiple reinsurers assuming and ceding parts of an underlying risk causing multiple contractual intermediaries between us and the primary insured. In these instances, the delays in reporting can be compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer varies depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms and other factors. Contracts covering casualty losses on a per occurrence excess basis may experience longer delays in reporting due to the length of the claim-tail as regards to the underlying claim. In addition, ceding companies may not report claims to the reinsurer until they believe it is reasonably possible that the reinsurer will be affected, usually determined as a function of its estimate of the claim amount as a percentage of the reinsurance contract retention. However, the timing of reporting large per occurrence excess property losses or property catastrophe losses may not vary significantly from primary insurance. Under contracts where periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies, such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals which in the U.S. range from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. Outside the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices vary. In certain countries clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. The different client reporting practices generally do not result in a significant increase in risk or uncertainty as the actuarial reserving methodologies are adjusted to compensate for the delays. Premium and loss data is provided to us through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data provided is incomplete, inaccurate or outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Reinsurance contracts generally allow us to have access to the cedant’s books and records with respect to the subject business and provide us the ability to conduct audits to determine the accuracy and completeness of information. Audits are conducted as we deem them appropriate. In the normal course of business, disputes with clients occasionally arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under the reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through the involvement of our claims department personnel and the appropriate client personnel or by independent outside counsel. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or alternative dispute resolution will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In summary, the scope, number and potential variability of assumptions required in estimating ultimate losses from reinsurance contracts are more uncertain than primary property and casualty insurance due to the factors previously discussed.

Our loss reserve estimation process is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (“ACRs”) and IBNR reserves. Critical judgments in establishing loss reserves involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the expectation of ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and comparison of case reserve reporting trends to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded reserve amounts are subject to “tail risk” where reported losses develop beyond the maximum expected loss emergence pattern time period. We do not routinely determine loss reserve ranges because we believe that the techniques necessary have not sufficiently developed and the myriad of assumptions required render such resulting ranges to be unreliable. In addition, counts of claims or average amounts per claim are not utilized because clients do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail. Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, our claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners’ estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners’ estimates are significantly greater than the ceding company’s estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACRs are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2009, ACRs aggregated $3.0 billion before discounts and were concentrated in workers’ compensation reserves, and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. Our examiners also periodically conduct detailed claim reviews of individual clients and case reserves are often increased as a result. In 2009, we conducted about 330 claim reviews. Our actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (“reserve cells”) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative and program) and line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, etc.). For each reserve cell, premiums and losses are aggregated by accident year, policy year or underwriting year (depending on client reporting practices) and analyzed over time. We internally refer to these loss aggregations as loss triangles, which serve as the primary basis for our IBNR reserve calculations. We review over 300 reserve cells for our North American business and approximately 900 reserve cells with respect to our international business. We use loss triangles to determine the expected case loss emergence patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, loss triangles are further used to determine IBNR reserves. While additional calculations form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern, the determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly a mechanical process. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, we use estimation formulas along with reliance on other loss triangles and judgment. Factors affecting our loss development triangles include but are not limited to the following: changes in client claims practices, changes in claim examiners’ use of ACRs or the frequency of client company claim reviews, changes in policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. Collectively, these factors influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns. We select expected loss ratios by reserve cell, by accident year, based upon reviewing forecasted losses and indicated ultimate loss ratios that are predicted from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premium. If the selected emergence pattern is not accurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios may not be accurate, which can affect the selected loss ratios and hence the IBNR reserve. As with selected loss emergence patterns, selecting expected loss ratios is not a strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing loss ratios. We estimate IBNR reserves by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, our actuaries calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year. These calculations do not involve new assumptions and use the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year. In 2009, for prior years’ workers’ compensation losses, our reported claims were less than expected claims by about $186 million. However, further analysis of the workers’ compensation reserve cells by segment indicated the need for additional IBNR. These developments precipitated about $133 million of a net increase in nominal IBNR reserve estimates for unreported 51 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) occurrences. After deducting $148 million for the change in net reserve discounts during the year, workers’ compensation losses from prior years reduced pre-tax earnings in 2009 by $95 million. To illustrate the sensitivity of changes in expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios for our significant excess-of-loss workers’ compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves of approximately $704 million and $408 million on a discounted basis as of December 31, 2009. The increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates. Our other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) were favorable in 2009 relative to expectations. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given year means that loss reserve amounts currently established will continue to develop favorably. For our significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells (including medical malpractice, umbrella, auto and general liability), an increase of five points in the tails of the expected emergence patterns and an increase of five percent in expected loss ratios (one percent for large international proportional reserve cells) would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $922 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $922 million. Our property losses were lower than expected in 2009 but the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses. In response to favorable claim developments and another year of information, estimated remaining World Trade Center losses were reduced by $17 million. In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (“D&O and E&O”) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected emergence patterns. These cells often involve a spike in loss activity arising from recent industry developments making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern. For our large D&O and E&O reserve cells an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern (for those cells where emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $220 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates. Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, “mass tort”) claims. Unpaid mass tort reserves at December 31, 2009 were approximately $1.7 billion gross and $1.3 billion net of reinsurance. Such reserves were approximately $1.8 billion gross and $1.2 billion net of reinsurance as of December 31, 2008. Mass tort net claims paid were about $87 million in 2009. In 2009, ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims were increased by $83 million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider “survival ratios” based on net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. The survival ratio based on claims payments made over the last three years was approximately 14.5 years as of December 31, 2009. The insurance industry’s comparable survival ratio for asbestos and pollution reserves was approximately 8 years. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. 52 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG BHRG’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2009 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions. Property Casualty Total Reported case reserves $ 1,524 $ 2,669 $ 4,193 IBNR reserves 1,889 4,054 5,943 Retroactive — 17,973 17,973 Gross reserves $ 3,413 $ 24,696 28,109 Deferred charges and ceded reserves (4,964 ) Net reserves $ 23,145 A discussion of our loss reserve estimation processes used by our BHRG underwriting unit follows. In general, the methodologies we use to establish loss reserves vary widely and encompass many of the common methodologies employed in the actuarial field today. Certain traditional methodologies such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques are utilized as well as ground-up techniques where appropriate. Additional judgments must also be employed to consider changes in contract conditions and terms as well as the incidence of litigation or legal and regulatory change. As of December 31, 2009, our gross loss reserves related to retroactive reinsurance policies were predominantly casualty losses. Our retroactive policies include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses (relating to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date) above a contractual retention are indemnified or contracts that indemnify all losses paid by the counterparty after the policy effective date. We paid retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses of $1.1 billion in 2009. The classification “reported case reserves” has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since the amount is often derived from reports in bulk from ceding companies, who may have inconsistent definitions of “case reserves.” We review and establish loss reserve estimates, including estimates of IBNR reserves, in the aggregate by contract. In establishing retroactive reinsurance reserves, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. We assign judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, we reassess expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process. During 2009, retroactive reserves developed upward by approximately $420 million. Our liabilities for environmental, asbestos, and latent injury losses and loss adjustment expenses are presently concentrated within retroactive reinsurance contracts. Reserves for such losses were approximately $9.1 billion at December 31, 2009 and $9.2 billion at December 31, 2008. We paid losses in 2009 attributable to these exposures of approximately $600 million. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not regularly receive reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies on a consistent basis, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, we conduct a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data of the reinsured to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, our estimates can only be developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. Potential legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on establishing loss reserves for mass tort claims in the future. The maximum losses payable under our retroactive policies are not expected to exceed approximately $29 billion as of December 31, 2009. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we currently believe it unlikely that unpaid losses as of December 31, 2009 ($18.0 billion) will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15%. 53 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG (Continued) A significant number of our reinsurance contracts are expected to have a low frequency of claim occurrence combined with a potential for high severity of claims. These include property losses from catastrophes, terrorism and aviation risks under catastrophe and individual risk contracts. Loss reserves related to catastrophe and individual risk contracts were approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2009, a decline of about $200 million from December 31, 2008. In 2009 and 2008, loss reserves for prior years’ events declined by approximately $280 million and $200 million, respectively, which produced corresponding increases to pre-tax earnings each year. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Catastrophe loss reserves are provided when it is probable that an insured loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event. Other reinsurance reserve amounts are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on an individual contract basis, supplemented by management’s judgment of the impact on each contract of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon management’s judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding company’s loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared. Derivative contract liabilities Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant amounts of derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. Our significant derivative contract exposures are concentrated in credit default and equity index put option contracts. These contracts were primarily entered into in over-the-counter markets and certain elements in the terms and conditions of such contracts are not standardized. In particular, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. Furthermore, there is no source of independent data available to us showing trading volume and actual prices of completed transactions. As a result, the values of these liabilities are primarily based on valuation models, discounted cash flow models or other valuation techniques that are believed to be used by market participants. Such models or other valuation techniques may use inputs that are observable in the marketplace, while others are unobservable. Unobservable inputs require us to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in establishing prices. Considerable judgment may be required in making assumptions, including the selection of interest rates, default and recovery rates and volatility. Changes in assumptions may have a significant effect on values. For these reasons, we classify our credit default and equity index put option contracts as Level 3 measurements under GAAP. The fair values of our high yield credit default contracts are primarily based on indications of bid/ask pricing data. The bid/ask data represents non-binding indications of prices for which similar contracts would be exchanged. Pricing data for the high yield index contracts is obtained from one to three sources depending on the particular index. For the single name and municipal issuer credit default contracts, our fair values are generally based on credit default spread information obtained from a widely used reporting source. We monitor and review pricing data for consistency as well as reasonableness with respect to current market conditions. We generally base estimated fair value on the ask prices (the average of such prices if more than one indication is obtained). We make no significant adjustments to the pricing data referred to above. Further, we make no significant adjustments to fair value for non-performance risk. We concluded that the values produced from this data (without adjustment) reasonably represented the value for which we could have transferred these liabilities. However, our contract terms (particularly the lack of collateral posting requirements) likely preclude any transfer of the contracts to third parties. Accordingly, prices in a current actual settlement or transfer could differ significantly from the fair values used in the financial statements. We do not operate as a derivatives dealer and currently we do not utilize offsetting strategies to hedge these contracts. We intend to allow our credit default contracts to run off to their respective expiration dates. Pricing data for newer high yield credit default contracts tends to vary little among the different pricing sources, which we believe indicates that trading of such contracts is relatively active. As contracts age towards their expiration dates, the variations in pricing data can widen, which we believe is indicative of less active markets. However, the impact of such variations is partially mitigated by shorter remaining durations, lower exposures due to losses paid to date and by the relatively greater 54 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Derivative contract liabilities (Continued) availability of data on newer contracts, which is used for comparison. We entered into one credit default contract in 2009, while several contracts expired or terminated. Accordingly, our remaining risk under credit default contracts has declined from year end 2008. We determine the estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts based on the widely used Black-Scholes option valuation model. Inputs to the model include the current index value, strike price, discount rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted average discount and dividend rates used as of December 31, 2009 were 4.0% and 2.7%, respectively, and were each approximately 4.0% as of December 31, 2008. The discount rates as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately 55 basis points and 125 basis points (on a weighted average basis), respectively, over benchmark interest rates and represented an estimate of the spread between our borrowing rates and the benchmark rates for comparable durations. The spread adjustments were based on spreads for our obligations and obligations for comparably rated issuers. We believe the most significant economic risks relate to changes in the index value component and to a lesser degree to the foreign currency component. For additional information, see our Market Risk Disclosures. The Black-Scholes model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. The weighted average volatility used as of December 31, 2009 was approximately 22%, which was relatively unchanged from year end 2008. The weighted average volatilities are based on the volatility input for each equity index put option contract weighted by the notional value of each equity index put option contract as compared to the aggregate notional value of all equity index put option contracts. The volatility input for each equity index put option contract is based upon the implied volatility at the inception of each equity index put option contract. The impact on fair value as of December 31, 2009 ($7.3 billion) from changes in volatility is summarized below. The values of contracts in an actual exchange are affected by market conditions and perceptions of the buyers and sellers. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model. Dollars are in millions. Hypothetical change in volatility (percentage points) Hypothetical fair value Increase 2 percentage points $ 7,885 Increase 4 percentage points 8,459 Decrease 2 percentage points 6,734 Decrease 4 percentage points 6,163 Other Critical Accounting Policies We record deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the difference between the consideration received and the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss expenses. Deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of loss payments. Adjustments to these assumptions are applied retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were $4.0 billion at December 31, 2009. Significant changes in the estimated amount and payment timing of unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately $34.0 billion. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and conducted an annual review in the fourth quarter. Such tests include determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and performing goodwill impairment tests. There are several methods of estimating a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may involve forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures as well as an appropriate discount rate. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual future results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then individual assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is then charged to earnings as an impairment loss. 55 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility, particularly over the short term. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Interest Rate Risk We regularly invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur with respect to assets. We strive to maintain high credit ratings so that the cost of debt is minimized. We utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks on a limited basis. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate investments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate investments. The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that no other significant factors change that determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices and prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments may be concentrated in relatively few investees. At December 31, 2009, approximately 60% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated in five investees. We prefer to hold equity investments for very long periods of time so we are not troubled by short-term equity price volatility with respect to our investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. We strive to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short-term equity price volatility. Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate potential loss with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between contract inception date and expiration, the change in fair value resulting from current changes in the index values are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract. These contracts generally expire 15 to 20 years from inception and may not be settled before their respective expiration dates. The following table summarizes our equity investments and derivative contract liabilities with equity price risk as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. The effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates is also shown. The selected 30% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

Excludes investments accounted for under the equity method. Foreign Currency Risk We generally do not use derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency price changes primarily because of the natural hedging that occurs between assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in the consolidated financial statements. Financial statements of subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. Dollar as their functional currency are translated into U.S. Dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in earnings primarily as a result of the translation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities held by our U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, we hold investments in major multinational companies that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own, such as The Coca-Cola Company. 57 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Foreign Currency Risk (Continued) Our net assets subject to translation are primarily in our insurance and utilities and energy businesses, and to a lesser extent in our manufacturing and services businesses. The translation impact is somewhat offset by transaction gains or losses on net reinsurance liabilities denominated in foreign currencies of certain U.S. subsidiaries as well as the equity index put option liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries relating to contracts that would be settled in foreign currencies. Commodity Price Risk Through our ownership of MidAmerican, we are subject to commodity price risk. Exposures include variations in the price of wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold, fuel costs to generate electricity and natural gas supply for regulated retail gas customers. Electricity and natural gas prices are subject to wide price swings as demand responds to, among many other items, changing weather, limited storage, transmission and transportation constraints, and lack of alternative supplies from other areas. To mitigate a portion of the risk, MidAmerican uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Accordingly, gains and losses associated with interim price movements on such contracts are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Financial results may be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. MidAmerican also uses futures, options and swap agreements to economically hedge gas and electric commodity prices for physical delivery to non-regulated customers. MidAmerican does not engage in a material amount of proprietary trading activities. The table that follows summarizes our commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of MidAmerican as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of that date. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Dollars are in millions.

Forward-looking statements include statements that are predictive in nature, that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, that include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects, and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions about us, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guaranties of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane or an act of terrorism that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries, changes in insurance laws or regulations, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. 58 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on the following page.

Amounts are in millions. 2010 2009 2008 Insurance – underwriting $ 1,301 $ 949 $ 1,739 Insurance – investment income 3,860 4,271 3,610 Railroad 2,235 * — — Utilities and energy 1,131 1,071 1,704 Manufacturing, service and retailing 2,462 1,113 2,283 Finance and financial products 441 411 469 Other (337 ) (246 ) (166 ) Investment and derivative gains/losses 1,874 486 (4,645 ) Net earnings attributable to Berkshire $ 12,967 $ 8,055 $ 4,994 * Earnings are for the period between February 13 and December 31, 2010. Our operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our corporate senior management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. On February 12, 2010, we completed the acquisition of the 77.5% of BNSF common stock that we did not already own. Beginning as of February 13, 2010, BNSF’s results and net earnings are included fully in our consolidated results and net earnings. In 2009 and until February 12, 2010, our share of net earnings related to our previously held investments in BNSF, as determined under the equity method, is included as a component of insurance investment income in the preceding table. Over the last half of 2008 and throughout 2009, operating results of many of our businesses were adversely impacted by the world-wide economic recession. While our two largest business segments, which in 2009 were insurance and utilities, remained strong and operating results were not negatively impacted in any significant way by the recession, earnings of most of our diverse group of manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined during 2009 as compared to the preceding two years. The effects from the economic recession resulted in lower sales volume and profit margins as consumers significantly curtailed spending, particularly for discretionary items. In 2010, operating results for many of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses improved versus 2009, reflecting some stabilization of economic conditions. In 2010, we realized after-tax investment and derivative gains of approximately $1.9 billion. The gains included a one-time holding gain of $979 million related to our acquisition of BNSF, net realized gains from the dispositions of investments, and net gains from derivative contracts, partially offset by non-cash other-than-temporary impairment losses recorded with respect to certain fixed maturity and equity securities. In 2009, we realized after-tax investment and derivative gains of $486 million, while in 2008 we had losses of approximately $4.6 billion. In 2009 and 2008, the gains and losses primarily derived from credit default contracts, dispositions of equity securities, other-than-temporary impairment losses with respect to certain equity securities and changes in estimated fair values of long duration equity index put option contracts. Changes in the equity and credit markets from period to period can and have caused significant volatility in periodic earnings. In response to the crises in the financial markets and the global recession, the U.S. government and governments around the world are taking measures to regulate financial institutions, stabilize financial markets (including over-the-counter derivatives markets) and stimulate economic activity. In the United States, regulatory reform legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The ultimate impact that these governmental actions will have on us is not entirely certain at this time. Our operating companies have taken and will continue to take actions as necessary to manage through the current economic situation and to improve our operations for the long-term. We continue to believe that the economic franchises of our operating businesses remain intact. We anticipate that general economic conditions will continue to gradually improve, albeit unevenly, over time. 29 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Through General Re and BHRG, we also reinsure life and health risks. We view insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing, with limited exceptions, is the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income. Our periodic underwriting results can be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. In addition, the timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results. Our underwriting results also include significant unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the periodic revaluation of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities into U.S. Dollars as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. A key marketing strategy followed by all of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $94 billion at December 31, 2010. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers. Underwriting results from our insurance businesses are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. 2010 2009 2008 Underwriting gain attributable to: GEICO $ 1,117 $ 649 $ 916 General Re 452 477 342 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 176 250 1,222 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 268 84 210 Pre-tax underwriting gain 2,013 1,460 2,690 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 712 511 951 Net underwriting gain $ 1,301 $ 949 $ 1,739 GEICO Through GEICO, we primarily write private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO’s policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. This is a significant element in our strategy to be a low-cost auto insurer. In addition, we strive to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICO’s underwriting results are summarized below. Dollars are in millions. 2010 2009 2008 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 14,494 $ 13,758 $ 12,741 Premiums earned $ 14,283 100.0 $ 13,576 100.0 $ 12,479 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 10,631 74.4 10,457 77.0 9,332 74.8 Underwriting expenses 2,535 17.8 2,470 18.2 2,231 17.9 Total losses and expenses 13,166 92.2 12,927 95.2 11,563 92.7 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 1,117 $ 649 $ 916 30 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Premiums earned in 2010 increased $707 million (5.2%) over 2009. The growth in premiums earned for voluntary auto was 5.3% in 2010, reflecting a 5.9% increase in policies-in-force over the past year. Premiums earned in 2010 also reflected a very slight increase in average premiums per policy over the year, although by the end of 2010 average premiums per policy declined to year-end 2009 levels. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2010 declined 2.6% from relatively high levels during 2009 when new business sales increased 9.0% versus 2008. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2010 were approximately 563,000 greater than at December 31, 2009. The strong growth that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2010 when voluntary auto policies-in-force grew by about 165,000 is continuing. As of February 21, 2011, voluntary auto policies-in-force grew by about 188,500 since year-end. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2010 increased 1.7% over amounts incurred in 2009. The loss ratio was 74.4% in 2010 compared to 77.0% in 2009. The lower loss ratio in 2010 reflected the favorable impact of increased premium volume which was partially offset by changes in claim frequencies and severities. Claims frequencies in 2010 for property damage and collision coverages increased in the one to two percent range versus 2009, while frequencies for comprehensive coverages rose in the five to seven percent range from 2009 due to higher numbers of glass claims. Injury claims frequencies increased in the two to four percent range versus 2009. Claim severities in 2010 for physical damage coverages rose in the two to four percent range compared to 2009, while injury severities increased in the three to seven percent range. Incurred losses from catastrophe events in 2010 were $109 million compared to $83 million in 2009. Underwriting expenses incurred in 2010 increased 2.6% versus 2009 and primarily reflected increased advertising. Premiums earned in 2009 increased $1,097 million (8.8%) over 2008, reflecting growth in voluntary auto premiums earned as a result of an overall increase in policies-in-force of 7.8%. Policies-in-force grew more rapidly in the latter part of 2008 and the early part of 2009 and moderated over the remainder of 2009. As a result, premiums earned in 2009 increased at a higher rate than policies-in-force, despite a slight decline in premiums per policy. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2009 were 684,000 greater than at December 31, 2008. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2009 increased $1,125 million (12.1%) compared with 2008. The loss ratio was 77.0% in 2009 compared to 74.8% in 2008. The higher loss ratio in 2009 reflected overall increases in claim frequencies and injury claim severities. Claims frequencies in 2009 for physical damage coverages increased in the one to two percent range, while frequencies for injury coverages increased in the five to seven percent range compared with the very low frequency levels in 2008. Injury severities in 2009 increased in the three to five percent range while physical damage severities decreased in the two to four percent range from 2008. Incurred losses from catastrophe events in 2009 of $83 million were relatively unchanged from 2008. Underwriting expenses in 2009 increased $239 million (10.7%) due primarily to higher policy issuance costs and increased salary and employee benefit expenses, which included increased interest on deferred compensation liabilities. General Re Through General Re, we conduct a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. We write property and casualty reinsurance in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Germany-based General Reinsurance AG (formerly named Cologne Re) and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG. General Re strives to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines, without consideration of investment income. Our management does not evaluate underwriting performance based upon market share and our underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Re’s underwriting results are summarized in the following table. Amounts are in millions. Premiums written Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Property/casualty $ 2,923 $ 3,091 $ 3,383 $ 2,979 $ 3,203 $ 3,434 $ 289 $ 300 $ 163 Life/health 2,709 2,630 2,588 2,714 2,626 2,580 163 177 179 $ 5,632 $ 5,721 $ 5,971 $ 5,693 $ 5,829 $ 6,014 $ 452 $ 477 $ 342 31 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Property/casualty Premiums written in 2010 declined $168 million (5.4%) from 2009, while premiums earned in 2010 declined $224 million (7.0%) from 2009. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written and earned in 2010 declined $202 million (6.5%) and $169 million (5.3%), respectively, compared with 2009. Premiums written and earned in 2010 reflected decreased volume as price competition in most property and casualty lines has led to decreases in premium volume over the past several years. Our underwriters continue to maintain discipline by rejecting inadequately priced offerings. Increased price competition and capacity within the industry could continue to constrain premium volume during 2011. Underwriting gains were $289 million in 2010 and consisted of gains of $236 million from property business and $53 million from casualty/workers’ compensation business. The property business produced underwriting losses of $96 million for the 2010 accident year, offset by gains of $332 million from loss reserve reductions related to loss events occurring before 2010. The property results in 2010 were net of $339 million of catastrophe losses incurred primarily from the Chilean and New Zealand earthquakes and weather-related losses in Europe, Australia and New England. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual losses produces significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. The underwriting gains of $53 million from casualty/workers’ compensation business reflected overall reductions in prior years’ loss reserve estimates offset in part by $125 million of workers’ compensation loss reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization. Premiums written and earned in 2009 declined $292 million (8.6%) and $231 million (6.7%), respectively, from 2008. Premiums in 2008 included $205 million with respect to a reinsurance-to-close transaction that increased our economic interest in the run-off of Lloyd’s Syndicate 435’s 2000 year of account from 39% to 100%. Under the reinsurance-to-close transaction, we also assumed a corresponding amount of net loss reserves and as a result, there was no impact on net underwriting gains in 2008. There was no similar transaction in 2009. Excluding the reinsurance-to-close transaction and the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written and earned in 2009 increased $149 million (4.7%) and $107 million (3.3%), respectively, compared to 2008, primarily due to increased volume in European treaty and Lloyd’s market property business. Underwriting results in 2009 included underwriting gains of $478 million from property business and losses of $178 million from casualty/workers’ compensation business. The property business produced underwriting gains of $173 million for the 2009 accident year, and $305 million from loss reserve reductions related to loss events occurring before 2009. The property gains in 2009 were net of $48 million of losses from catastrophes, which were primarily from winter storm Klaus in Europe, the Victoria bushfires in Australia and an earthquake in Italy. The underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business were primarily the result of establishing higher loss reserves for 2009 accident year occurrences to reflect higher loss trends as well as $118 million of workers’ compensation loss reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, offset in part by reserve reductions related to prior years’ casualty/workers’ compensation loss reserves. Underwriting results in 2008 included $275 million in underwriting gains from property business partially offset by $112 million in underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business. The property business produced underwriting losses of $120 million for the 2008 accident year, offset by $395 million of gains from loss reserve reductions related to loss events occurring before 2008. The 2008 accident year results included $174 million of catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and $56 million of catastrophe losses from European storms. The underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business in 2008 included $117 million of workers’ compensation loss reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, offset in part by reserve reductions related to prior years’ other casualty lines. The casualty results were also adversely impacted by legal costs incurred in connection with regulatory investigations. Life/health Premiums earned in 2010 increased 3.4% over 2009, which increased 1.8% over 2008. Adjusting for the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums earned increased 4.8% over 2009, which increased 4.7% over 2008. The increases in premiums earned since 2008 were primarily due to increased international business. Underwriting results for the global life/health operations produced underwriting gains of $163 million in 2010, $177 million in 2009 and $179 million in 2008. Overall results were profitable in each of the past three years driven by gains from the life business due primarily to favorable mortality. 32 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group Through the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, we underwrite excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages on property and casualty risks for insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG’s business includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and excess primary and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual discrete property risks referred to as individual risk. BHRG also writes retroactive reinsurance, which provides indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Other multi-line business refers to other property and casualty business written on both a quota-share and excess basis. Beginning in 2010, BHRG’s underwriting activities include life reinsurance as well as a life annuity business, which in previous years was included in the finance and financial products segment. Amounts for 2009 and 2008 have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. BHRG’s underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in millions. Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain/loss 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Catastrophe and individual risk $ 623 $ 823 $ 955 $ 260 $ 782 $ 776 Retroactive reinsurance 2,621 1,989 204 (90 ) (448 ) (414 ) Other multi-line 3,459 3,894 3,923 203 15 962 Life and annuity 2,373 — — (197 ) (99 ) (102 ) $ 9,076 $ 6,706 $ 5,082 $ 176 $ 250 $ 1,222 Catastrophe and individual risk contracts may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification and cover catastrophe risks (such as hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters) or other property and liability risks. The timing and magnitude of losses produces extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results of this business. Catastrophe and individual risk premiums written were approximately $584 million in 2010, $725 million in 2009 and $1.1 billion in 2008. The level of business that we write in a given period will vary significantly due to changes in market conditions and our management’s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. We constrained the volume of business written in 2010 as premium rates have not been attractive enough to warrant increasing volume. However, we have the capacity and willingness to write substantially more business when appropriate pricing can be obtained. Premiums earned from catastrophe and individual risk contracts in 2010 declined 24% from 2009 which declined 14% from 2008. Underwriting results from catastrophe and individual risk business in 2010 included estimated losses of $322 million arising from several significant property catastrophe and casualty loss occurrences in 2010. Underwriting results in 2009 reflected no significant losses from catastrophes during the year, while in 2008 we incurred approximately $270 million of estimated losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Underwriting results in 2008 also included a gain of $224 million from a contract in which we agreed to purchase, under certain conditions, up to $4 billion of revenue bonds issued by the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund Finance Corporation. Our obligation was conditioned upon, among other things, the occurrence of a specified amount of Florida hurricane losses during a period that expired on December 31, 2008 and which was not met. Retroactive reinsurance policies generally provide very large, but limited, indemnification of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events that are generally expected to be paid over long periods of time. Premiums earned in 2010 included approximately $2.25 billion from a reinsurance contract entered into with Continental Casualty Company, a subsidiary of CNA Financial Corporation, and several of its other insurance subsidiaries (collectively the “CNA Companies”). Under the terms of the reinsurance contract, BHRG assumed certain asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities of the CNA Companies subject to an aggregate limit of indemnification of $4 billion of covered losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses. The premiums earned related to this contract were offset by a corresponding amount of losses incurred (comprised of estimated loss reserves of approximately $2.45 billion less a deferred charge asset of approximately $200 million), thus resulting in no immediate impact on underwriting results. Premiums earned from retroactive reinsurance in 2009 included 2.0 billion Swiss Francs (approximately $1.7 billion) from an adverse loss development contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. and its affiliates (“Swiss Re”) covering substantially all of Swiss Re’s non-life insurance losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses for loss events occurring prior to January 1, 2009. Underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance include the recurring amortization of deferred charges that are established with respect to these contracts. At the inception of a contract, deferred charges represent the difference between the premium received and the estimated ultimate losses payable. Deferred charges are subsequently amortized over the estimated claims 33 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) payment period using the interest method and are based on estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments. Amortization charges are recorded as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. The relatively low underwriting losses in 2010 reflected the impact of net reductions in ultimate reserve estimates on certain large contracts and generally slower than expected loss payments, which resulted in lower rates of deferred charge amortization. At December 31, 2010, unamortized deferred charges for all of BHRG’s retroactive contracts were approximately $3.7 billion and gross unpaid losses were approximately $18.7 billion. Other multi-line property and casualty premiums earned included $2.4 billion in 2010, $2.8 billion in 2009 and $1.8 billion in 2008 from a 20% quota-share reinsurance contract with Swiss Re covering substantially all of Swiss Re’s property/casualty risks incepting from January 1, 2008 and running through December 31, 2012. Excluding the Swiss Re quota-share contract, premiums earned in 2010 from other multi-line business declined $75 million (7%) from 2009, which declined $969 million (46%) compared to 2008. Underwriting results from other multi-line business are affected by the timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses and unrealized foreign currency transactions. Underwriting results in 2010 for our other multi-line business included estimated catastrophe losses of approximately $308 million from the Chilean and New Zealand earthquakes, the Gulf of Mexico BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion and the Australian floods. There were no significant catastrophe losses in 2009. Underwriting results in 2008 included approximately $435 million of estimated catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Underwriting results also included losses of approximately $168 million in 2010 and $280 million in 2009 and gains of approximately $930 million in 2008 from unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the conversion of certain reinsurance loss reserves and other liabilities denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars as of the balance sheet dates. Excluding the effects of the currency gains/losses, other multi-line business produced underwriting gains of $371 million in 2010, $295 million in 2009 and $32 million in 2008. In January 2010, BHRG entered in to a life reinsurance contract with Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc. (“SRLHA”). Under the agreement, BHRG assumed the liabilities and subsequent renewal premiums associated with a closed block of yearly renewable term reinsurance business reinsuring permanent and term products and universal life products written, assumed or subsequently acquired by SRLHA. BHRG assumes the mortality risk on the underlying lives with respect to the SRLHA business effective as of October 1, 2009, until the underlying yearly renewable term reinsured policy non-renews or the insurer ceding the business to SRLHA recaptures the business. Premiums earned in 2010 from this contract were $2.1 billion and underwriting losses were $83 million. The agreement is expected to remain in-force for several decades and, over time, is expected to result in substantial premiums earned and life benefits incurred. The underwriting results of the life and annuity business also included periodic interest charges arising from accretion of discounted annuity reserves. At December 31, 2010, the net reserves for all life and annuity benefits were approximately $2.8 billion. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group Our primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses that principally write liability coverages for commercial accounts. These businesses include: Medical Protective Corporation (“MedPro”), a provider of professional liability insurance to physicians, dentists and other healthcare providers; National Indemnity Company’s primary group (“NICO Primary Group”), writers of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as “Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies,” providers of standard commercial multi-line insurance; Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers’ compensation solutions; and BoatU.S., a writer of insurance for owners of boats and small watercraft. Earned premiums by our primary insurance businesses were $1.7 billion in 2010, $1.8 billion in 2009 and $2.0 billion in 2008. Premium volume of our primary insurers, in general, has been and continues to be constrained by soft market conditions and as a result, we are accepting less business. Underwriting gains as percentages of premiums earned were approximately 16% in 2010, 5% in 2009 and 11% in 2008. The improvement in underwriting results was primarily due to reductions of MedPro’s estimated prior years’ loss reserves and lower loss ratios of the Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies. 34 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income of our insurance operations follows. Amounts are in millions. 2010 2009 2008 Investment income before taxes, noncontrolling interests and equity method earnings $ 5,145 $ 5,459 $ 4,896 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,335 1,615 1,286 Net investment income before equity method earnings 3,810 3,844 3,610 Equity method earnings 50 427 — Net investment income $ 3,860 $ 4,271 $ 3,610 Investment income consists of interest and dividends earned on cash and cash equivalents and investments attributable to our insurance businesses. Pre-tax investment income declined $314 million (5.8%) compared with 2009. The decline in 2010 investment income reflected lower dividends earned from our investments in Wells Fargo common stock and the impact of a realized gain in 2009 of about $100 million from a short-term currency transaction made in anticipation of our investment in the Swiss Re convertible capital instrument. Pre-tax investment income in 2009 exceeded 2008 by $563 million (11.5%). The increase in investment income in 2009 primarily reflected earnings from several large investments made in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first half of 2009, partially offset by lower earnings on cash and cash equivalents due to lower short-term interest rates and lower average cash balances. In October 2008, we acquired 11.45% subordinated notes and 5% preferred stock issued by Wrigley and preferred stocks of Goldman Sachs and General Electric that each pay an annual dividend of 10%. In March 2009, we acquired a 12% convertible capital instrument of Swiss Re and in April 2009, we acquired an 8.5% Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock of Dow. In December 2009, we also acquired $1.0 billion par amount of senior notes issued by Wrigley. Approximately 85% of these securities were acquired by our insurance group, with the remainder primarily held in our finance and financial products businesses. Our insurance group earned about $1.8 billion in 2010 and $1.7 billion in 2009 in interest and dividends from the aforementioned investments. Our investment income in 2011 may decline as compared to 2010 as a result of maturities and redemptions of higher yielding investments that occurred in 2010 and are expected to occur in 2011 and low interest rates currently available for reinvestment purposes. As a result, our cash and cash equivalent balances will likely increase during 2011. In November 2010, an agreement was entered into with Swiss Re providing for the redemption of the 12% capital instrument for aggregate consideration of approximately CHF 3.9 billion. In addition, our investment in Goldman Sachs preferred stock may be redeemed at the option of Goldman Sachs at any time and our investment in General Electric preferred stock may be redeemed at the option of General Electric beginning in October 2011. We anticipate that both of these securities will be redeemed in 2011. The negative impact on investment income from these events may be partially offset to the extent that dividend rates increase with respect to certain of our major common stock investments. Insurance investment income also includes earnings from equity method investments (BNSF and Moody’s). Equity method earnings represented our proportionate share of the net earnings of these companies. As a result of a reduction of our ownership of Moody’s in July of 2009, we discontinued the use of the equity method for our investment in Moody’s as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2009. As a result of our acquisition of the remaining outstanding stock of BNSF on February 12, 2010, we discontinued the use of the equity method and BNSF’s accounts are now included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning as of February 13, 2010. Dividends received on equity method investments are not reflected in our earnings. Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $66 billion at December 31, 2010, $63 billion at December 31, 2009 and $60 billion at December 31, 2008, respectively. The cost of float, as represented by the ratio of underwriting gain or loss to average float, was negative for the last three years, as our insurance business generated underwriting gains in each year. 35 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses follows.

Non-investment grade securities represent securities that are rated below BBB- or Baa3. Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) We acquired control of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation (“BNSF”) on February 12, 2010. BNSF’s revenues and operating results are included in our consolidated results beginning immediately after the acquisition. In 2009 and for the period between January 1, 2010 and February 12, 2010, we accounted for our interest in BNSF pursuant to the equity method. Our share of BNSF’s earnings for those periods is included in net investment income of our insurance group. Earnings of BNSF following the acquisition are summarized below (in millions). BNSF’s earnings for the years ending December 31, 2010 and 2009 are provided for comparison, although these results are not consolidated in our financial statements. Feb. 13, 2010 toDec. 31, 2010 2010 2009 Revenues $ 15,059 $ 16,850 $ 14,016 Operating expenses 11,013 12,355 10,762 Interest expense 435 507 613 11,448 12,862 11,375 Pre-tax earnings 3,611 3,988 2,641 Income taxes 1,376 1,529 920 Net earnings $ 2,235 $ 2,459 $ 1,721 36 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) BNSF operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America with approximately 32,000 route miles of track (including 23,000 route miles owned) in 28 states and two Canadian provinces. BNSF’s major business groups are classified by product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. The discussion that follows compares BNSF’s results for the years ending December 31, 2010 and 2009. Revenues for the year ending December 31, 2010 were approximately $16.9 billion, representing an increase of approximately $2.8 billion (20%) over 2009. In 2010, revenues from each of the four business groups increased between 17% to 23% as compared to 2009. The increases reflected increased industrial products, agricultural products, consumer products and coal freight volume as well as overall increased yields. In addition, annual revenues in 2010 included an increase in fuel surcharges of $740 million versus 2009. Operating expenses in 2010 were $12.4 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion (15%) over 2009, reflecting an increase in costs to handle the increase in freight volume as well as higher fuel and wage costs. Fuel costs increased $644 million in 2010 primarily due to higher prices. Compensation and benefits expense increased $523 million in 2010 primarily due to increased incentive compensation, increased health and welfare expenses and general wage increases. Operating expenses in 2010 also reflected increased depreciation and amortization expense versus 2009. Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) Revenues and earnings of MidAmerican are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 PacifiCorp $ 4,518 $ 4,543 $ 4,558 $ 783 $ 788 $ 703 MidAmerican Energy Company 3,824 3,711 4,742 279 285 425 Natural gas pipelines 994 1,073 1,221 378 457 595 U.K. utilities 804 829 1,001 333 248 339 Real estate brokerage 1,046 1,071 1,147 42 43 (45 ) Other 119 216 1,302 47 25 1,278 $ 11,305 $ 11,443 $ 13,971 Earnings before corporate interest and taxes 1,862 1,846 3,295 Corporate interest (323 ) (318 ) (332 ) Interest on Berkshire junior debt (30 ) (58 ) (111 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (271 ) (313 ) (1,002 ) Net earnings $ 1,238 $ 1,157 $ 1,850 Earnings attributable to Berkshire * $ 1,131 $ 1,071 $ 1,704 Debt owed to others at December 31 19,646 19,579 19,145 Debt owed to Berkshire at December 31 165 353 1,087 * Net of noncontrolling interests and includes interest earned by Berkshire (net of related income taxes). We hold an 89.8% ownership interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (“MidAmerican”), which operates an international energy business. MidAmerican’s domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of two regulated utility companies and two interstate natural gas pipeline companies. In the United Kingdom, MidAmerican operates two electricity distribution businesses. The rates that our utilities and natural gas pipelines charge customers for energy and other services are generally subject to regulatory approval. Rates are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital. To the extent we are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, MidAmerican also operates a diversified portfolio of independent power projects and the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States. Our U.S. based regulated utilities businesses are conducted through PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”). PacifiCorp’s revenues and earnings before corporate interest and taxes (“EBIT”) in 2010 were $4,518 million and $783 million, respectively, relatively unchanged from 2009. Revenues in 2010 reflected lower average wholesale prices and a decrease in wholesale sales volume of approximately 8%, offset by higher retail prices approved by regulators and higher 37 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) (Continued) renewable energy credit sales. PacifiCorp’s EBIT reflected decreased prices of purchased electricity and natural gas and lower natural gas volumes, offset by higher transmission costs from higher contract rates, higher volumes of purchased electricity and higher coal prices. Revenues of MEC in 2010 increased $113 million (3%) over 2009, primarily due to higher volumes of regulated and non-regulated electricity sales which are attributable to higher customer usage, impacted by weather conditions and customer growth. MEC’s EBIT in 2010 was $279 million, a slight decrease compared to 2009, primarily due to higher energy costs, operating expenses and depreciation and amortization. Energy costs increased due to higher coal prices and greater thermal generation as a result of higher sales volume. Operating expenses increased due to higher maintenance costs from plant outages and storm damages. PacifiCorp’s revenues in 2009 of $4,543 million were relatively unchanged from 2008. Revenues in 2009 reflect an overall decrease in sales volume (both wholesale and retail) of approximately 2% and lower wholesale prices, somewhat offset by higher retail prices approved by regulators and higher renewable energy credit sales. PacifiCorp’s EBIT in 2009 of $788 million increased $85 million (12%) over 2008, primarily due to lower volume and prices of energy purchased in response to lower sales volumes and the use of lower-cost generation facilities put into service in the second half of 2008 and first quarter of 2009. Revenues of MEC in 2009 declined $1,031 million (22%) from 2008, primarily due to lower regulated natural gas and electricity sales. Regulated natural gas revenues decreased by $520 million in 2009, primarily due to a lower average per-unit cost of gas sold, which is passed on to customers and a 5% decline in sales volume. MEC’s regulated electricity revenues declined $315 million primarily as a result of a 35% decline in average wholesale prices and lower volumes, which were attributable to reduced demand due to economic conditions as well as mild temperatures in 2009. MEC’s EBIT in 2009 declined $140 million (33%) compared to 2008, primarily due to the lower regulated electricity revenues and increased depreciation due to additions of new wind-power generation facilities, partially offset by lower costs of purchased electricity and natural gas. Our natural gas pipeline businesses are conducted through Northern Natural Gas and Kern River. Natural gas pipelines revenues and EBIT each declined $79 million in 2010 from 2009. The declines were primarily due to lower transportation volume resulting from less favorable economic conditions and lower natural gas price spreads. Natural gas pipelines revenues and EBIT in 2009 declined $148 million and $138 million, respectively, from 2008 due primarily to lower volumes due to the economic climate, lower price spreads and the effects of a favorable rate proceeding included in the results for 2008. U.K. utility revenues decreased $25 million in 2010 from 2009 due to lower contracting revenue and lower gas production, partially offset by higher distribution revenue. The $85 million increase in EBIT is due to the sale of CE Gas (Australia) Limited during 2010 and an impairment of certain assets that was recorded during 2009. U.K. utility revenues in 2009 declined $172 million (17%) versus 2008, principally due to the impact from foreign currency exchange rates as a result of a stronger U.S. Dollar in 2009 as compared with 2008. EBIT of the U.K. utilities in 2009 declined $91 million (27%) compared to 2008. The decline in EBIT reflects foreign currency exchange rate changes as well as higher depreciation expense and charges to write down certain exploration and development assets. EBIT of the real estate brokerage business of $42 million in 2010 was relatively unchanged as compared to 2009. The real estate brokerage business incurred a loss of $45 million in 2008 that resulted from the weak U.S. housing markets. EBIT from other activities increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 due primarily to stock-based compensation expense of $125 million in 2009, as a result of MidAmerican’s purchase of common stock upon the exercise of the last remaining stock options that had been granted to certain members of management at the time of Berkshire’s acquisition of MidAmerican in 2000. EBIT from other activities in 2008 includes approximately $1.1 billion related to our investment in Constellation Energy and a related breakup fee we received from Constellation Energy. 38 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Marmon $ 5,967 $ 5,067 $ 5,529 $ 813 $ 686 $ 733 McLane Company 32,687 31,207 29,852 369 344 276 Other manufacturing 17,664 15,937 19,179 1,911 958 1,880 Other service 7,355 6,585 8,435 984 (91 ) 971 Retailing 2,937 2,869 3,104 197 161 163 $ 66,610 $ 61,665 $ 66,099 Pre-tax earnings $ 4,274 $ 2,058 $ 4,023 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,812 945 1,740 $ 2,462 $ 1,113 $ 2,283 Marmon We acquired a 60% controlling interest in Marmon Holdings, Inc. (“Marmon”) on March 18, 2008 and as of December 31, 2010 we owned approximately 64% of its outstanding common stock. In the first quarter of 2011, we will acquire additional shares and increase our ownership interest to about 80.2%. Marmon’s revenues, costs and expenses are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning as of the initial acquisition date in 2008. Through Marmon, we operate approximately 130 manufacturing and service businesses that operate independently within eleven diverse business sectors. Marmon’s revenues in 2010 were $5,967 million, an increase of approximately 18% over 2009. About 40% of the revenues increase was the result of increased copper prices, the cost of which is passed to customers with little or no margin. The balance of the revenues increase in 2010 was associated with a gradual rebound in other sectors as Marmon’s end markets improved from 2009’s low levels. Earnings in 2010 increased $127 million (19%) to $813 million in comparison with 2009. Revenues in 2010 increased in all sectors, except Transportation Services & Engineered Products and Water Treatment sectors. With the exception of Distribution Services, all sectors had improvement in earnings in 2010. Earnings as a percent of revenues were 13.6% in 2010 and 13.5% in 2009. Operating margins in 2010 were negatively impacted by the increase in copper prices. The Transportation Services & Engineered Products and Building Wire sectors had the largest increases in earnings in 2010 compared to 2009. Earnings in 2010 also benefitted from lower interest expense. Revenues in 2009 declined approximately 27% from 2008 (including periods in 2008 prior to our acquisition). The revenue decline in 2009 reflected the impact of the recession which led to lower customer demand across all sectors, and particularly in the Building Wire, Engineered Wire & Cable, Flow Products and Distribution Services sectors. Pre-tax earnings in 2009 declined approximately 26% from the full year of 2008 which reflects the decline in revenues, somewhat offset by a $160 million reduction in operating costs resulting from cost reduction efforts. In 2009, the Retail Store Fixtures, Food Service Equipment and Water Treatment sectors produced comparable or improved earnings with 2008 despite lower revenues. The remaining sectors experienced lower earnings in 2009 compared to 2008. McLane Company Through McLane, we operate a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. McLane’s business is marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins, and the fact that about 30% of its annual revenues are from sales to Wal-Mart. A curtailment of purchasing by Wal-Mart could have a material adverse impact on McLane’s earnings. In 2010, McLane acquired Empire Distributors, based in Georgia and North Carolina and Horizon Wine and Spirits Inc., based in Tennessee. Empire and Horizon are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer. McLane’s revenues in 2010 were approximately $32.7 billion, representing an increase of $1.5 billion (5%) over 2009 reflecting an 11% increase in foodservice revenues (driven by increased unit volume) and a relatively minor increase in grocery revenues. Pre-tax earnings in 2010 of $369 million increased $25 million (7%) over 2009. The increase in earnings in 2010 39 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) McLane Company (Continued) reflected the favorable impact of the Empire and Horizon acquisitions and increased foodservice earnings, partially offset by lower earnings from the grocery unit. Earnings in 2009 included the impact of a substantial inventory price change gain in the grocery unit associated with an increase in federal excise taxes on cigarettes. Many tobacco manufacturers raised prices in anticipation of the tax increase, which allowed McLane to generate a one-time price change gain. The combined gross margin rate in 2010 was 5.75% versus 5.72% in 2009. McLane continues to maintain tight control over operating expenses. Revenues were $31.2 billion in 2009, an increase of $1.4 billion (5%) compared to 2008. The increase in revenues in 2009 reflected an 8% increase in the grocery business, partially offset by an 11% decline from the foodservice business. The revenue increases in 2009 reflected additional grocery customers as well as manufacturer price increases and state excise tax increases. Pre-tax earnings in 2009 increased $68 million (25%) over 2008. Earnings in 2009 included the impact of the aforementioned inventory price change gain. The comparative increase in earnings in 2009 from the inventory price change gain was partially offset by a related one-time floor stock tax and by lower earnings from the foodservice business. Operating results in 2009 also benefited from lower fuel costs and operating expense control efforts. Other manufacturing Our other manufacturing businesses include a wide array of businesses. Included in this group are several manufacturers of building products (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville, Shaw and MiTek) and apparel (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes the Russell athletic apparel and sporting goods business and the Vanity Fair Brands women’s intimate apparel business). Among other businesses also included in this group are Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehicles, ISCAR Metalworking Companies (“IMC”), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide and CTB International (“CTB”), a manufacturer of equipment for the livestock and agricultural industry. Revenues from our other manufacturing activities in 2010 were $17.7 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion (11%) over 2009. The increase was primarily due to volume driven revenue increases of Forest River (57%), IMC (41%), CTB (20%) and Johns Manville (12%). These operations rebounded in 2010 from slow business activity in 2009. Despite the increase in revenues by Johns Manville, our building products operations continue to be adversely affected by the overall soft residential and commercial real estate conditions. Pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses in 2010 increased $953 million (99%) compared with earnings in 2009. The improvements in earnings in 2010 were driven by significant earnings increases at almost all of our manufacturing businesses, including our apparel and building products businesses. In particular, Fruit of the Loom’s operating results significantly improved primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and cost management efforts. Increased earnings at IMC and Forest River were primarily a result of the aforementioned revenue growth. Overall, our manufacturing businesses benefitted in 2010 from higher customer demand and the impact of their cost containment efforts over the past two years. Nearly all of the businesses in our manufacturing group experienced the adverse effects of the global economic recession in 2009 as consumers and customers cut purchases. Revenues in 2009 were $15.9 billion, a decrease of $3.2 billion (17%) from 2008. Revenues were lower for apparel (11%), building products (20%) and other businesses (16%) as compared to 2008. Pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses were $958 million in 2009, a decrease of $922 million (49%) versus 2008. The declines in earnings reflected the lower revenues as well as relatively higher costs resulting from lower manufacturing efficiencies. Other service Our other service businesses include NetJets, the world’s leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft, and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft. Among the other businesses also included in this group are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor; Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings; The Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools; International Dairy Queen, a licensor and service provider to about 6,000 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; The Buffalo News, a publisher of a daily and Sunday newspaper; and businesses that provide management and other services to insurance companies. 40 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Other service (Continued) In 2010, revenues of our other service businesses were $7.4 billion, an increase of $770 million (12%) compared to 2009. Pre-tax earnings in 2010 were $984 million compared to a loss of $91 million in 2009. The improved results were significantly driven by improved operating results of NetJets and TTI. In 2010, NetJets’ revenues increased 7% over 2009. The increase was due to higher worldwide flight revenue hours and increased pass through costs, partially offset by lower management fees due to fewer aircraft in the NetJets program. NetJets generated pre-tax earnings of $207 million in 2010 compared to a pre-tax loss of $711 million in 2009, which included $676 million of asset writedowns and other downsizing costs. The asset write downs were primarily related to excess aircraft that have been subsequently sold or are expected to be sold for cash consideration approximating their written down values. Such costs in 2010 were relatively minor. On January 1, 2010, we began charging NetJets a guarantee fee related to the level of its outstanding debt. The guarantee fee was $38 million in 2010. Had a similar fee been charged in 2009, NetJets’ pre-tax loss of $711 million would have increased by $69 million. The improvement in earnings was due to the increase in revenues and to an overall reduction in flight operations and administrative costs, partially offset by higher fuel costs. NetJets continues to own more aircraft than is required for present operations and we expect to continue to dispose of selected aircraft over time. NetJets’ operating cost structure has been reduced to better match customer demand and we believe that NetJets will continue to operate profitably in the future. In 2010, revenues of TTI increased by approximately 45% over 2009 which was driven by very strong worldwide demand. We primarily attribute the revenue increase to strong consumer demand for electronic products, as well as to manufacturers replenishing depleted raw material inventories. We believe that the current strong market conditions will slow to more normalized levels and as a result, we anticipate that revenues growth will slow significantly from the extraordinary rate experienced in 2010. As a result of the increase in revenues, pre-tax earnings of TTI were significantly higher in 2010 compared to 2009. Revenues in 2009 were $6.6 billion, a decrease of $1.9 billion (22%) compared to 2008. Substantially all of our service businesses generated lower revenues in 2009 as compared to 2008, particularly at NetJets and to a lesser degree at TTI. In 2009, NetJets’ revenues declined 32% versus 2008 due to a 77% decline in aircraft sales as well as lower flight operations revenues primarily due to a 19% decline in flight revenue hours. Revenues at TTI were 17% lower in 2009 compared to 2008 due to the economic recession. NetJets produced a pre-tax loss in 2009 of $711 million compared to pre-tax earnings of $213 million in 2008. The pre-tax loss at NetJets in 2009 included the aforementioned asset writedowns and other downsizing costs of $676 million compared to $54 million of such charges in 2008. Excluding the results of NetJets, our other service businesses produced pre-tax earnings of $620 million in 2009 compared to pre-tax earnings of $758 million in 2008. The negative impact of the global recession was evident at substantially all of our other service businesses. Retailing Our retailing operations consist of four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge) and See’s Candies. In 2010, revenues were $2.9 billion, an increase of 2% compared to 2009 and pre-tax earnings were $197 million, an increase of 22% compared to 2009. The increase in earnings in 2010 was due to the modest increase in sales and ongoing cost containment efforts. Retailing revenues in 2009 decreased 8% compared to 2008. Pre-tax earnings of $161 million in 2009 were relatively unchanged from 2008. Throughout 2008 as the impact of the economic recession in the U.S. worsened, consumer spending declined and these conditions continued in 2009. 41 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Finance and Financial Products A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Manufactured housing and finance $ 3,256 $ 3,257 $ 3,560 $ 176 $ 187 $ 206 Furniture/transportation equipment leasing 660 661 773 53 14 87 Other 348 383 440 460 452 478 $ 4,264 $ 4,301 $ 4,773 Pre-tax earnings 689 653 771 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 248 242 302 $ 441 $ 411 $ 469 Revenues in 2010 from our manufactured housing and finance business (Clayton Homes) of $3.3 billion were relatively unchanged from 2009. Sales of manufactured homes declined approximately $40 million in 2010 versus 2009, reflecting an increase in unit sales of approximately 6% which was more than offset by lower average selling prices primarily attributable to product mix. Unit sales in the first half of 2010 benefitted from the home buyer tax credit, which expired in the second quarter and as a result demand declined over the last half of the year. Interest and finance income increased in 2010 as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement, which required us to consolidate securitized loan portfolios we originated several years ago. The operating results of Clayton Homes have been negatively affected by the economic recession as well as the credit crisis. In addition, our manufactured housing programs have been at a competitive disadvantage compared to traditional single family housing markets, which have been receiving significant interest rate subsidies from the U.S. government through government agency insured mortgages. For the most part, these subsidies are not available to factory built homes. As a result, manufactured housing construction, sales and related lending activities have been negatively impacted. Nevertheless, Clayton Homes remains the largest manufactured housing business in the United States and we believe that it will continue to operate profitably, even under the current conditions. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes in 2010 decreased $11 million (6%) versus 2009. Operating results in 2010 were negatively impacted by reduced earnings from manufactured home sales, partially offset by increased financial services earnings. Installment loan balances were approximately $13.5 billion as of December 31, 2010 (including about $1.3 billion related to securitized loans consolidated in 2010) versus $12.3 billion as of December 31, 2009. Revenues in 2009 of Clayton Homes declined $303 million (9%) from 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a 16% decline in units sold, partially offset by higher average selling prices and a slight increase in installment loan interest and other investment income. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $187 million in 2009, a decline of $19 million (9%) from 2008. Pre-tax earnings in 2009 were negatively impacted by a $79 million increase in estimated loan loss provisions, partially offset by improved margins from manufactured home sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses arising from cost reduction efforts. Revenues from our furniture and transportation equipment leasing activities in 2010 were relatively unchanged from 2009. Pre-tax earnings in 2010 were $53 million, an increase of $39 million over 2009. The earnings increase in 2010 was primarily attributable to cost containment efforts as well as improved transportation equipment utilization. Revenues and pre-tax earnings from our furniture/transportation equipment leasing businesses in 2009 declined $112 million (14%) and $73 million (84%), respectively, compared to 2008. The declines primarily reflected lower rental income driven by relatively low utilization rates for over-the-road trailer and storage units, and lower furniture rentals. Significant cost components of this business are fixed (depreciation and facility expenses), so earnings declined disproportionately to revenues. Other finance business earnings include investment income generated on fixed maturity and equity investments, including portions of our investments in Goldman Sachs and Wrigley securities as well as revenues and earnings from other miscellaneous activities. In addition, other activities include earnings from internal interest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes on 42 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Finance and Financial Products (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation’s (“BHFC”) borrowings ($11.5 billion as of December 31, 2010), which are used in connection with Clayton Homes’ installment lending activities. A corresponding charge is reflected in the manufactured housing and finance earnings. Also included in other finance business activity is the guaranty fee of $38 million that was due from NetJets in 2010. As previously discussed, NetJets recorded a corresponding charge to its 2010 earnings. Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows. Amounts are in millions. 2010 2009 2008 Investment gains/losses Sales and other disposals of investments Insurance and other $ 3,032 $ 277 $ 912 Finance and financial products 9 110 6 Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments (1,973 ) (3,155 ) (1,813 ) Other 1,017 (69 ) 255 2,085 (2,837 ) (640 ) Derivative gains/losses Credit default contracts 250 789 (1,774 ) Equity index put option contracts 172 2,713 (5,028 ) Other derivative contracts (161 ) 122 (19 ) 261 3,624 (6,821 ) Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 2,346 787 (7,461 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 472 301 (2,816 ) Net gains/losses $ 1,874 $ 486 $ (4,645 ) Investment gains or losses are recognized upon the sales of investments or as otherwise required under GAAP. The timing of realized gains or losses from sales can have a material effect on periodic earnings. However, such gains or losses usually have little, if any, impact on total shareholders’ equity because most equity and fixed maturity investments are carried at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses included as components of accumulated other comprehensive income. In 2010, investment gains/losses on sales and other disposals of investments included a $1.3 billion gain with respect to the redemption of the Swiss Re 12% convertible capital instrument and other investment gains/losses included a one-time holding gain of $979 million in connection with our acquisition of BNSF (see Notes 2 and 5). The recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses results in reductions in the cost basis of the investments but not a reduction in fair value and the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment loss has little if any impact on our shareholders’ equity and book value per share. Although we have recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses in earnings in each of the past three years, we continue to hold positions in many of these securities. The recognition of such losses does not necessarily indicate that sales are imminent or planned and sales ultimately may not occur. Furthermore, the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is either permanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost by a substantial margin. We collectively consider several factors in determining other-than-temporary impairment losses including the current and expected long-term business prospects of the issuer, our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers and the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline. We further recognize that stock prices may remain below intrinsic value for a period of time that is deemed excessive. As a result, other-than-temporary impairment losses may be recorded in these instances, even though we may strongly believe that the stock price will recover to at least its original cost and we currently possess the ability and intent to hold the security until, at least, that time. Other-than-temporary impairment losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 included unrealized losses on individual equity securities of $938 million (determined on a specific identification basis). Such losses averaged about 20% of the original 43 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) cost of the impaired securities. In each case, the issuer has been profitable in recent periods and in some cases highly profitable. Although we expect that these businesses will continue to remain profitable and that the market prices for these securities will eventually exceed our original cost, we could not establish sufficient objective evidence as to the timing or amount of the future recovery in market prices. We also recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses of about $1.0 billion on certain debt instruments where, after evaluation, we concluded that we would likely not receive all contractual cash flows when due. Other-than-temporary impairment losses in 2009 predominantly relate to a loss with respect to our investment in ConocoPhillips common stock. The market price of ConocoPhillips shares declined sharply over the last half of 2008. In 2009, we sold over half of the ConocoPhillips position we held at the end of 2008. Sales in 2009 were in anticipation of other investment opportunities, to increase overall liquidity and to realize capital losses that were carried back to prior years for income tax purposes. We continue to hold over 29 million shares of ConocoPhillips and its market price as of December 31, 2010 was about 75% over its market price at the time we recorded the aforementioned other-than-temporary impairment loss. None of the subsequent recovery in the market price of ConocoPhillips currently held is reflected in our net earnings but it is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. Other-than-temporary impairment losses recorded in 2008 were primarily related to investments in twelve equity securities. The unrealized losses in these securities generally ranged from 40% to 90% of cost. After reviewing these investments, we concluded that there was considerable uncertainty in the business prospects of these companies and thus uncertainty on the recoverability of the cost of the security. Derivative gains/losses primarily represent the changes in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contracts. Changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of equity and credit markets. We have not actively traded into and out of credit default and equity index put option contracts. Under many of the contracts, no settlements will occur until the contract expiration dates, many years from now. We reported pre-tax gains on our credit default contracts of $250 million in 2010, $789 million in 2009 and pre-tax losses of $1.8 billion in 2008. These gains and losses reflect the changes in the fair values of these contracts. The fair values of our credit default contracts are impacted by changes in credit default spreads, which have been volatile from period to period. The gains in 2010 reflected the overall narrowing of credit default spreads for corporate issuers and were somewhat offset by losses due to the widening of spreads for municipalities, particularly in the fourth quarter. There were no credit loss events on our contracts in 2010. The gains and losses from our credit default contracts in 2009 and 2008 derived primarily from changes in the fair value of our liabilities due to a significant widening of credit default spreads of corporate issuers in 2008 and the narrowing of spreads for corporate issuers in 2009. There were several credit loss events in the second half of 2008 and the beginning of 2009, primarily related to contracts involving non-investment grade (or high-yield) corporate issuers and during 2009 we paid losses of about $1.9 billion. In 2010 and 2009, gains on equity index put option contracts were $172 million and $2.7 billion, respectively compared to losses of $5.0 billion in 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we settled certain equity index put option contracts early at the request of the counterparty. The net gain in 2010 arising from these settled contracts was $561 million, which is represented by the difference between the recorded fair values of the contracts at December 31, 2009 and the settlement payment amounts. Otherwise, we recognized pre-tax losses of $389 million under our remaining equity index put option contracts reflecting generally lower interest rate assumptions and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes. The derivative contract gains in 2009 reflected increases in the underlying equity indexes ranging from approximately 19% to 23%, partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar on non-U.S. contracts and lower interest rates. These factors combined to produce a decrease in our estimated liabilities. The losses in 2008 reflected declines of between 30% and 45% in underlying equity indexes. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our remaining equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates, which begin in 2018. Except for the early settlements referred to previously, there have been no other cash settlements related to these contracts. Financial Condition Our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2010 was $157.3 billion, an increase of $26.2 billion from December 31, 2009. The increase in our shareholders’ equity included approximately $10.6 billion related to the issuance of Berkshire common stock in connection with the BNSF acquisition. 44 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) Consolidated cash and investments of insurance and other businesses approximated $147.7 billion at December 31, 2010 including cash and cash equivalents of $34.8 billion. These assets are held predominantly in our insurance businesses. In February 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of BNSF common stock that we did not already own for aggregate consideration of approximately $26.5 billion. The consideration paid included $15.9 billion in cash consisting of $8.0 billion in proceeds from newly issued parent company debt (which included $2.0 billion that matured in February 2011) and $7.9 billion of cash on hand, plus Berkshire Class A and B common stock with an aggregate value of approximately $10.6 billion. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses conducted by MidAmerican and BNSF maintain very large investments in property, plant and equipment and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of MidAmerican in 2010 were approximately $2.6 billion. For the period between February 13, 2010 and December 31, 2010, BNSF’s capital expenditures were approximately $2.3 billion, including additions to other assets. MidAmerican’s forecasted capital expenditures for 2011 are approximately $3.1 billion. BNSF’s forecasted capital expenditures and commitments for 2011 are approximately $3.5 billion. Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded from cash flows from operations and debt proceeds. Aggregate borrowings of the railroad, utilities and energy businesses were about $31.6 billion as of December 31, 2010, including $12.0 billion of borrowings of BNSF. BNSF, MidAmerican, and their operating subsidiaries have debt and capital lease maturities in 2011 of approximately $2.2 billion. Berkshire has committed until February 28, 2011 to provide up to $3.5 billion of additional capital to MidAmerican to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund its regulated utility subsidiaries. In 2010, the commitment was amended to extend the term of the commitment to February 28, 2014 and to reduce the commitment to $2 billion beginning on March 1, 2011. Berkshire does not intend to guarantee the repayment of debt by BNSF, MidAmerican or any of their subsidiaries. Assets of the finance and financial products businesses, which consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, fixed maturity securities, other investments and cash and cash equivalents, were approximately $25.7 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $25.1 billion at December 31, 2009. Liabilities were approximately $24.0 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. As of December 31, 2010, notes payable and other borrowings of $14.5 billion included approximately $11.5 billion par amount of notes issued by BHFC. In 2010, BHFC issued at various dates, notes with aggregate par amounts of $1.5 billion and repaid maturing notes with aggregate par amounts of $2.0 billion. In January 2011, BHFC issued an additional $1.5 billion of notes and repaid $1.5 billion of maturing notes. BHFC notes are unsecured and mature at various dates from 2011 to 2040. The proceeds from the BHFC notes are used to finance originated and acquired loans of Clayton Homes. The full and timely payment of principal and interest on the BHFC notes is guaranteed by Berkshire. Other debt of our finance and financial products businesses increased in 2010 by approximately $1.2 billion to $2.9 billion primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2009-16 and ASU 2009-17, which eliminated the concept of qualifying special purpose entities (“QSPE’s”) and the exemption of QSPE’s from previous consolidation guidance and which amended the standards related to consolidation of variable interest entities. See Note 1(t) and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2008 and continuing into the first part of 2009, access to credit markets became limited as a consequence of a worldwide credit crisis. However, management believes that the credit crisis has abated and as a result, interest rates for investment grade issuers relative to government obligations have declined. Nevertheless, restricted access to credit markets at affordable rates in the future could have a significant negative impact on our operations, particularly the railroad, utilities and energy and the finance and financial products operations. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law financial regulatory reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Reform Act”). The Reform Act reshapes financial regulations in the United States by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and firms, and providing new enforcement powers to regulators. Virtually all major areas of the Reform Act will be subject to regulatory interpretation and implementation rules requiring rulemaking that may take several years to complete. We are party to several equity put option and credit default contracts as described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. With limited exception, these contracts contain no collateral posting requirements under any circumstances, including changes in either the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts or a downgrade in Berkshire’s credit ratings. Substantially all of these contracts were entered into prior to December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2010, the net liabilities recorded for such contracts were approximately $8.0 billion and our collateral posting requirements were $31 million. With respect to such collateral requirements, we receive the income attributable to such collateral or, in certain instances, interest credit from the counterparty. Although the ultimate outcome of the regulatory rulemaking proceedings described in the preceding paragraph cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the provisions of the Reform Act that concern collateral requirements apply to derivatives contracts that were entered into prior to the enactment of the Reform Act, as ours 45 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) were. As such, although the Reform Act may affect some of our business activities, it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, which are not currently reflected in the financial statements, such as minimum rentals under operating leases. Such obligations will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date. The timing and/or amount of the payments of other obligations are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The timing and amount of payments arising under property and casualty insurance and derivative contract obligations which are reported in other in the table below are contingent upon the outcome of claim settlement activities that will occur over many years. Obligations arising under life, annuity and health insurance benefits are estimated based on assumptions as to future premium payments, allowances, mortality, morbidity, expenses and policy lapse rates. The amounts presented in the following table are based on the liability estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010. Although certain insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and life, annuity and health benefits are ceded to and recoverable from others under reinsurance contracts, such recoverables are not reflected in the table below. A summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 follows. Amounts are in millions. Estimated payments due by period Total 2011 2012-2013 2014-2015 After 2015 Notes payable and other borrowings (1) $ 91,947 $ 10,689 $ 18,846 $ 10,191 $ 52,221 Operating leases 9,121 1,156 1,953 1,556 4,456 Purchase obligations 34,906 9,816 8,640 5,619 10,831 Losses and loss adjustment expenses (2) 62,344 13,540 14,097 7,917 26,790 Life, annuity and health insurance benefits (3) 12,849 1,266 (404 ) (404 ) 12,391 Other 21,257 2,874 3,301 1,516 13,566 Total $ 232,424 $ 39,341 $ 46,433 $ 26,395 $ 120,255 (1) Includes interest. (2) Before reserve discounts of $2,269 million. (3) Amounts represent estimated undiscounted benefit obligations net of estimated future premiums. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates are necessarily based on assumptions about numerous factors involving varying, and possibly significant, degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements, with the benefit of hindsight, will likely be adjusted in the future based on additional information made available and changes in other facts and circumstances. 46 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses A summary of our consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Except for certain workers’ compensation reserves, liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as “gross unpaid losses”) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value, regardless of the length of the claim-tail. Amounts are in millions. Gross unpaid losses Net unpaid losses * Dec. 31, 2010 Dec. 31, 2009 Dec. 31, 2010 Dec. 31, 2009 GEICO $ 9,376 $ 8,561 $ 8,928 $ 8,211 General Re 16,425 17,594 15,690 16,170 BHRG 29,124 28,109 24,422 23,150 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 5,150 5,152 4,802 4,774 Total $ 60,075 $ 59,416 $ 53,842 $ 52,305 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges on reinsurance assumed and before foreign currency translation effects. We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts with respect to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of loss payments is subject to a great degree of variability and is contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the determination of the ultimate amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used in establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses. Regardless of the techniques used, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amounts payable in the future. As a result, uncertainties are imbedded in and permeate the actuarial loss reserving techniques and processes used. As of any balance sheet date, not all claims that have occurred have been reported and not all reported claims have been settled. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include provisions for reported claims (referred to as “case reserves”) and for claims that have not been reported (referred to as incurred but not yet reported (“IBNR”) reserves). The time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement payment date is referred to as the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within a few years of occurrence. Casualty losses usually have very long claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations. The legal environment further contributes to extending claim-tails. Receivables are recorded with respect to losses ceded to other reinsurers and are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses. In addition to the factors cited above, reinsurance recoverables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders. We utilize loss reserving techniques that are believed to best fit the particular business. Additional information regarding reserving processes of our significant insurance businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows. GEICO GEICO’s gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves as of December 31, 2010 were $9.4 billion. Gross reserves included $6.8 billion of reported average, case and case development reserves and $2.6 billion of IBNR reserves. GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance which has a relatively short claim-tail. The key assumptions affecting the setting of our reserves include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”), which includes loss adjustment expenses. Our reserving methodologies produce reserve estimates based upon the individual claims (or a “ground-up” approach), which yields an aggregate estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Ranges of loss estimates are not determined in the aggregate. Our actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserves using recognized standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The significant reserve components (and percentage of gross reserves as of December 31, 2010) are: (1) average reserves (15%), (2) case and case development reserves (60%) and (3) IBNR reserves (25%). Each component of loss reserves 47 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. Such amounts are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, rated state, reporting date and occurrence date, among other factors. A brief discussion of each reserve component follows. We establish average reserve amounts for reported auto damage claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. The average reserves are intended to represent a reasonable estimate for incurred claims for which our claims adjusters have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that are paid within a relatively short time after being reported. Average reserve amounts are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened. Our claims adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as soon as the specific facts and merits of each claim can be evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised as more information becomes known. For most liability coverages, case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim-tail, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is established. Therefore, we establish additional case development reserve estimates, which are usually percentages of the case reserve. As of December 31, 2010, case development reserves averaged approximately 25% of total established case reserves. In general, case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves. Case development factors are reviewed and revised periodically. For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are subtracted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established through the collaborative effort of actuarial, claims and other management. For each significant coverage, we test the adequacy of the total loss reserves using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Loss reserve estimates recorded at the end of 2009 developed downward by $507 million when reevaluated through December 31, 2010, producing a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2010. These downward reserve developments represented approximately 3.6% of earned premiums in 2010 and approximately 5.9% of the prior year-end reserve amount. Reserving assumptions at December 31, 2010 were modified appropriately to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future reserve development will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated. Within the automobile line of business, reserves for liability coverages are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails. Approximately 90% of GEICO’s reserves as of December 31, 2010 were for automobile liability, of which bodily injury (“BI”) coverage accounted for approximately 55%. We believe it is reasonably possible that the average BI severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used. If actual BI severity changes one percentage point from what was used in establishing the reserves, our reserves would develop up or down by approximately $132 million resulting in a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to be different from expected would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. Our exposure at GEICO to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining reserves associated with such exposure are currently a relatively insignificant component of GEICO’s total reserves (approximately 2.1%) and there is minimal apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure. Related claim activity over the past year was insignificant. 48 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re and BHRG Property and casualty loss reserves of our General Re and BHRG underwriting units derive primarily from assumed reinsurance. Additional uncertainties are unique to loss reserving processes for reinsurance. The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which are affected by market conditions and practices) and other factors. Due to the lack of standardization of contract terms and conditions, the wide variability of coverage needs of individual clients and the tendency for those needs to change rapidly in response to market conditions, the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainties, in and of themselves, cannot be reliably measured. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative, per occurrence excess or retroactive contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract. This occurs when company personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. However, loss information from aggregate excess-of-loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Occasionally, loss information is reported in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is usually provided through periodic reports and may include the amount of ceded losses paid where reimbursement is sought as well as case loss reserve estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers. Each of our reinsurance businesses has established practices to identify and gather needed information from clients. These practices include, for example, comparison of expected premiums to reported premiums to help identify delinquent client reports and claim reviews to facilitate loss reporting and identify inaccurate or incomplete claim reporting. These practices are periodically evaluated and changed as conditions, risk factors and unanticipated areas of exposures are identified. The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is delayed in comparison with primary insurance. In some instances there are multiple reinsurers assuming and ceding parts of an underlying risk causing multiple contractual intermediaries between us and the primary insured. In these instances, the delays in reporting can be compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer varies depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms and other factors. Contracts covering casualty losses on a per occurrence excess basis may experience longer delays in reporting due to the length of the claim-tail as regards to the underlying claim. In addition, ceding companies may not report claims to the reinsurer until they believe it is reasonably possible that the reinsurer will be affected, usually determined as a function of its estimate of the claim amount as a percentage of the reinsurance contract retention. However, the timing of reporting large per occurrence excess property losses or property catastrophe losses may not vary significantly from primary insurance. Under contracts where periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies, such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals which in the U.S. range from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. Outside the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices vary. In certain countries clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. The different client reporting practices generally do not result in a significant increase in risk or uncertainty as the actuarial reserving methodologies are adjusted to compensate for the delays. Premium and loss data is provided to us through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data provided is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Reinsurance contracts generally allow us to have access to the cedant’s books and records with respect to the subject business and provide us the ability to conduct audits to determine the accuracy and completeness of information. Audits are conducted as we deem them appropriate. In the normal course of business, disputes with clients occasionally arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through the involvement of our claims department personnel and the appropriate client personnel or by independent outside counsel. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or alternative dispute resolution will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In summary, the scope, number and potential variability of assumptions required in estimating ultimate losses from reinsurance contracts are more uncertain than primary property and casualty insurance due to the factors previously discussed. 49 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re General Re’s gross and net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and gross reserves by major line of business as of December 31, 2010 are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Type Line of business Reported case reserves $ 8,516 Workers’ compensation (1) $ 3,049 IBNR reserves 7,909 Professional liability (2) 946 Gross reserves 16,425 Mass tort-asbestos/environmental 1,677 Ceded reserves and deferred charges (735 ) Auto liability 3,059 Net reserves $ 15,690 Other casualty (3) 2,482 Other general liability 2,651 Property 2,561 Total $ 16,425 (1) Net of discounts of $2,269 million. (2) Includes directors and officers and errors and omissions coverage. (3) Includes medical malpractice and umbrella coverage. The discussion that follows describes our process of establishing loss reserve estimates at General Re. Our loss reserve estimation process is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (“ACRs”) and IBNR reserves. Critical judgments in establishing loss reserves involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the expectation of ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and comparison of case reserve reporting trends to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded reserve amounts are subject to “tail risk” where reported losses develop beyond the maximum expected loss emergence pattern time period. We do not routinely determine loss reserve ranges because we believe that the techniques necessary to make such determinations have not sufficiently developed and that the myriad of assumptions required render such resulting ranges to be unreliable. In addition, counts of claims or average amounts per claim are not utilized because clients do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail. Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, our claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners’ estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners’ estimates are significantly greater than the ceding company’s estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACRs are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2010, ACRs aggregated approximately $2.7 billion before discounts and were concentrated in workers’ compensation reserves, and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. Our examiners also periodically conduct detailed claim reviews of individual clients and case reserves are often increased as a result. In 2010, we conducted 314 claim reviews. Our actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (“reserve cells”) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative and program) and line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, etc.). For each reserve cell, premiums and losses are aggregated by accident year, policy year or underwriting year (depending on client reporting practices) and analyzed over time. We internally refer to these loss aggregations as loss triangles, which serve as the primary basis for our IBNR reserve calculations. We review over 300 reserve cells for our North American business and approximately 900 reserve cells with respect to our international business. We use loss triangles to determine the expected case loss emergence patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, loss triangles are further used to determine IBNR reserves. While additional calculations form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern, the determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly a mechanical process. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, we use estimation formulas along with reliance on other loss triangles and judgment. Factors affecting our loss development triangles include but are not limited to the following: changes in client claims practices, changes in claim examiners’ use of ACRs or the frequency of client company claim reviews, changes in policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate 50 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. Collectively, these factors influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns. We select expected loss ratios by reserve cell, by accident year, based upon reviewing forecasted losses and indicated ultimate loss ratios that are predicted from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premium. If the selected emergence pattern is not accurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios may not be accurate, which can affect the selected loss ratios and hence the IBNR reserve. As with selected loss emergence patterns, selecting expected loss ratios is not a strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing loss ratios. We estimate IBNR reserves by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, our actuaries calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year. These calculations do not involve new assumptions and use the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year. In 2010, for prior years’ workers’ compensation losses, our reported claims were less than expected claims by $148 million. However, further analysis of the workers’ compensation reserve cells by segment indicated the need for additional IBNR. These developments precipitated $123 million of a net increase in nominal IBNR reserve estimates for unreported occurrences. After deducting $123 million for the change in net reserve discounts during the year, the net increase in workers’ compensation losses from prior years’ occurrences reduced pre-tax earnings in 2010 by $98 million. To illustrate the sensitivity of changes in expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios for our significant excess-of-loss workers’ compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves of approximately $723 million and $377 million on a discounted basis as of December 31, 2010. The increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates. Our other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) developed downwards in 2010 relative to expectations. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given year means that loss reserve amounts currently established will continue to develop favorably. For our significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells (including medical malpractice, umbrella, auto and general liability), an increase of five points in the tails of the expected emergence patterns and an increase of five percent in expected loss ratios (one percent for large international proportional reserve cells) would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $902 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $902 million. Our property losses were lower than expected in 2010 but the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses. In response to favorable claim developments and another year of information, estimated remaining World Trade Center losses were reduced by $17 million. In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (“D&O and E&O”) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected emergence patterns. These cells often involve a spike in loss activity arising from recent industry developments making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern. For our large D&O and E&O reserve cells an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern (for those cells where emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $190 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates. 51 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, “mass tort”) claims. Unpaid mass tort reserves at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $1.7 billion gross and $1.3 billion net of reinsurance. Mass tort net claims paid were about $89 million in 2010. In 2010, ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims were increased by $70 million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider “survival ratios” based on net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. The survival ratio based on claim payments made over the last three years was approximately 14 years as of December 31, 2010. The reinsurance industry’s comparable survival ratio for asbestos and pollution reserves was approximately 10 years. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. BHRG BHRG’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2010 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions. Property Casualty Total Reported case reserves $ 1,456 $ 2,791 $ 4,247 IBNR reserves 2,253 3,904 6,157 Retroactive — 18,720 18,720 Gross reserves $ 3,709 $ 25,415 29,124 Deferred charges and ceded reserves (4,702 ) Net reserves $ 24,422 In general, the methodologies we use to establish loss reserves vary widely and encompass many of the common methodologies employed in the actuarial field today. Certain traditional methodologies such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques are utilized as well as ground-up techniques where appropriate. Additional judgments must also be employed to consider changes in contract conditions and terms as well as the incidence of litigation or legal and regulatory change. As of December 31, 2010, our gross loss reserves related to retroactive reinsurance policies were predominately for casualty or liability losses. Our retroactive policies include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses (relating to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date) above a contractual retention are indemnified or contracts that indemnify all losses paid by the counterparty after the policy effective date. We paid retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses of approximately $1.8 billion in 2010. The classification “reported case reserves” has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since the amount is often derived from reports in bulk from ceding companies, who may have inconsistent definitions of “case reserves.” We review and establish loss reserve estimates, including estimates of IBNR reserves, in the aggregate by contract. In establishing retroactive reinsurance reserves, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. We assign judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, we reassess expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process. During 2010, retroactive reserves developed downward by $191 million. BHRG’s liabilities for environmental, asbestos and latent injury losses and loss adjustment expenses were approximately $10.7 billion at December 31, 2010 and $9.1 billion at December 31, 2009 and were concentrated within retroactive reinsurance 52 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG (Continued) contracts. We paid losses in 2010 attributable to these exposures of approximately $800 million. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not regularly receive reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies on a consistent basis, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, we conduct a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data of the reinsured to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, our estimates can only be developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. Potential legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on establishing loss reserves for mass tort claims in the future. The maximum losses payable under our retroactive policies is not expected to exceed approximately $32 billion as of December 31, 2010. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we currently believe it unlikely that gross unpaid losses as of December 31, 2010 ($18.7 billion) will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15%. A significant number of our reinsurance contracts are expected to have a low frequency of claim occurrence combined with a potential for high severity of claims. These include property losses from catastrophes, terrorism and aviation risks under catastrophe and individual risk contracts. Loss reserves related to catastrophe and individual risk contracts were approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of about $200 million from December 31, 2009. Loss reserves for prior years’ events declined by approximately $190 million in 2010, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Catastrophe loss reserves are provided when it is probable that an insured loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event. Other reinsurance reserve amounts are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on an individual contract basis, supplemented by management’s judgment of the impact on each contract of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon management’s judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding company’s loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared. Derivative contract liabilities Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant amounts of derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. Our significant derivative contract exposures are concentrated in credit default and equity index put option contracts. These contracts were primarily entered into in over-the-counter markets and certain elements in the terms and conditions of such contracts are not standardized and are highly illiquid. In particular, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. Furthermore, there is no source of independent data available to us showing trading volume and actual prices of completed transactions. As a result, the values of these liabilities are primarily based on valuation models, discounted cash flow models or other valuation techniques that are believed to be used by market participants. Such models or other valuation techniques may use inputs that are observable in the marketplace, while others are unobservable. Unobservable inputs require us to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in establishing prices. Considerable judgment may be required in making assumptions, including the selection of interest rates, default and recovery rates and volatility. Changes in assumptions may have a significant effect on values. For these reasons, we classify our credit default and equity index put option contracts using Level 3 measurements under GAAP. The fair values of our high yield credit default contracts are primarily based on indications of bid/ask pricing data. The bid/ask data represents non-binding indications of prices for which similar contracts would be exchanged. Pricing data for the high yield index contracts is obtained from one to three sources depending on the particular index. For the single name and municipal issuer credit default contracts, our fair values are generally based on credit default spread information obtained from a widely 53 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Derivative contract liabilities (Continued) used reporting source. We monitor and review pricing data for consistency as well as reasonableness with respect to current market conditions. We generally base estimated fair values on the ask prices (the average of such prices if more than one indication is obtained). We make no significant adjustments to the pricing data referred to above. Further, we make no significant adjustments to fair values for non-performance risk. We concluded that the values produced from this data (without adjustment) reasonably represented the values for which we could have transferred these liabilities. However, our contract terms (particularly the lack of collateral posting requirements) likely preclude any transfer of the contracts to third parties. Accordingly, prices in a current actual settlement or transfer could differ significantly from the fair values used in the financial statements. We do not operate as a derivatives dealer and currently we do not utilize offsetting strategies to hedge these contracts. We intend to allow our credit default contracts to run off to their respective expiration dates. We determine the estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts based on the widely used Black-Scholes option valuation model. Inputs to the model include the current index value, strike price, discount rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted average discount and dividend rates used as of December 31, 2010 were 3.7% and 2.9%, respectively, and were approximately 4.0% and 2.7%, respectively, as of December 31, 2009. The discount rates as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 were approximately 82 basis points and 55 basis points (on a weighted average basis), respectively, over benchmark interest rates and represented an estimate of the spread between our borrowing rates and the benchmark rates for comparable durations. The spread adjustments were based on spreads for our obligations and obligations for comparably rated issuers. We believe the most significant economic risks relate to changes in the index value component and to a lesser degree to the foreign currency component. For additional information, see our Market Risk Disclosures. The Black-Scholes model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. The weighted average volatility used as of December 31, 2010 was approximately 21.5%, which was relatively unchanged from year end 2009. The weighted average volatilities are based on the volatility input for each equity index put option contract weighted by the notional value of each equity index put option contract as compared to the aggregate notional value of all equity index put option contracts. The volatility input for each equity index put option contract is based upon the implied volatility at the inception of each equity index put option contract. The impact on fair value as of December 31, 2010 ($6.7 billion) from changes in volatility is summarized below. The values of contracts in an actual exchange are affected by market conditions and perceptions of the buyers and sellers. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model. Dollars are in millions. Hypothetical change in volatility (percentage points) Hypothetical fair value Increase 2 percentage points $ 7,221 Increase 4 percentage points 7,732 Decrease 2 percentage points 6,208 Decrease 4 percentage points 5,711 Other Critical Accounting Policies We record deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the difference between the consideration received and the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. Deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of loss payments. Adjustments to these assumptions are applied retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were approximately $3.8 billion at December 31, 2010. Significant changes in the estimated amount and payment timing of unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $49.0 billion, which includes $14.8 billion arising from our acquisition of BNSF in February 2010. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and conducted our most recent annual review in the fourth quarter of 2010. Such tests include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting unit’s fair value, 54 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Other Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may involve forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures as well as an appropriate discount rate. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual future results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then individual assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is then charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Interest Rate Risk We regularly invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur with respect to assets. We strive to maintain high credit ratings so that the cost of debt is minimized. We utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks on a limited basis. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate investments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate investments. 55 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Interest Rate Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that no other significant factors change that determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Equity Price Risk Historically, we have maintained large amounts of invested assets in exchange traded equity securities. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices and prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments may be concentrated in relatively few investees. At December 31, 2010, approximately 58% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated in four investees. We prefer to hold equity investments for very long periods of time so we are not troubled by short-term price volatility with respect to our investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. We strive to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short-term equity price volatility. Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate potential loss with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, the change in fair value resulting from current changes in the index values are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract. These contracts expire between 2018 and 2026 and may not be unilaterally settled before their respective expiration dates. 56 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Equity Price Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes our equity investments and derivative contract liabilities with equity price risk as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates is also shown. The selected 30% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

Excludes investments accounted for under the equity method. Foreign Currency Risk We generally do not use derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency price changes primarily because of the natural hedging that occurs between assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial statements of subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. Dollar as their functional currency are translated into U.S. Dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in earnings primarily as a result of the translation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities held by our U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, we hold investments in major multinational companies that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own, such as The Coca-Cola Company. Our net assets subject to translation are primarily in our insurance and utilities and energy businesses, and to a lesser extent in our manufacturing and services businesses. The translation impact is somewhat offset by transaction gains or losses on net reinsurance liabilities of certain U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies as well as the equity index put option liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries relating to contracts that would be settled in foreign currencies. Commodity Price Risk Through our ownership of MidAmerican, we are subject to commodity price risk. Exposures include variations in the price of fuel to generate electricity, wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold and natural gas supply for customers. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage and transmission and transportation constraints. To mitigate a portion of the risk, MidAmerican uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Accordingly, net unrealized gains and losses associated with interim price movements on such contracts are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Financial results would be negatively 57 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Commodity Price Risk (Continued) impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. MidAmerican also uses futures, options and swap agreements to economically hedge gas and electric commodity prices for physical delivery to non-regulated customers. MidAmerican does not engage in a material amount of proprietary trading activities. The table that follows summarizes our commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of MidAmerican as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of each date.

Forward-looking statements include statements that are predictive in nature, that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, that include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects, and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions about us, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guaranties of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane or an act of terrorism that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries, changes in insurance laws or regulations, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. 58 Table of Contents Item 7A.

Amounts are in millions. 2011 2010 2009 Insurance – underwriting $ 154 $ 1,301 $ 949 Insurance – investment income 3,555 3,860 4,271 Railroad 2,972 2,235 (1) — Utilities and energy 1,204 1,131 1,071 Manufacturing, service and retailing 3,039 (2) 2,462 1,113 Finance and financial products 516 441 411 Other (665 ) (337 ) (246 ) Investment and derivative gains/losses (521 ) 1,874 486 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire $ 10,254 $ 12,967 $ 8,055 (1) Includes earnings of BNSF from February 12. (2) Includes earnings of Lubrizol from September 16. Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. Our operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance efforts, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate “tone at the top” messages to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. The business segment data (Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. On February 12, 2010, BNSF became a wholly-owned subsidiary when we completed the acquisition of the 77.5% of BNSF common stock that we did not already own. As a result, beginning at that date, BNSF’s results and net earnings are included fully in our consolidated results. Prior to February 12, 2010, our share of BNSF’s net earnings determined under the equity method is reflected in the preceeding table as a component of insurance investment income. We completed the acquisition of The Lubrizol Corporation on September 16, 2011 and included its results as a component of manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in the table above. Insurance underwriting earnings in 2011 of $154 million included after-tax losses of approximately $1.7 billion from several significant catastrophe events occurring primarily in the first quarter. After-tax losses from catastrophes occurring in 2010 were approximately $600 million. Our railroad and utilities and energy businesses continued to generate significant earnings in 2011. Several of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses benefitted in 2011 from improved customer demand, which helped generate increased revenues and earnings. Our after-tax investment and derivative losses in 2011 were $521 million. In 2011, we incurred non-cash after-tax losses in connection with our equity index put option derivative contracts of $1.2 billion. In 2011, we also recognized after-tax investment gains of $1.2 billion from the redemptions of our Goldman Sachs and General Electric Preferred Stock investments and other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses of $590 million related to certain equity and fixed maturity securities. In 2010, after-tax investment and derivatives gains were $1,874 million, which included a one-time holding gain of $979 million related to our acquisition of BNSF, net realized gains from the dispositions of investments and net gains from derivative contracts, partially offset by OTTI losses recorded with respect to certain fixed maturity and equity securities. These gains and losses have caused and likely will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 30 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Through General Re and BHRG, we also reinsure life and health risks. Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing, with limited exceptions, is the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to BHRG and General Re. In 2011, we recorded aggregate pre-tax losses from catastrophe events of approximately $2.6 billion, arising primarily from the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, as well as weather related events in the Pacific Rim and the U.S. Our periodic underwriting results are often affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. In 2011, we reduced estimated liabilities related to certain retroactive reinsurance contracts which resulted in an increase in pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $875 million. These reductions were primarily due to lower than expected loss experience of one ceding company. Actual claim settlements and revised loss estimates will develop over time, which will likely differ from the liability estimates recorded as of year-end (approximately $64 billion). Accordingly, the unpaid loss estimates recorded as of December 31, 2011 may develop upward or downward in future periods with a corresponding decrease or increase, respectively, to pre-tax earnings. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities into U.S. Dollars as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In recent years, currency exchange rates have been volatile and the resulting impact on our underwriting earnings has been significant. A key marketing strategy followed by all of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $95 billion at December 31, 2011. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers. Underwriting results from our insurance businesses are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. 2011 2010 2009 Underwriting gain (loss) attributable to: GEICO $ 576 $ 1,117 $ 649 General Re 144 452 477 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (714 ) 176 250 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 242 268 84 Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 248 2,013 1,460 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 94 712 511 Net underwriting gain (loss) $ 154 $ 1,301 $ 949 31 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO Through GEICO, we primarily write private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO’s policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. This is a significant element in our strategy to be a low-cost auto insurer. In addition, we strive to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICO’s underwriting results are summarized below. Dollars are in millions. 2011 2010 2009 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 15,664 $ 14,494 $ 13,758 Premiums earned $ 15,363 100.0 $ 14,283 100.0 $ 13,576 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 12,013 78.2 10,631 74.4 10,457 77.0 Underwriting expenses 2,774 18.1 2,535 17.8 2,470 18.2 Total losses and expenses 14,787 96.3 13,166 92.2 12,927 95.2 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 576 $ 1,117 $ 649 Premiums earned in 2011 increased $1,080 million (7.6%) over 2010. Over the past year, voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 7.0%. The increase in policies-in-force in 2011 reflected an increase of 9.4% in voluntary auto new business sales. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2011 were approximately 709,000 greater than at December 31, 2010. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2011 increased $1,382 million (13.0%) over 2010. As a result, the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (“loss ratio”) increased from 74.4% in 2010 to 78.2% in 2011. The increase in the loss ratio in 2011 was primarily due to higher average injury and physical damage severities estimates and increased catastrophe losses incurred. In 2011, bodily injury severities estimates generally increased in the three to six percent range over 2010, while physical damage severities increased in the three to five percent range. In 2011, catastrophe losses were $252 million compared with $109 million in 2010. In 2011, underwriting expenses increased $239 million (9.4%) over 2010. The increase reflected additional advertising and increased payroll costs related to generating new business and servicing existing business. In 2012, we will adopt a new accounting standard that modifies the types of costs that may be deferred in acquiring or renewing insurance policies. We anticipate that the impact of adopting this new standard on the Berkshire insurance group will be concentrated in GEICO, which will cease deferring a significant portion of its direct advertising costs. If the new standard had been in effect as of December 31, 2011, we estimate that GEICO’s deferred costs as of that date would have been reduced by approximately $350 million with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings of approximately $230 million (represents the after-tax impact on earnings that accumulated over many years). Through the prospective adoption of the new standard, the deferred costs as of December 31, 2011 will be expensed over the remaining policy periods, which, for the most part, will occur over the first six months of 2012. New acquisition cost expenditures in 2012 will be deferred at a lower rate. As a result, underwriting expenses incurred during the first half of 2012 are expected to increase as a result of the new standard. Thereafter, the impact of the new standard on periodic underwriting results is expected to be relatively insignificant. Premiums earned in 2010 increased $707 million (5.2%) over 2009. The growth in premiums earned for voluntary auto was 5.3% in 2010, reflecting a 5.9% increase in policies-in-force over 2009. Premiums earned in 2010 also reflected a very slight increase in average premiums per policy over the year, although by the end of 2010 average premiums per policy declined to year-end 2009 levels. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2010 declined 2.6% from relatively high levels during 2009 when new business sales increased 9.0% versus 2008. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2010 were approximately 563,000 greater than at December 31, 2009. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2010 increased 1.7% over amounts incurred in 2009. The loss ratio was 74.4% in 2010 compared to 77.0% in 2009. The lower loss ratio in 2010 reflected the favorable impact of increased premium volume which was partially offset by changes in claims frequencies and severities. Claims frequencies in 2010 for property damage and collision coverages increased in the one to two percent range versus 2009, while frequencies for comprehensive coverages rose in the five to seven percent range from 2009 due to higher numbers of glass claims. Injury claims frequencies 32 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) increased in the two to four percent range versus 2009. Claim severities in 2010 for physical damage coverages rose in the two to four percent range compared to 2009, while injury severities increased in the three to seven percent range. Incurred losses from catastrophe events in 2010 were $109 million compared to $83 million in 2009. Underwriting expenses incurred in 2010 increased 2.6% versus 2009 and primarily reflected increased advertising costs. General Re Through General Re, we conduct a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. We write property and casualty reinsurance in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Germany-based General Reinsurance AG and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG. General Re strives to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines. Our management does not evaluate underwriting performance based upon market share and our underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Re’s underwriting results are summarized in the following table. Amounts are in millions. Premiums written Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Property/casualty $ 2,910 $ 2,923 $ 3,091 $ 2,941 $ 2,979 $ 3,203 $ 7 $ 289 $ 300 Life/health 2,909 2,709 2,630 2,875 2,714 2,626 137 163 177 $ 5,819 $ 5,632 $ 5,721 $ 5,816 $ 5,693 $ 5,829 $ 144 $ 452 $ 477 Property/casualty Premiums written in 2011 were relatively unchanged from 2010, while premiums earned in 2011 declined $38 million (1.3%) from 2010. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written and earned in 2011 declined $94 million (3.2%) and $132 million (4.4%), respectively, compared with 2010. The declines in premiums written and earned reflected lower premium volume in North American property treaty business, substantially offset by higher premiums in European property lines and broker market motor liability. Price competition in most property and casualty lines persists. Our underwriters continue to exercise discipline by not accepting offers to write business where prices are deemed inadequate. We remain prepared to increase premium volumes should market conditions improve. Underwriting gains were $7 million in 2011 and consisted of a net underwriting gain of $127 million from casualty/workers’ compensation business substantially offset by a net underwriting loss of $120 million from property business. Our property results in 2011 included $861 million of catastrophe losses for events occurring in 2011. The catastrophe losses in 2011 were primarily attributable to the earthquakes in New Zealand and Japan, as well as to weather related loss events in the United States, Europe and Australia. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual losses has produced and is expected to continue to produce significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. The underwriting gain in 2011 of $127 million from casualty/workers’ compensation business reflected overall reductions in prior years’ loss reserve estimates, due generally to lower than expected claim reports from cedants, which was partially offset by $111 million of recurring accretion of discounted workers’ compensation liabilities and amortization of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts written many years ago. Premiums written in 2010 declined $168 million (5.4%) from 2009, while premiums earned in 2010 declined $224 million (7.0%) from 2009. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written and earned in 2010 declined $202 million (6.5%) and $169 million (5.3%), respectively, compared with 2009. Premiums written and earned in 2010 reflected decreased volume due to price competition in most property and casualty lines. Underwriting gains were $289 million in 2010 and consisted of gains of $236 million from property business and $53 million from casualty/workers’ compensation business. The property results in 2010 included $339 million of catastrophe losses incurred primarily from the Chilean and New Zealand earthquakes and weather related losses in Europe, Australia and New England, offset by reductions in liability estimates for prior years’ losses. The underwriting gains of $53 million from casualty/workers’ compensation business reflected overall reductions in estimated prior years’ loss reserves, offset in part by $125 million of accretion of discounted workers’ compensation liabilities and amortization of deferred charges. 33 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) Underwriting results in 2009 included underwriting gains of $478 million from property business and losses of $178 million from casualty/workers’ compensation business. The net underwriting gain from property business was due to relatively lower losses occurring in 2009 and reductions in estimated liabilities for prior years’ losses. The underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business were primarily the result of establishing higher loss reserves for 2009 accident year occurrences to reflect higher loss trends as well as $118 million of accretion of discounted workers’ compensation liabilities and amortization of deferred charges, offset in part by overall reductions in estimated liabilities for losses occurring in prior years. Life/health Premiums earned in 2011 were $2,875 million, an increase of 5.9% over 2010, while premiums earned in 2010 increased 3.4% over 2009. Adjusting for the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums earned increased 2.2% over 2010, which increased 4.8% over 2009. The increases in premiums earned since 2009 were primarily due to higher volumes of international life business, which in 2011 represented about 60% of aggregate life/health premiums earned. The life/health operations produced net underwriting gains of $137 million in 2011, $163 million in 2010 and $177 million in 2009. Underwriting results for 2011 included losses of $15 million attributable to the earthquake in Japan. Underwriting results in each of the past three years were driven by generally lower than expected mortality in the life business. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group Through BHRG, we underwrite excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages on property and casualty risks for insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG’s business includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and excess primary and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual property risks referred to as individual risk. BHRG also writes retroactive reinsurance, which provides indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Other multi-line business refers to other property and casualty business written on both a quota-share and excess basis and includes a quota-share contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. (“Swiss Re”) covering a 20% share of substantially all of Swiss Re’s property/casualty risks incepting between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012. We currently do not anticipate that the Swiss Re quota-share contract will be renewed or extended. BHRG’s underwriting activities also include life reinsurance as well as a life annuity business. BHRG’s underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in millions. Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain/loss 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Catastrophe and individual risk $ 751 $ 623 $ 823 $ (321 ) $ 260 $ 782 Retroactive reinsurance 2,011 2,621 1,989 645 (90 ) (448 ) Other multi-line property/casualty 4,224 3,459 3,894 (338 ) 203 15 Life and annuity 2,161 2,373 — (700 ) (197 ) (99 ) $ 9,147 $ 9,076 $ 6,706 $ (714 ) $ 176 $ 250 Catastrophe and individual risk contracts may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification and cover catastrophe risks (such as hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters) or other property and liability risks. The timing and magnitude of losses produces extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results of this business. Catastrophe and individual risk premiums written were approximately $720 million in 2011, $584 million in 2010 and $725 million in 2009. The level of business written in a given period will vary significantly due to changes in market conditions and management’s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. We have constrained the volume of business written in recent years as premium rates have not been attractive enough to warrant significantly increasing volume. However, we have the capacity and desire to write substantially more business when appropriate pricing can be obtained. Premiums earned in 2011 from catastrophe and individual risk contracts increased 21% compared with 2010, which declined 24% from 2009. The increase in premiums written and earned in 2011 was primarily attributable to a few new contracts and to relatively higher premiums to reinstate coverage with respect to contracts that suffered catastrophe losses. Catastrophe and individual risk underwriting results in 2011 included estimated catastrophe losses of approximately $800 million attributable to the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand. Underwriting results from catastrophe and individual risk 34 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) business in 2010 included estimated losses of $322 million arising from several significant property catastrophe and casualty loss occurrences in 2010. Underwriting results in 2009 reflected no significant losses from catastrophes during the year. Changes in estimated losses attributable to prior years’ events were insignificant in 2011. In 2010 and 2009, underwriting results also included gains from the reductions of estimated unpaid losses for prior years’ loss events due to lower than expected reported claims. Retroactive reinsurance policies generally provide very large, but limited, indemnification of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events that are generally expected to be paid over long periods of time. Premiums earned under retroactive reinsurance contracts in 2011 included approximately $1.7 billion from a reinsurance contract with Eaglestone Reinsurance Company, a subsidiary of American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”). Under the contract, we agreed to reinsure the bulk of AIG’s U.S. asbestos liabilities. The agreement provides for a maximum limit of indemnification of $3.5 billion. Premiums earned in 2010 included approximately $2.25 billion from a contract with Continental Casualty Company, a subsidiary of CNA Financial Corporation, and several of its other insurance subsidiaries (collectively the “CNA Companies”). Under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, BHRG assumed certain asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities of the CNA Companies subject to an aggregate limit of indemnification of $4 billion. Premiums earned in 2009 included 2.0 billion Swiss Francs (“CHF”), or approximately $1.7 billion, from an adverse loss development contract with Swiss Re. The Swiss Re retroactive contract covers substantially all of Swiss Re’s non-life insurance losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses for loss events occurring prior to January 1, 2009, and is subject to a maximum limit of indemnification of CHF 5 billion. Underwriting results attributable to retroactive reinsurance include the recurring periodic amortization of deferred charges that are established with respect to these contracts. At the inception of a contract, deferred charges represent the difference between the premium received and the estimated ultimate losses payable. Deferred charges are subsequently amortized over the estimated claims payment period using the interest method and are based on estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments. The original estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments are analyzed against actual experience and if necessary are revised based on an actuarial evaluation of the expected remaining losses. Amortization charges and deferred charge adjustments resulting from changes to the estimated timing and amount of future loss payments are included as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, unamortized deferred charges for all of BHRG’s retroactive contracts were approximately $4.0 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. In 2011, the net underwriting gain from retroactive reinsurance contracts was $645 million, which reflected the favorable impact of a reduction in the estimated liability originally established under the Swiss Re contract of approximately $865 million, which was attributable to lower than expected loss experience. Gross unpaid losses from retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $18.8 billion at December 31, 2011 compared to approximately $18.7 billion and $18.0 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Premiums earned from other multi-line property and casualty business included $2.9 billion in 2011, $2.4 billion in 2010 and $2.8 billion in 2009 from the Swiss Re 20% quota-share contract. Underwriting results of our other multi-line property/casualty business can be significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In 2011, other multi-line property and casualty business included estimated catastrophe losses of approximately $933 million, which were primarily from the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand and from floods in Thailand. Underwriting results in 2010 included estimated catastrophe losses of approximately $308 million from the Chilean and New Zealand earthquakes, the Gulf of Mexico BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion and the Australian floods. The catastrophe losses in both years arose primarily under the Swiss Re quota-share contract. There were no significant catastrophe losses in 2009. Underwriting results in 2011 also included foreign currency transaction gains of $140 million arising from the conversion of certain reinsurance loss reserves and other liabilities that are payable in foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars. In 2010 and 2009, underwriting results included foreign currency transaction losses of approximately $168 million and $280 million, respectively. Substantially all of BHRG’s life and annuity premiums generated in 2011 and 2010 were from a life reinsurance contract entered into in January 2010 with Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc. (“SRLHA”) and a life reinsurance business acquired as of December 31, 2010 from Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (“SLACC”). We anticipate that the SRLHA contract and the business acquired from SLACC will generate substantial premiums earned and life benefits incurred in the future. 35 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) In the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded a pre-tax underwriting loss of $581 million ($642 million for the full year) with respect to the SRLHA contract. Since the inception of the SRLHA contract, mortality rates have continued to exceed the assumptions we made at the inception of the contract. During the fourth quarter of 2011, after considerable internal actuarial analysis, our management concluded that future mortality rates are expected to be greater than our original assumptions. As a result we increased our estimated liabilities for future policyholder benefits to reflect the new assumptions. The liabilities established in connection with the SRLHA contract reflect our best estimates for expected mortality, lapse rates, future premiums on the underlying policies and discount rates. We believe that our revised estimates for policyholder benefits are now adequate. However, under certain scenarios considered only remotely possible, additional increases in these liabilities and net underwriting losses of up to $300 million may occur. We do not currently believe significant additional net underwriting losses under this contract are likely. The underwriting results of the life and annuity business also include a portfolio of annuity contracts, most of which were written several years ago. These contracts generated underwriting losses of $118 million, $114 million, and $99 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, primarily related to periodic interest that accretes with respect to the related liabilities. At December 31, 2011, annuity liabilities were approximately $2.1 billion. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group Our primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses that principally write liability coverages for commercial accounts. These businesses include: Medical Protective Corporation (“MedPro”) and Princeton Insurance Company (acquired as of December 30, 2011), providers of professional liability insurance to physicians, dentists and other healthcare providers; National Indemnity Company’s primary group (“NICO Primary Group”), writers of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as “Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies,” providers of standard commercial multi-line insurance; Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers’ compensation solutions; and BoatU.S., a writer of insurance for owners of boats and small watercraft. Earned premiums by our primary insurance businesses were approximately $1.7 billion in each of the last three years. In recent years, premium volume of our primary insurers, in general, has been constrained by soft market conditions. We have the capacity and desire to write substantially more volume if market conditions improve. Underwriting gains as percentages of premiums earned were 14% in 2011, 16% in 2010 and 5% in 2009. The underwriting gain in 2011 reflects favorable loss experience at MedPro and Applied Underwriters, including overall reductions of estimated liabilities for prior years’ losses, partially offset by increased underwriting losses of the Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies. The improvement in underwriting results in 2010 was primarily due to reductions of MedPro’s estimated prior years’ loss reserves and reduced underwriting loss ratios of the Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income of our insurance operations follows. Amounts are in millions. 2011 2010 2009 Investment income before taxes, noncontrolling interests and equity method earnings $ 4,725 $ 5,145 $ 5,459 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,170 1,335 1,615 Net investment income before equity method earnings 3,555 3,810 3,844 Equity method earnings — 50 427 Net investment income $ 3,555 $ 3,860 $ 4,271 Investment income consists of interest and dividends earned on cash equivalents and investments of our insurance businesses. Pre-tax investment income in 2011 declined $420 million (8%) compared to 2010. Investment income in 2011 was negatively impacted by redemptions at the end of 2010 and in 2011 of certain investments we made in 2008 and 2009, 36 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) including: (1) the Swiss Re 12% capital instrument (CHF 3 billion); (2) the Goldman Sachs 10% Preferred Stock ($4.36 billion of the $5 billion aggregate Preferred Stock was held by insurance subsidiaries); and (3) the General Electric 10% Preferred Stock ($3 billion). Our insurance subsidiaries earned dividends from these three investments of $420 million in 2011 compared with approximately $1.0 billion in both 2010 and 2009. Our investment income in the future will be negatively affected by these redemptions, given the comparatively lower yields currently available from new investment opportunities. In 2011, investment income was favorably impacted by increased dividend rates with respect to several of our common stock holdings. Pre-tax investment income in 2010 declined $314 million (5.8%) compared with 2009. The decline in 2010 investment income reflected lower dividends earned from our investments in Wells Fargo common stock and the impact of a realized gain in 2009 of approximately $100 million from a short-term currency transaction made in anticipation of our investment in the Swiss Re capital instrument. Investment income in 2010 and 2009 included earnings from equity method investments. As a result of a reduction in our ownership of Moody’s in July of 2009, we discontinued the use of the equity method as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2009. As a result of our acquisition of the remaining outstanding stock of BNSF on February 12, 2010, we discontinued the use of the equity method and since that date, BNSF’s accounts have been consolidated in our financial statements. Dividends received on equity method investments are not reflected in our earnings. Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $70 billion at December 31, 2011, $66 billion at December 31, 2010 and $63 billion at December 31, 2009. The cost of float, as represented by the ratio of underwriting gain or loss to average float, was negative for the last three years, as our insurance business generated underwriting gains in each year. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 follows. Other investments include investments in Wrigley, Goldman Sachs, General Electric, Dow Chemical and Bank of America (See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Amounts are in millions.

BNSF’s revenues and operating results are included in our consolidated results beginning immediately after the acquisition. Prior to that date, we accounted for our investment in BNSF pursuant to the equity method. Our share of BNSF’s earnings for that period is included in net investment income of our insurance group. Earnings of BNSF are summarized below (in millions). BNSF’s earnings for the years ending December 31, 2010 and 2009 are provided for comparison, although these results are not fully reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 2011 Feb. 13, 2010 –Dec. 31, 2010 2010 2009 Revenues $ 19,548 $ 15,059 $ 16,850 $ 14,016 Operating expenses 14,247 11,013 12,355 10,762 Interest expense 560 435 507 613 14,807 11,448 12,862 11,375 Pre-tax earnings 4,741 3,611 3,988 2,641 Income taxes 1,769 1,376 1,529 920 Net earnings $ 2,972 $ 2,235 $ 2,459 $ 1,721 BNSF operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America with approximately 32,000 route miles of track in 28 states and two Canadian provinces. BNSF’s major business groups are classified by product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. The following discussion compares BNSF’s results for the years ending December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Revenues for the year ending December 31, 2011 were approximately $19.5 billion, representing an increase of approximately $2.7 billion (16%) over 2010. Revenues from each of the four business groups increased between 8% and 19% as compared to 2010. Overall, the increases in revenues in 2011 reflected a 12% increase in average revenues per car/unit across all four business groups, as well as a 3% increase in the volume of cars/units handled. Revenues in each period include fuel surcharges to customers under programs intended to recover incremental fuel costs when fuel prices exceed threshold fuel prices. Average revenues per car/unit in 2011 included the effects of fuel surcharge increases of 35% in 2011 as compared to 2010. The 3% increase in volume is comprised of increases of 7% in cars/units handled in the consumer products and industrial products groups combined with a 4% decrease in volume for coal products. The consumer products volume increase was attributable primarily to higher domestic intermodal and international volume. The decline in coal unit volume was partially attributable to the impacts of severe flooding along key coal routes. Industrial products volume increased primarily as a result of increased steel and sand shipments, as well as increased demand in petroleum products. Agricultural product volume remained relatively unchanged, as higher wheat exports and U.S. corn shipments were mostly offset by declining soybean exports. Operating expenses in 2011 were $14.2 billion, representing an increase of $1.9 billion (15%) over 2010. Fuel expenses increased $1.3 billion in 2011 primarily due to higher fuel prices. The remainder of the increase in fuel costs was driven by higher overall freight volumes and severe weather conditions, which negatively impacted efficiency. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $311 million, reflecting volume-related costs, as well as salaries and benefits inflation, increased personnel training costs and flood-related costs. Purchased services expenses increased $49 million due primarily to volume-related and flood-related costs, offset by lower locomotive maintenance costs. In 2010, purchased services also included one-time merger-related legal and consulting fees. Materials and other expenses increased $186 million, reflecting higher locomotive and freight car material costs and increased crew transportation, travel and casualty costs offset by lower environmental costs. Revenues for the year ending December 31, 2010 were approximately $16.9 billion, representing an increase of approximately $2.8 billion (20%) over 2009. Revenues from each of the four business groups increased between 17% and 23% as compared to 2009. The increases reflected increased volume as well as overall increased yields. In addition, annual revenues in 2010 included an increase in fuel surcharges of $740 million as compared to 2009. Operating expenses in 2010 were $12.4 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion (15%) over 2009, reflecting an increase in costs to handle the increase in freight volume as well as higher fuel and wage costs. Fuel costs increased $644 million primarily due to higher prices. Compensation and benefits expense increased $523 million in 2010 primarily due to increased incentive compensation, increased health and welfare expenses and general wage increases. Operating expenses in 2010 also reflected increased depreciation and amortization expense versus 2009. 38 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) We hold an 89.8% ownership interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (“MidAmerican”), which operates an international energy business. MidAmerican’s domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of two regulated utility companies, PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”). MidAmerican also operates two interstate natural gas pipeline companies. In the United Kingdom, MidAmerican operates two electricity distribution businesses, operating as Northern Powergrid Holdings Company (“Northern Powergrid”). The rates that utility and natural gas pipeline companies charge customers for energy and other services are generally subject to regulatory approval. Rates are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital. To the extent these operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, MidAmerican also operates a diversified portfolio of independent power projects and the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States. Revenues and earnings of MidAmerican are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 PacifiCorp $ 4,639 $ 4,518 $ 4,543 $ 771 $ 783 $ 788 MidAmerican Energy Company 3,530 3,824 3,711 279 279 285 Natural gas pipelines 993 994 1,073 388 378 457 Northern Powergrid 1,016 804 829 469 333 248 Real estate brokerage 1,007 1,046 1,071 39 42 43 Other 106 119 216 36 47 25 $ 11,291 $ 11,305 $ 11,443 Earnings before corporate interest and income taxes 1,982 1,862 1,846 Corporate interest (323 ) (323 ) (318 ) Interest on Berkshire junior debt (13 ) (30 ) (58 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (315 ) (271 ) (313 ) Net earnings $ 1,331 $ 1,238 $ 1,157 Earnings attributable to Berkshire * $ 1,204 $ 1,131 $ 1,071 Debt owed to others at December 31 19,915 19,646 19,579 Debt owed to Berkshire at December 31 22 165 353 * Net of noncontrolling interests and includes interest earned by Berkshire (net of related income taxes). PacifiCorp’s revenues in 2011 were $4,639 million, an increase of $121 million (3%) over 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $350 million in retail operating revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $196 million in wholesale and other operating revenue. The increase in retail revenue was due to higher prices approved by regulators and higher customer load. The decrease in wholesale and other revenue was due to a 24% decrease in average prices and a 6% decrease in volumes. Additionally, wholesale and other revenue decreased $57 million due to lower sales and higher deferrals of renewable energy credits. PacifiCorp’s earnings before corporate interest and taxes (“EBIT”) in 2011 were $771 million, a decrease of $12 million (2%) from 2010. Increased revenues were more than offset by an overall increase in energy and operating costs, as well as higher net interest expense. PacifiCorp’s revenues and EBIT in 2010 were $4,518 million and $783 million, respectively, relatively unchanged from 2009. Revenues in 2010 reflected lower average wholesale prices and a decrease in wholesale sales volume of approximately 8%, offset by higher retail prices approved by regulators and higher renewable energy credit sales. PacifiCorp’s EBIT reflected decreased prices of purchased electricity and natural gas and lower natural gas volumes, offset by higher transmission costs from higher contract rates, higher volumes of purchased electricity and higher coal prices. MEC’s revenues of $3,530 million in 2011 declined $294 million (8%) from 2010 due to lower regulated electric and gas revenues as well as lower nonregulated and other operating revenues. Regulated retail and wholesale electric revenues declined $117 million (7%), primarily due to a 19% reduction in wholesale volume and due to lower average wholesale prices. Regulated natural gas revenues declined $83 million (10%), primarily due to a 30% decline in wholesale volume. Nonregulated and other operating revenues decreased $112 million (9%), due principally to lower electricity volumes and prices. MEC’s EBIT of $279 million in 2011 was unchanged from 2010. The effect of the declines in revenues were essentially offset by lower energy costs, which was driven by lower sales volumes, and to a lesser degree, by lower net interest expense. 39 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) (Continued) Revenues of MEC in 2010 increased $113 million (3%) over 2009, primarily due to higher volumes of regulated and non-regulated electricity sales which are attributable to higher customer usage, impacted by weather conditions and customer growth. EBIT was $279 million in 2010, a slight decrease compared to 2009, primarily due to higher energy costs and operating expenses. Energy costs increased due to higher coal prices and greater thermal generation as a result of higher sales volume. Operating expenses increased due to higher maintenance costs from plant outages and storm damages. Natural gas pipelines revenues and EBIT in 2011 were relatively unchanged from 2010. Natural gas pipelines revenues and EBIT each declined $79 million in 2010 from 2009, which was primarily due to lower transportation volume resulting from less favorable economic conditions and lower natural gas price spreads. Revenues of Northern Powergrid were $1,016 million in 2011, an increase of $212 million (26%) from 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $197 million in distribution revenue, and to a lesser degree to a weaker U.S. Dollar. EBIT in 2011 was $469 million, an increase of $136 million (41%) over 2010. The increase was also primarily due to higher distribution revenues and the weaker U.S. Dollar. In addition, EBIT in 2010 included a $45 million gain on the sale of a subsidiary. Revenues decreased $25 million in 2010 from 2009 due to lower contracting revenue and lower gas production, partially offset by higher distribution revenue. The increase in EBIT of $85 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to the aforementioned subsidiary sale during 2010 and an impairment charged recorded during 2009. Revenues of the real estate brokerage business were $1,007 million in 2011, down 4% from $1,046 million in 2010, primarily due to a 4% decrease in average home sale prices. EBIT of the real estate brokerage business of $39 million was 7% lower than the $42 million in 2010 which was relatively unchanged as compared to 2009. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Marmon $ 6,925 $ 5,967 $ 5,067 $ 992 $ 813 $ 686 McLane Company 33,279 32,687 31,207 370 369 344 Other manufacturing 21,191 17,664 15,937 2,397 1,911 958 Other service 7,934 7,355 6,585 1,039 984 (91 ) Retailing 3,077 2,937 2,869 239 197 161 $ 72,406 $ 66,610 $ 61,665 Pre-tax earnings $ 5,037 $ 4,274 $ 2,058 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,998 1,812 945 $ 3,039 $ 2,462 $ 1,113 Marmon Through Marmon, we operate approximately 140 manufacturing and service businesses that operate independently within eleven diverse business sectors. Revenues in 2011 were $6.9 billion, an increase of approximately 16% over 2010. An estimated 25% of the aggregate revenue increase was attributed to increased copper prices affecting the Building Wire and Flow Products sectors, where copper cost increases are passed on to customers with little or no additional margin. Ten of the eleven business sectors produced comparative revenue increases. The only sector reporting a comparative revenue decrease was the Retail Store Fixtures sector, where its largest customer significantly reduced its purchases. Pre-tax earnings in 2011 were $992 million, an increase of approximately 22% over 2010. Pre-tax earnings as a percent of revenues was 14.3% in 2011 as compared to 13.6% in 2010. Pre-tax earnings to revenues percentages were negatively impacted by the increases in copper prices in both 2011 and 2010. Ten of the eleven sectors produced increased pre-tax earnings in 2011 compared to 2010. The Retail Store Fixtures sector reported lower pre-tax earnings consistent with the revenue decline. The improvements in revenues and pre-tax earnings generally reflected continued recoveries in many of Marmon’s end markets, increased product innovation and Marmon’s ongoing effort to control overhead costs. 40 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Marmon (Continued) Marmon’s revenues in 2010 were $6.0 billion, an increase of approximately 18% over 2009. About 40% of the aggregate revenue increase was the result of increased copper prices in the Building Wire and Flow Products sectors. The balance of the revenue increase in 2010 was associated with a gradual rebound in the other sectors, as Marmon’s end markets improved from the low levels in 2009. Pre-tax earnings in 2010 of $813 million increased 19% over 2009. With the exception of Distribution Services, all sectors had improvements in pre-tax earnings in 2010. Pre-tax earnings as a percent of revenues were 13.6% in 2010 and 13.5% in 2009. The pre-tax earnings to revenues percentage in 2010 was negatively impacted by the increase in copper prices, as the increased cost is passed on to customers with little or no additional margin. The Transportation Services & Engineered Products and the Building Wire sectors had the largest dollar increases in pre-tax earnings in 2010 compared to 2009. McLane Company Through McLane, we operate a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. McLane’s business is marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins. McLane’s significant customers include Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven and Yum! Brands. Approximately 30% of McLane’s annual revenues are attributable to Wal-Mart. A curtailment of purchasing by Wal-Mart or another of its significant customers could have a material adverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. In 2010, McLane acquired Empire Distributors, based in Georgia and North Carolina, and Horizon Wine and Spirits Inc., based in Tennessee. Empire and Horizon are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer. McLane’s revenues of $33.3 billion in 2011 increased approximately $600 million (2%) over 2010. The increase in revenues in 2011 was partially attributable to the inclusion of the full-year results of Empire and Horizon. Otherwise, revenues in 2011 from the grocery business were relatively unchanged from 2010, while revenues from the foodservice business increased approximately 7% over 2010. Pre-tax earnings in 2011 were essentially unchanged from 2010 which reflected the inclusion of Empire and Horizon and increased earnings from the grocery business, offset by lower earnings from the foodservice business. In 2011, McLane benefitted from a slight increase in its consolidated gross sales margin, which was offset by increased fuel, trucking and legal and professional costs. McLane’s revenues in 2010 were $32.7 billion, representing an increase of $1.5 billion (5%) over 2009 reflecting an 11% increase in foodservice revenues (driven by increased unit volume) and a relatively minor increase in grocery revenues. Pre-tax earnings in 2010 of $369 million increased $25 million (7%) over 2009. The increase in earnings in 2010 reflected the favorable impact of the Empire acquisition and increased foodservice earnings, partially offset by lower earnings from the grocery division. The combined gross margin rate in 2010 was 5.75% versus 5.72% in 2009. Earnings in 2009 included the impact of a substantial inventory price change gain in the grocery division associated with an increase in federal excise taxes on cigarettes. Many tobacco manufacturers raised prices in anticipation of the tax increase, which allowed McLane to generate a one-time price change gain. Other manufacturing Our other manufacturing businesses include several manufacturers of building products (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville, Shaw and MiTek) and apparel (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes the Russell athletic apparel and sporting goods business and the Vanity Fair Brands women’s intimate apparel business). Also included in this group are Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehicles, IMC Metalworking Companies (“Iscar”), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide and CTB, a manufacturer of equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries. Other manufacturing businesses also include The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”), a specialty chemical manufacturer, beginning as of September 16, 2011. In 2011, our other manufacturing businesses generally experienced increased levels of business and improved operating results, although the rates of improvement have been uneven. Other manufacturing revenues increased $3.5 billion (20%) in 2011 to $21.2 billion compared with 2010. In 2011, Lubrizol accounted for approximately $1.7 billion of the increase. Otherwise, revenues of our other manufacturing group increased 10%. Iscar and CTB in particular experienced strong demand for their products. Pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses were $2.4 billion in 2011, an increase of $486 million (25%) over 2010. Excluding the impact of Lubrizol, earnings increased 10% compared to 2010. Increased earnings were generated by Iscar 41 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Other manufacturing (Continued) and CTB, which were partially offset by lower earnings of the apparel group and, particularly from the Fruit of the Loom group of businesses, which were negatively impacted by significantly higher cotton costs. Our building products businesses continue to be negatively impacted by slow residential housing construction activity. Overall, our manufacturing businesses benefitted in 2011 and 2010 from higher customer demand and ongoing cost containment efforts. Revenues from our other manufacturing activities were $17.7 billion in 2010, an increase of $1.7 billion (11%) over 2009. The increase was primarily due to volume driven increases of Forest River, Iscar, CTB and Johns Manville. These operations rebounded in 2010 from slow business activity in 2009. Pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses were $1.9 billion in 2010, an increase of $953 million (99%) compared with earnings in 2009. The improvements in earnings were driven by significant earnings increases at almost all of our manufacturing businesses, including our apparel and building products businesses. Other service Our other service businesses include NetJets, the world’s leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft. Among the other businesses included in this group are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor; Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings; Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools; Dairy Queen, which licenses and services a system of over 6,100 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; Buffalo News, a publisher of a daily and Sunday newspaper; and businesses that provide management and other services to insurance companies. At the end of 2011, we acquired the Omaha World-Herald Company, a publisher of daily and weekly newpapers in Nebraska and Iowa. Revenues of our other service businesses were approximately $7.9 billion in 2011, an increase of $579 million (8%) over 2010. The revenue increase was primarily attributable to stronger demand for electronic components (TTI) and pilot training (FlightSafety) and from higher revenues at NetJets. TTI revenues increased 12% as revenues increased rapidly during the first half of 2011, and then moderated over the second half. FlightSafety’s revenues increased approximately 8% due primarily to increases in training demand within the business aviation and regional airline markets, partially offset by lower revenues from government customers. The comparative revenue increases of NetJets reflected revenues related to aircraft operating cost increases that are passed through to customers (with little or no margin), and slight increases in rates. Revenue hours flown in 2011 were essentially unchanged from 2010. Pre-tax earnings were $1,039 million in 2011, which exceeded 2010 by $55 million (6%). The increase in earnings was driven by higher earnings of FlightSafety, NetJets and TTI, partially offset by lower earnings from Pampered Chef and Buffalo News. FlightSafety’s earnings increased approximately 16%, reflecting the increased revenues and ongoing cost containment efforts. NetJets’ earnings increased 10% and was primarily attributable to higher revenues and lower aircraft maintenance costs due to a 10% reduction in the size of the fleet, partially offset by comparatively higher impairment charges related to the planned disposition of certain aircraft and fees incurred to cancel certain aircraft purchase commitments. Since the end of 2008, NetJets has reduced the number of aircraft in its fleet by approximately 20% and lowered its operating cost structure to better match customer demand, which we believe will help NetJets continue to operate profitably in the future. In 2010, revenues of our other service businesses were $7.4 billion, an increase of $770 million (12%) compared to 2009. Pre-tax earnings in 2010 were $984 million compared to a loss of $91 million in 2009. The improved results were significantly driven by improved operating results of NetJets and TTI. NetJets generated pre-tax earnings of $207 million in 2010 compared to a pre-tax loss of $711 million in 2009, which included $676 million of asset writedowns and other downsizing costs. The asset writedowns were primarily related to excess aircraft that have been subsequently sold or are expected to be sold for cash consideration approximating their written down values. Such costs were relatively minor in 2010. Revenues of TTI increased by approximately 45% which was driven by very strong worldwide demand. As a result of the increase in revenues, pre-tax earnings of TTI were significantly higher. Retailing Our retailing operations consist of four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge) and See’s Candies. Revenues of these businesses 42 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) were $3.1 billion in 2011, an increase of $140 million over 2010. Pre-tax earnings were $239 million, an increase of $42 million over 2010. Each of our retailing businesses generated comparatively higher revenues and pre-tax earnings. In 2010, revenues were $2.9 billion, an increase of 2% compared to 2009 and pre-tax earnings were $197 million, an increase of 22% compared to 2009. The increase in earnings in 2010 was due to the modest increase in sales and ongoing cost containment efforts. Finance and Financial Products Our finance and financial products businesses include manufactured housing and finance (“Clayton Homes”), transportation equipment leasing (“XTRA”), furniture leasing (“CORT”) as well as various miscellaneous financing activities. A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Manufactured housing and finance $ 2,932 $ 3,256 $ 3,257 $ 154 $ 176 $ 187 Furniture/transportation equipment leasing 739 660 661 155 53 14 Other 343 348 383 465 460 452 $ 4,014 $ 4,264 $ 4,301 Pre-tax earnings 774 689 653 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 258 248 242 $ 516 $ 441 $ 411 Revenues of Clayton Homes were $2.9 billion in 2011, a decline of $324 million (10%) from 2010. Revenues from home sales declined approximately 17%, as unit sales declined about 14%. Sales in 2010 benefitted from the U.S. federal tax credit program offered to homebuyers, which expired on June 30, 2010. In addition, the average price per home sold declined slightly in 2011, as a larger percentage of homes sold were lower priced single section units. Clayton’s financial services income in 2011 also declined slightly, due primarily to lower interest income from installment loans. Net consumer loan balances at December 31, 2011 declined by approximately $600 million from December 31, 2010 to approximately $12.9 billion. The decline reflects runoff of the loan portfolio and fewer new loans. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $154 million in 2011, a decline of $22 million (12.5%) versus 2010. Earnings in 2011 were negatively impacted by lower revenues and a $27 million increase in insurance claims (primarily from severe storms in the spring and summer), partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative and interest expenses. Revenues of Clayton Homes were essentially unchanged in 2010 as compared to 2009. Sales of manufactured homes declined approximately $40 million, reflecting an increase in unit sales of approximately 6%, which was more than offset by lower average selling prices primarily attributable to product mix. Unit sales in the first half of 2010 benefitted from the home buyer tax credit, which expired in the second quarter and as a result demand declined over the second half of the year. Interest and finance income increased in 2010 as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement, which required us to consolidate securitized loan portfolios that we originated several years ago. Upon the adoption of the new accounting standard, our installment loan balances increased approximately $1.5 billion, which was accompanied by a corresponding increase to borrowings. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes decreased $11 million (6%) in 2010 versus 2009. Operating results in 2010 were negatively impacted by reduced earnings from manufactured home sales, partially offset by increased financial services earnings. Clayton Homes’ operating results continue to be negatively affected by the ongoing soft housing markets and the surplus of traditional single family homes for sale. In addition, our manufactured housing programs continue to operate at a competitive disadvantage compared to traditional single family housing markets, which have been receiving significant interest rate subsidies from the U.S. government through government agency insured mortgages. For the most part, these subsidies are not available to factory built homes. Nevertheless, Clayton Homes remains the largest manufactured housing business in the United States and we believe that it will continue to operate profitably, even under the current conditions. 43 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Finance and Financial Products (Continued) Revenues of CORT and XTRA increased $79 million in 2011 compared to 2010, while earnings increased $102 million. The increases in revenues and earnings were primarily attributable to an increased proportion of assets on lease (utilization rates) and lower depreciation expense. A significant portion of the expense structures of our leasing businesses, such as depreciation and facilities expenses, do not change significantly with rental volume, so the impact of revenue changes can have a disproportionate impact on earnings. In 2010, revenues from CORT and XTRA were essentially unchanged from 2009. Pre-tax earnings were $53 million, an increase of $39 million. The earnings increase was primarily attributable to cost containment efforts as well as improved transportation equipment utilization. Earnings from our other finance business activities in each of the past three years included investment income from a portfolio of fixed maturity and equity investments and from a small portfolio of long-held commercial real estate loans. In addition, other earnings include income from interest rate spreads representing the difference between interest rates charged to Clayton Homes on borrowings (approximately $11.5 billion as of December 31, 2011), which are used in connection with its lending activities and interest paid by a Berkshire financing subsidiary to fund the loans to Clayton. A corresponding charge is reflected in Clayton Homes’ earnings. In addition, other finance business activity includes guaranty fee income of $41 million in 2011 and $38 million in 2010 received from NetJets. NetJets has recorded corresponding charges to its earnings. Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows. Amounts are in millions. 2011 2010 2009 Investment gains/losses Sales and other disposals of investments Insurance and other $ 1,991 $ 3,032 $ 277 Finance and financial products 162 9 110 Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments (908 ) (1,973 ) (3,155 ) Other 29 1,017 (69 ) 1,274 2,085 (2,837 ) Derivative gains/losses Credit default contracts (251 ) 250 789 Equity index put option contracts (1,787 ) 172 2,713 Other derivative contracts (66 ) (161 ) 122 (2,104 ) 261 3,624 Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests (830 ) 2,346 787 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (309 ) 472 301 Net gains/losses $ (521 ) $ 1,874 $ 486 Investment gains/losses arise from the sale or redemption of investments. The timing of gains or losses from sales or redemptions can have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses usually have minimal impact on the periodic changes in our consolidated shareholders’ equity since most of our investments are regularly recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with the unrealized gains and losses included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical or predictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will have on our reported earnings. Although our management does not consider investment gains and losses in a given period as necessarily meaningful or useful in evaluating periodic earnings, we are providing information to explain the nature of such gains and losses when they are reflected in earnings. 44 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) Investment gains/losses from sales and other dispositions were $2.2 billion in 2011 and included an aggregate pre-tax gain of $1.8 billion from the redemptions of our GS and GE Preferred investments. In 2010, investment gains/losses from sales and other dispositions included a $1.3 billion gain with respect to the redemption of the Swiss Re capital instrument. Other investment gains and losses were $1.0 billion in 2010, which included a one-time holding gain of $979 million that arose in connection with our acquisition of BNSF as a result of the application of acquisition accounting under GAAP. In each of the three years ending December 31, 2011, we recognized other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses on certain of our equity and fixed maturity investments. In 2011, we recognized OTTI losses related to our investments in Kraft Foods ($169 million) and Wells Fargo ($337 million). Such OTTI losses averaged about 7.5% of the original cost of the impaired securities. As of that time, most of the impaired securities were in an unrealized loss position for more than two years. However, in each case, the issuer had been profitable and we expected and continue to expect that they will remain profitable. As discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the OTTI loss related to Wells Fargo pertained to 103.6 million shares that had unrealized losses determined on a specific identification basis. We also held 255.4 million shares of Wells Fargo in which we had unrealized gains of approximately $3.7 billion as of March 31, 2011. However, none of these gains were included in our past or current earnings. This odd result occurs because existing accounting rules require that impairments be evaluated as to whether or not they are other than temporary on an individual purchase lot basis, since that is how we determine realized investment gains/losses on sales of such investments. In addition, we recorded OTTI losses of approximately $400 million in 2011 on certain debt instruments where, after evaluation, we concluded that we would likely not receive all contractual cash flows when due. Substantially all of these OTTI losses were attributable to a single issuer. OTTI losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 included unrealized losses on equity securities of $938 million. Such losses averaged about 20% of the original cost of the impaired securities. In each case, the issuer had been profitable in recent periods and in some cases highly profitable. In addition, we recorded OTTI losses of $1.0 billion in 2010 on certain debt instruments where, after evaluation, we concluded that we would likely not receive all contractual cash flows when due. Substantially all of these OTTI losses were attributable to a single issuer. OTTI losses in 2009 predominantly related to a loss with respect to our investment in ConocoPhillips common stock. The OTTI losses had no impact whatsoever on the asset values that were recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets or on our consolidated shareholders’ equity as of any given balance sheet date. Although we have periodically recorded OTTI losses in earnings in 2011, 2010 and 2009, we continue to hold positions in certain of the related securities. In cases where the market values of these investments have increased since the dates the OTTI losses were recorded in earnings, these increases are not reflected in earnings but are instead included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The recognition of such losses in earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income does not necessarily indicate that sales are imminent or planned and sales ultimately may not occur for years or even decades. Furthermore, the recognition of OTTI losses does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is permanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost. We consider several factors in determining whether or not impairments are deemed to be other than temporary, including the current and expected long-term business prospects and if applicable, the creditworthiness of the issuer, our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers and the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline. Security prices may remain below cost for a period of time that may be deemed excessive from the standpoint of interpreting existing accounting rules even though other factors suggest that the prices will eventually recover. As a result, accounting regulations may require that we recognize OTTI losses in earnings in instances where we may strongly believe that the market price of the impaired security will recover to at least our original cost and where we possess the ability and intent to hold the security until, at least, that time. As of December 31, 2011, unrealized losses on our investments in equity securities (determined on an individual purchase lot basis) were approximately $1.4 billion. Approximately 91% was concentrated in our investments in banks, insurance and finance companies. Unrealized losses averaged 12% of cost. In our judgment, the future earnings potential and underlying business economics of these companies are favorable and we possess the ability and intent to hold these securities until their prices recover. Changing market conditions and other facts and circumstances may change the business prospects of these issuers as well as our ability and intent to hold these securities until their prices recover. Derivative gains/losses primarily represent the changes in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contracts. Periodic changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of 45 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) underlying equity and credit markets. We have not actively traded into and out of credit default and equity index put option contracts. Under many of the contracts, no settlements will occur until the contract expiration dates, which may occur many years from now. We recorded pre-tax losses of $251 million on our credit default contracts in 2011 and gains of $250 million in 2010 and $789 million in 2009. Gains and losses generated by our credit default contracts reflect changes in the estimated values of the contracts which reflect changes in credit default spreads relative to the remaining terms of the contracts. In 2011, the losses were primarily related to our contracts involving non-investment grade corporate issuers, due to widening credit default spreads and loss events. The gains in 2010 reflected the overall narrowing of credit default spreads for corporate issuers and were somewhat offset by losses due to the widening of spreads for municipalities. The gains from our credit default contracts in 2009 derived primarily from the narrowing of spreads for corporate issuers. During the fourth quarter of 2011, two losses occurred under our contracts covering non-investment grade issuers and one additional loss occurred in early 2012. Our risk of additional cash losses with respect to our non-investment grade issuers will decline significantly in 2012 as a result of contract expirations. We paid $86 million to settle the two losses occurring in 2011. No credit loss events occurred under our contracts in 2010. There were several credit loss events in the first half of 2009, primarily related to contracts involving non-investment grade (or high-yield) corporate issuers and during 2009 we paid losses of about $1.9 billion. In 2011, we recorded pre-tax losses of approximately $1.8 billion on our equity index put option contracts. The losses reflected declines ranging from about 5.5% to 17% with respect to three of the four equity indexes covered under our contracts and lower interest rate inputs. In 2010 and 2009, gains on equity index put option contracts were $172 million and $2.7 billion, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we settled certain equity index put option contracts early at the request of the counterparty. The net gain in 2010 arising from these settled contracts was $561 million, which is represented by the difference between the recorded fair values of the contracts at December 31, 2009 and the settlement payment amounts. Otherwise, we recognized pre-tax losses of $389 million under our remaining equity index put option contracts reflecting generally lower interest rate assumptions and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes. The derivative contract gains in 2009 reflected increases in the underlying equity indexes ranging from approximately 19% to 23%, partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar on non-U.S. equity index put option contracts and lower interest rates. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our remaining equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates, which begin in 2018, based on the intrinsic value as of those dates. Our recorded liability for these contracts was $8.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. Financial Condition Our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2011 was $164.8 billion, an increase of approximately $7.5 billion from December 31, 2010. Consolidated cash and investments of insurance and other businesses approximated $153.9 billion at December 31, 2011, including cash and cash equivalents of $33.5 billion. These assets are held predominantly in our insurance businesses. In February 2011, $2.0 billion of the parent company’s senior unsecured notes matured. In August 2011, we issued $2.0 billion of parent company senior unsecured notes. On January 31, 2012, we issued an additional $1.7 billion of parent company senior unsecured notes, the proceeds of which were used to fund the repayment of $1.7 billion of notes maturing in February 2012. On September 16, 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of The Lubrizol Corporation for cash consideration of $135 per share or approximately $8.7 billion in the aggregate. We funded the acquisition price with existing cash balances. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In late September 2011, our Board of Directors authorized Berkshire Hathaway to repurchase Class A and Class B shares of Berkshire at prices no higher than a 10% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions, at management’s discretion. The repurchase program is expected to continue indefinitely and the amount of purchases will depend entirely upon the levels of cash available, the attractiveness of investment and business opportunities either at hand or on the horizon and the degree of discount of the market price to management’s estimate of intrinsic value. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares. Berkshire plans to use cash on hand to fund repurchases and repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. To date, share repurchases have been insignificant. 46 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and MidAmerican) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make capital expenditures in the normal course of business. In 2011, MidAmerican’s capital expenditures were approximately $2.7 billion, which excluded approximately $750 million of non-cash property and equipment additions that were offset by a corresponding amount of debt or other liabilities. BNSF’s capital expenditures in 2011 were approximately $3.3 billion. MidAmerican’s forecasted capital expenditures for 2012 are $3.8 billion, while BNSF’s forecasted capital expenditures are approximately $3.9 billion. Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded from cash flows from operations and debt issuances. In 2011, BNSF issued debt of $1.5 billion with maturities in 2021 and 2041, and its outstanding debt increased $685 million to $12.7 billion as of December 31. In 2011, MidAmerican’s new borrowings were $1.4 billion and its aggregate outstanding borrowings increased $269 million to $19.9 billion at December 31. MidAmerican and BNSF have aggregate debt and capital lease maturities in 2012 of $2.6 billion. Berkshire has committed until February 28, 2014 to provide up to $2 billion of additional capital to MidAmerican to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund its regulated utility subsidiaries. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, MidAmerican or any of their subsidiaries. Assets of the finance and financial products businesses, which consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, fixed maturity securities, other investments and cash and cash equivalents were approximately $25.0 billion as of December 31, 2011 and $25.7 billion at December 31, 2010. Liabilities were approximately $25.4 billion as of December 31, 2011 and $24.0 billion as of December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011, notes payable and other borrowings of $14.0 billion included approximately $11.5 billion of notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). In January 2011, BHFC issued $1.5 billion of notes and repaid $1.5 billion of maturing notes. In January 2012, $250 million of BHFC notes matured and an additional $2.45 billion will mature in the second and third quarters of 2012. BHFC notes are unsecured and maturities currently range from 2012 to 2040. The proceeds from the BHFC notes are used to finance originated and acquired loans of Clayton Homes. The full and timely payment of principal and interest on the BHFC notes is guaranteed by Berkshire. We regularly access the credit markets, particularly through our parent company and through our railroad, utilities and energy and the finance and financial products businesses. Restricted access to credit markets at affordable rates in the future could have a significant negative impact on our operations. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law financial regulatory reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Reform Act”). The Reform Act reshapes financial regulations in the United States by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and market participants and providing new enforcement powers to regulators. Virtually all major areas of the Reform Act will be subject to regulatory interpretation and implementation rules requiring rulemaking that may take several years to complete. We are party to several equity index put option and credit default contracts as described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. With limited exception, these contracts contain no collateral posting requirements under any circumstances, including changes in either the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts or a downgrade in Berkshire’s credit ratings. Substantially all of these contracts were entered into prior to December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2011, the liabilities recorded for these contracts were approximately $10.0 billion and our collateral posting requirements were $238 million. With respect to such collateral requirements, we receive the income attributable to such collateral or, in certain instances, interest credit from the counterparty. Although the ultimate outcome of the regulatory rulemaking proceedings described in the preceding paragraph cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the provisions of the Reform Act that concern collateral requirements apply to derivatives contracts that were entered into prior to the enactment of the Reform Act, as ours were. As such, although the Reform Act may adversely affect some of our business activities, it is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, which are not currently reflected in the financial statements, such as minimum rentals under operating leases. Such obligations will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date. 47 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Contractual Obligations (Continued) The timing and/or amount of the payments of other obligations are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The timing and amount of payments arising under property and casualty insurance and derivative contract obligations which are reported in other in the table below are contingent upon the outcome of claim settlement activities or events that may occur over many years. Obligations arising under life, annuity and health insurance benefits are estimated based on assumptions as to future premium payments, allowances, mortality, morbidity, expenses and policy lapse rates. The amounts presented in the following table are based on the liability estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011. Although certain insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and life, annuity and health benefits are ceded to and receivable from others under reinsurance contracts, such receivables are not reflected in the table below. A summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 follows. Amounts are in millions.

(2) Before reserve discounts of $2,130 million. (3) Amounts represent estimated undiscounted benefit obligations net of estimated future premiums. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates are necessarily based on assumptions about numerous factors involving varying, and possibly significant, degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements, with the benefit of hindsight, will likely be adjusted in the future based on additional information made available and changes in other facts and circumstances. Property and casualty losses A summary of our consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Except for certain workers’ compensation liabilities, all liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as “gross unpaid losses”) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value, regardless of the length of the claim-tail. Amounts are in millions. Gross unpaid losses Net unpaid losses * Dec. 31, 2011 Dec. 31, 2010 Dec. 31, 2011 Dec. 31, 2010 GEICO $ 10,167 $ 9,376 $ 9,705 $ 8,928 General Re 16,288 16,425 15,267 15,690 BHRG 31,489 29,124 26,413 24,422 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 5,875 5,150 5,442 4,802 Total $ 63,819 $ 60,075 $ 56,827 $ 53,842 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges on reinsurance assumed and before foreign currency translation effects. We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts with respect to losses occurring on or before 48 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of loss payments is subject to a great degree of variability and is contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the determination of the ultimate loss amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used in establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses. Regardless of the techniques used, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amounts payable in the future. As a result, uncertainties are imbedded in and permeate the actuarial loss reserving techniques and processes used. As of any balance sheet date, not all claims that have occurred have been reported and not all reported claims have been settled. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include provisions for reported claims (referred to as “case reserves”) and for claims that have not been reported (referred to as incurred but not yet reported (“IBNR”) reserves). The time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement payment date is referred to as the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within a few years of occurrence. Casualty losses usually have very long claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations. The legal environment further contributes to extending claim-tails. Receivables are recorded with respect to losses ceded to other reinsurers and are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses. In addition to the factors cited above, reinsurance receivables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders. We utilize processes and techniques to establish liability estimates that are believed to best fit the particular business. Additional information regarding those processes and techniques of our significant insurance businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows. GEICO GEICO’s gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities as of December 31, 2011 were $10.2 billion, which included $7.3 billion of reported average, case and case development reserves and $2.9 billion of IBNR reserves. GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance which has a relatively short claim-tail. The key assumptions affecting the setting of our reserves include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”), which includes loss adjustment expenses. Our reserving methodologies produce reserve estimates based upon the individual claims (or a “ground-up” approach), which yields an aggregate estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Ranges of loss estimates are not determined in the aggregate. Our actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserves using recognized standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The significant reserve components (and percentage of gross reserves as of December 31, 2011) are: (1) average reserves (15%), (2) case and case development reserves (60%) and (3) IBNR reserves (25%). Each component of loss reserves is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. Such amounts are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, rated state, reporting date and occurrence date, among other ways. A brief discussion of each reserve component follows. We establish average reserve amounts for reported auto damage claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. The average reserves are intended to represent a reasonable estimate for incurred claims for which our claims adjusters have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that are paid within a relatively short time after being reported. Average reserve amounts are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened. Our claims adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as soon as the specific facts and merits of each claim can be evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised as more information becomes known. 49 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) For most liability coverages, case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim-tail, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is established. Therefore, we establish additional case development reserve estimates, which are usually percentages of the case reserve. As of December 31, 2011, case development reserves averaged approximately 25% of total established case reserves. In general, case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves. Case development factors are reviewed and revised periodically. For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are subtracted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established through the collaborative effort of actuarial, claims and other management. For each significant coverage, we test the adequacy of the total loss reserves using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense estimates recorded at the end of 2010 developed downward by $474 million when reevaluated through December 31, 2011, producing a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2011. These downward reserve developments represented approximately 3.1% of earned premiums in 2011 and approximately 5.1% of prior year-end recorded liabilities. Reserving assumptions at December 31, 2011 were modified appropriately to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future reserve development will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated. Within the automobile line of business, reserves for liability coverages are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails. Approximately 92% of GEICO’s reserves as of December 31, 2011 were for automobile liability, of which bodily injury (“BI”) coverage accounted for approximately 55%. We believe it is reasonably possible that the average BI severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used. If actual BI severity changes one percentage point from what was used in establishing the reserves, our reserves would develop up or down by approximately $147 million resulting in a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to be different from expected would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. Our exposure at GEICO to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining liabilities associated with such exposure are currently a relatively insignificant component of GEICO’s total reserves (approximately 1.8%) and there is minimal apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure. Related claim activity over the past year was insignificant. General Re and BHRG Liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses of our General Re and BHRG underwriting units derive primarily from assumed reinsurance. Additional uncertainties are unique to the processes used in estimating such reinsurance liabilities. The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which are affected by market conditions and practices) and other factors. Due to the lack of standardization of contract terms and conditions, the wide variability of coverage needs of individual clients and the tendency for those needs to change rapidly in response to market conditions, the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainties, in and of themselves, cannot be reliably measured. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative, per occurrence excess or retroactive contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract. This occurs when our personnel either works closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manages the claims themselves. However, loss 50 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re and BHRG (Continued) information related to aggregate excess-of-loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Occasionally, loss information is reported in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is usually provided through periodic reports and may include the amount of ceded losses paid where reimbursement is sought as well as case loss reserve estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers. Each of our reinsurance businesses has established practices to identify and gather needed information from clients. These practices include, for example, comparison of expected premiums to reported premiums to help identify delinquent client reports and claim reviews to facilitate loss reporting and identify inaccurate or incomplete claim reporting. These practices are periodically evaluated and changed as conditions, risk factors and unanticipated areas of exposures are identified. The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is delayed in comparison with primary insurance. In some instances there are multiple reinsurers assuming and ceding parts of an underlying risk causing multiple contractual intermediaries between us and the primary insured. In these instances, the delays in reporting can be compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer varies depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms and other factors. Contracts covering casualty losses on a per occurrence excess basis may experience longer delays in reporting due to the length of the claim-tail as regards to the underlying claim. In addition, ceding companies may not report claims to the reinsurer until they believe it is reasonably possible that the reinsurer will be affected, usually determined as a function of its estimate of the claim amount as a percentage of the reinsurance contract retention. However, the timing of reporting large per occurrence excess property losses or property catastrophe losses may not vary significantly from primary insurance. Under contracts where periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies, such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals which in the U.S. range from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. Outside the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices vary. In certain countries, clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. The different client reporting practices generally do not result in a significant increase in risk or uncertainty as the actuarial reserving methodologies are adjusted to compensate for the delays. Premium and loss data is provided to us through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data provided is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Reinsurance contracts generally allow us to have access to the cedant’s books and records with respect to the subject business and provide us the ability to conduct audits to determine the accuracy and completeness of information. Audits are conducted as we deem them appropriate. In the normal course of business, disputes with clients occasionally arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through the involvement of our claims department personnel and the appropriate client personnel or by independent outside counsel. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or alternative dispute resolution will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In summary, the scope, number and potential variability of assumptions required in estimating ultimate losses from reinsurance contracts are more uncertain than primary property and casualty insurance due to the factors previously discussed. 51 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re General Re’s gross and net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and gross reserves by major line of business as of December 31, 2011 are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Type Line of business Reported case reserves $ 8,528 Workers’ compensation (1) $ 2,955 IBNR reserves 7,760 Professional liability (2) 723 Gross reserves 16,288 Mass tort-asbestos/environmental 1,642 Ceded reserves and deferred charges (1,021 ) Auto liability 3,093 Net reserves $ 15,267 Other casualty (3) 2,277 Other general liability 2,648 Property 2,950 Total $ 16,288 (1) Net of discounts of $2,130 million. (2) Includes directors and officers and errors and omissions coverage. (3) Includes medical malpractice and umbrella coverage. The discussion that follows describes our process of establishing loss reserve estimates at General Re. Our loss reserve estimation process is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (“ACRs”) and IBNR reserves. Critical judgments in establishing loss reserves involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the expectation of ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and comparison of case reserve reporting trends to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded reserve amounts are subject to “tail risk” where reported losses develop beyond the maximum expected loss emergence pattern time period. We do not routinely determine loss reserve ranges because we believe that the techniques necessary to make such determinations have not sufficiently developed and that the myriad of assumptions required render such resulting ranges to be unreliable. In addition, counts of claims or average amounts per claim are not utilized because clients do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail. Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, our claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners’ estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners’ estimates are significantly greater than the ceding company’s estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACRs are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2011, ACRs aggregated approximately $2.6 billion before discounts and were concentrated in workers’ compensation reserves, and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. Our examiners also periodically conduct detailed claim reviews of individual clients and case reserves are often increased as a result. In 2011, we conducted 288 claim reviews. Our actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (“reserve cells”) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative and program) and line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, etc.). For each reserve cell, premiums and losses are aggregated by accident year, policy year or underwriting year (depending on client reporting practices) and analyzed over time. We internally refer to these loss aggregations as loss triangles, which serve as the primary basis for our IBNR reserve calculations. We review over 300 reserve cells for our North American business and approximately 900 reserve cells with respect to our international business. We use loss triangles to determine the expected case loss emergence patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, loss triangles are further used to determine IBNR reserves. While additional calculations form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern, the determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly a mechanical process. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, we use estimation formulas along with reliance on other loss triangles and judgment. Factors affecting our loss development triangles include but are not limited to the following: changes in client claims practices, changes in claim examiners’ use of ACRs or the frequency of client 52 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) company claim reviews, changes in policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. Collectively, these factors influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns. We select expected loss ratios by reserve cell, by accident year, based upon reviewing forecasted losses and indicated ultimate loss ratios that are predicted from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premium. If the selected emergence pattern is not accurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios may not be accurate, which can affect the selected loss ratios and hence the IBNR reserve. As with selected loss emergence patterns, selecting expected loss ratios is not a strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing loss ratios. We estimate IBNR reserves by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, our actuaries calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year. These calculations do not involve new assumptions and use the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year. In 2011, our reported claims for prior years’ workers’ compensation losses were less than expected by $148 million. However, further analysis of the workers’ compensation reserve cells by segment indicated the need for maintaining IBNR. These developments precipitated a net increase of $94 million in nominal IBNR reserve estimates for unreported occurrences. After adjusting for the $121 million net increase in liabilities from changes in net reserve discounts during the year, the net increase in workers’ compensation losses from prior years’ occurrences reduced pre-tax earnings in 2011 by $67 million. To illustrate the sensitivity of changes in expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios for our significant excess-of-loss workers’ compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves of approximately $735 million and $382 million on a discounted basis as of December 31, 2011. The increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates. Our other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) developed downwards in 2011 relative to expectations. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given year means that loss reserve amounts currently established will continue to develop favorably. For our significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells (including medical malpractice, umbrella, auto and general liability), an increase of five points in the tails of the expected emergence patterns and an increase of five percent in expected loss ratios (one percent for large international proportional reserve cells) would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $912 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $912 million. Overall, our property losses were greater than expected in 2011 as a result of catastrophe losses during the year. As a result, our unpaid losses for property lines increased in 2011 by approximately $400 million from December 31, 2010. However, the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses. In addition, in response to favorable claim development information received during the year, estimated remaining World Trade Center losses were reduced by $62 million. In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (“D&O and E&O”) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected emergence patterns. These cells often involve a spike in loss activity arising from recent industry developments making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern. For our large D&O and E&O reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern (for those cells where emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a 53 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $174 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates. Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, “mass tort”) claims. Gross unpaid mass tort liabilities at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were approximately $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, mass tort liabilities, net of reinsurance, were approximately $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Mass tort net claims paid were $58 million in 2011. In 2011, ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims were increased by $39 million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider “survival ratios” based on net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. The survival ratio based on claim payments made over the last three years was approximately 16 years as of December 31, 2011. The reinsurance industry’s survival ratio for asbestos and pollution reserves was approximately 9.5 years based on the three years ending December 31, 2010. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. BHRG BHRG’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2011 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions. Property Casualty Total Reported case reserves $ 2,274 $ 3,445 $ 5,719 IBNR reserves 2,406 4,576 6,982 Retroactive — 18,788 18,788 Gross reserves $ 4,680 $ 26,809 31,489 Deferred charges and ceded reserves (5,076 ) Net reserves $ 26,413 In general, the methodologies we use to establish loss reserves vary widely and encompass many of the common methodologies employed in the actuarial field today. Certain traditional methodologies such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques are utilized as well as ground-up techniques where appropriate. Additional judgments must also be employed to consider changes in contract conditions and terms as well as the incidence of litigation or legal and regulatory change. As of December 31, 2011, our gross loss reserves related to retroactive reinsurance policies were predominately for casualty or liability losses. Our retroactive policies include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses (relating to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date) above a contractual retention are indemnified or contracts that indemnify all losses paid by the counterparty after the policy effective date. We paid retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses of approximately $1.6 billion in 2011. The classification “reported case reserves” has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since the amount is often derived from reports in bulk from ceding companies, who may have inconsistent definitions of “case reserves.” We review and establish loss reserve estimates, including estimates of IBNR reserves, in the aggregate by contract. In establishing retroactive reinsurance reserves, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. We assign judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, we reassess expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process. During 2011, retroactive reserves developed downward by approximately $1.1 billion. 54 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG (Continued) BHRG’s liabilities for environmental, asbestos and latent injury losses and loss adjustment expenses were approximately $12.3 billion at December 31, 2011 and $10.7 billion at December 31, 2010 and were concentrated within retroactive reinsurance contracts. We paid losses in 2011 attributable to these exposures of approximately $865 million. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not regularly receive reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies on a consistent basis, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, we conduct a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data of the reinsured to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, our estimates can only be developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. Potential legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on establishing loss reserves for mass tort claims in the future. The maximum losses payable under our retroactive policies is not expected to exceed approximately $35 billion as of December 31, 2011. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we currently believe it unlikely that gross unpaid losses as of December 31, 2011 ($18.8 billion) will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15%. A significant number of our reinsurance contracts are expected to have a low frequency of claim occurrence combined with a potential for high severity of claims. These include property losses from catastrophes, terrorism and aviation risks under catastrophe and individual risk contracts. Loss reserves related to catastrophe and individual risk contracts were approximately $2.0 billion at December 31, 2011, an increase of about $700 million from December 31, 2010. In 2011, changes in estimated losses for prior years’ events had an insignificant effect on pre-tax earnings. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Catastrophe loss reserves are provided when it is probable that an insured loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event. Other reinsurance reserve amounts are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on an individual contract basis, supplemented by management’s judgment of the impact on each contract of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon management’s judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding company’s loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared. Derivative contract liabilities Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant amounts of derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. Our significant derivative contract exposures are concentrated in credit default and equity index put option contracts. These contracts were primarily entered into in over-the-counter markets and certain elements in the terms and conditions of such contracts are not standardized. In particular, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. Furthermore, there is no source of independent data available to us showing trading volume and actual prices of completed transactions. As a result, the values of these liabilities are primarily based on valuation models, discounted cash flow models or other valuation techniques that are believed to be used by market participants. Such models or other valuation techniques may use inputs that are observable in the marketplace, while others are unobservable. Unobservable inputs require us to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in establishing prices. Considerable judgment may be required in making assumptions, including the selection of interest rates, default and recovery rates and volatility. Changes in assumptions may have a significant effect on values. The fair values of our high yield credit default contracts are primarily based on indications of bid/ask pricing data. The bid/ask data represents non-binding indications of prices for which similar contracts would be exchanged. Pricing data for the high yield index contracts is obtained from one to three sources depending on the particular index. For the single name and municipal 55 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Derivative contract liabilities (Continued) issuer credit default contracts, our fair values are generally based on credit default spread information obtained from our reporting sources. We monitor and review pricing and spread data for consistency as well as reasonableness with respect to current market conditions. We make no significant adjustments to the pricing data obtained. Further, we make no significant adjustments to fair values for non-performance risk. We concluded that the values produced from this data (without adjustment) reasonably represented the values for which we could have transferred these liabilities. Prices in a current actual settlement could differ significantly from the fair values used in the financial statements. We do not operate as a derivatives dealer and currently we do not utilize offsetting strategies to hedge these contracts. We intend to allow our credit default contracts to run off to their respective expiration dates. We determine the estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts based on the widely used Black-Scholes based option valuation model. Inputs to the model include the current index value, strike price, discount rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted average discount and dividend rates used as of December 31, 2011 were 3.3% and 3.0%, respectively, and were approximately 3.7% and 2.9%, respectively, as of December 31, 2010. The discount rates as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 were approximately 153 basis points and 82 basis points (on a weighted average basis), respectively, over benchmark interest rates and represented an estimate of the spread between our borrowing rates and the benchmark rates for comparable durations. The spread adjustments were based on spreads for our obligations and obligations for comparably rated issuers. We believe the most significant economic risks relate to changes in the index value component and to a lesser degree to the foreign currency component. The Black-Scholes based model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. Our contracts have an average remaining maturity of about 9 years. The weighted average volatility used as of December 31, 2011 was approximately 21.4%, which was relatively unchanged from 2010. The weighted average volatilities are based on the volatility input for each equity index put option contract weighted by the notional value of each equity index put option contract as compared to the aggregate notional value of all equity index put option contracts. The volatility input for each equity index put option contract is based upon the implied volatility at the inception of each equity index put option contract. The impact on fair value as of December 31, 2011 ($8.5 billion) from changes in volatility is summarized below. The values of contracts in an actual exchange are affected by market conditions and perceptions of the buyers and sellers. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model. Dollars are in millions. Hypothetical change in volatility (percentage points) Hypothetical fair value Increase 2 percentage points $ 8,950 Increase 4 percentage points 9,407 Decrease 2 percentage points 8,057 Decrease 4 percentage points 7,628 Other Critical Accounting Policies We record deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the difference between the consideration received and the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. Deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of remaining loss payments. Adjustments to these assumptions are applied retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were approximately $4.1 billion at December 31, 2011. Significant changes in the estimated amount and payment timing of unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $53.2 billion, which includes $3.9 billion arising from our acquisition of Lubrizol in September 2011. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2011. Such tests include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted 56 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Other Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual future results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then individual assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is then charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Interest Rate Risk We regularly invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire such securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur with respect to assets. We also strive to maintain high credit ratings so that the cost of our debt is minimized. We utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks on a limited basis. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate investments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate investments. 57 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Interest Rate Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that no other significant factors change that determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Equity Price Risk Historically, we have maintained large amounts of invested assets in exchange traded equity securities. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices and prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments may be concentrated in relatively few investees. At December 31, 2011, approximately 57% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated in four investees. We prefer to hold equity investments for very long periods of time so we are not troubled by short-term price volatility with respect to our investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. We strive to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short-term equity price volatility. Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. 58 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Equity Price Risk (Continued) We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate potential loss with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, the change in fair value resulting from current changes in the index values are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract. These contracts expire between 2018 and 2026 and may not be unilaterally settled before their respective expiration dates. The following table summarizes our equity and other investments and derivative contract liabilities with equity price risk as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. The effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates are also shown. The selected 30% hypothetical changes do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

Foreign Currency Risk We generally do not use derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency price changes primarily because of the natural hedging that occurs between assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial statements of subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. Dollar as their functional currency are translated into U.S. Dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in earnings primarily as a result of the translation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities held by our U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, we hold investments in major multinational companies that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own, such as The Coca-Cola Company. Our net assets subject to translation are primarily in our insurance and utilities and energy businesses, and to a lesser extent in our manufacturing and services businesses. The translation impact is somewhat offset by transaction gains or losses on net reinsurance liabilities of certain U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies as well as the equity index put option liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries relating to contracts that would be settled in foreign currencies. 59 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Commodity Price Risk Our diverse group of operating businesses use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We utilize derivative contracts to a limited degree in managing commodity price risks, most notably through MidAmerican. MidAmerican’s exposures to commodities include variations in the price of fuel to generate electricity, wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold and natural gas supply for customers. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage and transmission and transportation constraints. To mitigate a portion of the risk, MidAmerican uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Accordingly, net unrealized gains and losses associated with interim price movements on such contracts are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Financial results would be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. MidAmerican also uses futures, options and swap agreements to economically hedge gas and electric commodity prices for physical delivery to non-regulated customers. MidAmerican does not engage in a material amount of proprietary trading activities. The table that follows summarizes our commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of MidAmerican as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of each date.

The principal important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane or act of terrorism that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. 60 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on the following page.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.

(2) Includes earnings of Lubrizol from September 16. Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. Our operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance efforts, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate “tone at the top” messages to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. The business segment data (Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Insurance underwriting results in 2012 included after-tax losses of approximately $725 million from Hurricane Sandy. In 2011 and 2010, underwriting results included after-tax losses of approximately $1.7 billion and $600 million, respectively, from catastrophe events occurring in those years. Our railroad and utilities and energy businesses continued to generate significant earnings in 2012. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2012 increased significantly over 2011 due primarily to the acquisition of The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”), which was completed on September 16, 2011. Excluding the impact of Lubrizol, earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses were mixed, reflecting significant improvements in our carpet business, modest improvements in our other building products businesses in the U.S., and earnings declines in several foreign markets of our manufacturing and service operations. In 2012, after-tax investment and derivative gains were approximately $2.2 billion, which included reductions in estimated liabilities under equity index put option contracts, settlements and expirations of credit default contracts and net gains from investment disposals. In 2011, after-tax investment and derivative losses were $521 million, reflecting after-tax losses of $1.2 billion related to increases in liabilities under our equity index put option contracts and other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses of $590 million related to certain equity and fixed maturity securities, partially offset by after-tax investment gains of $1.2 billion from the redemptions of our Goldman Sachs and General Electric Preferred Stock investments. In 2010, after-tax investment and derivative gains were $1,874 million, and included a one-time holding gain of $979 million related to our acquisition of BNSF, net gains from the dispositions of investments and net gains from derivative contracts, partially offset by OTTI losses recorded with respect to certain fixed maturity and equity securities. We believe that investment gains/losses are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance. The timing and magnitude of investment and derivative gains and losses has caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 30 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing decisions, with limited exceptions, are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results. In 2012, we recorded aggregate pre-tax losses of approximately $1.1 billion attributable to Hurricane Sandy. In 2011, we recorded pre-tax losses of approximately $2.6 billion, arising primarily from the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand in the first quarter, as well as weather related events in the Pacific Rim and the U.S. Our periodic underwriting results are regularly affected by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. In 2011, we reduced estimated liabilities related to certain retroactive reinsurance contracts which resulted in an increase in pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $875 million. These reductions were primarily due to lower than expected loss experience of one ceding company. Actual claim settlements and revised loss estimates will develop over time, which will likely differ from the liability estimates recorded as of year-end (approximately $64 billion). Accordingly, the unpaid loss estimates recorded as of December 31, 2012 may develop upward or downward in future periods with a corresponding decrease or increase, respectively, to pre-tax earnings. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based subsidiaries as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In recent years, currency exchange rates have been volatile and the resulting impact on our underwriting earnings has been significant. A key marketing strategy followed by all of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $106 billion at December 31, 2012. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers. Underwriting results from our insurance businesses are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. 2012 2011 2010 Underwriting gain (loss) attributable to: GEICO $ 680 $ 576 $ 1,117 General Re 355 144 452 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 304 (714 ) 176 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 286 242 268 Pre-tax underwriting gain 1,625 248 2,013 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 579 94 712 Net underwriting gain $ 1,046 $ 154 $ 1,301 31 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO Through GEICO, we primarily write private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO’s policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. This is a significant element in our strategy to be a low-cost auto insurer. In addition, we strive to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICO’s underwriting results are summarized below. Dollars are in millions. 2012 2011 2010 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 17,129 $ 15,664 $ 14,494 Premiums earned $ 16,740 100.0 $ 15,363 100.0 $ 14,283 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 12,700 75.9 12,013 78.2 10,631 74.4 Underwriting expenses 3,360 20.0 2,774 18.1 2,535 17.8 Total losses and expenses 16,060 95.9 14,787 96.3 13,166 92.2 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 680 $ 576 $ 1,117 Premiums earned in 2012 were approximately $16.7 billion, an increase of $1,377 million (9.0%) over 2011. The growth in premiums earned for voluntary auto was 9.0% as a result of a 6.5% increase in policies-in-force and an increase in average premium per policy over the past twelve months. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2012 increased slightly compared with 2011. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2012 were approximately 704,000 greater than at December 31, 2011. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2012 were $12.7 billion, an increase of $687 million (5.7%) over 2011. Our loss ratio (the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned) was 75.9% in 2012 and 78.2% in 2011. We incurred losses (net of estimated salvage) of $490 million from Hurricane Sandy in the fourth quarter of 2012. For the year, catastrophe losses were $638 million (3.8 loss ratio points) in 2012 compared to $252 million (1.6 loss ratio points) in 2011. Our loss ratio declined in 2012 as compared to 2011. Claims frequencies for property damage and collision coverages were down about one percent, comprehensive coverage frequencies were down about ten percent, excluding Hurricane Sandy, and frequencies for bodily injury coverages were relatively unchanged. In 2012, frequencies were lower in the second half of the year than they were in the first half. Physical damage severities increased in the two to four percent range and bodily injury severities increased in the one to three percent range from 2011. Underwriting expenses incurred in 2012 increased $586 million (21.1%) compared with 2011. The increase was primarily the result of a change in U.S. GAAP concerning deferred policy acquisition costs (“DPAC”). DPAC represents the underwriting costs that are eligible to be capitalized and expensed as premiums are earned over the policy period. Upon adoption of the new accounting standard as of January 1, 2012, GEICO ceased deferring a large portion of its advertising costs. The new accounting standard was adopted on a prospective basis and as a result, DPAC recorded as of December 31, 2011 was amortized to expense over the remainder of the related policy periods in 2012. Policy acquisition costs related to policies written and renewed after December 31, 2011 are being deferred at lower levels than in the past. The new accounting standard for DPAC does not impact the cash basis periodic underwriting costs or our assessment of GEICO’s underwriting performance. However, the new accounting standard accelerates the timing of when certain underwriting costs are recognized in earnings. We estimate that GEICO’s underwriting expenses in 2012 would have been about $410 million less had we computed DPAC under the prior accounting standard and that, as a result, GEICO’s expense ratio (the ratio of underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in 2012 would have been less than in 2011. Premiums earned in 2011 increased $1,080 million (7.6%) over 2010. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 7.0% as compared to 2010. The increase in policies-in-force in 2011 reflected an increase of 9.4% in voluntary auto new business sales. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2011 were approximately 709,000 greater than at December 31, 2010. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2011 increased $1,382 million (13.0%) as compared to 2010, increasing at a greater rate than premiums earned. As a result, the loss ratio increased from 74.4% in 2010 to 78.2% in 2011. The increase in the loss ratio in 2011 was primarily due to higher average injury and physical damage severities estimates and increased 32 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) catastrophe losses incurred. In 2011, bodily injury severities estimates generally increased in the three to six percent range over 2010, while physical damage severities increased in the three to five percent range. In 2011, catastrophe losses were $252 million compared with $109 million in 2010. In 2011, underwriting expenses increased $239 million (9.4%) over 2010. The increase reflected additional advertising and increased payroll costs related to generating new business and servicing existing business. General Re Through General Re, we conduct a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. We write property and casualty reinsurance in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Germany-based General Reinsurance AG and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG. General Re strives to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines. Our management does not evaluate underwriting performance based upon market share and our underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Re’s underwriting results are summarized in the following table. Amounts are in millions. Premiums written Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 Property/casualty $ 2,982 $ 2,910 $ 2,923 $ 2,904 $ 2,941 $ 2,979 $ 399 $ 7 $ 289 Life/health 3,002 2,909 2,709 2,966 2,875 2,714 (44 ) 137 163 $ 5,984 $ 5,819 $ 5,632 $ 5,870 $ 5,816 $ 5,693 $ 355 $ 144 $ 452 Property/casualty Property/casualty premiums written in 2012 increased $72 million (2.5%), while premiums earned declined $37 million (1.3%) from 2011. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written increased $158 million (5.4%) compared to 2011, which reflected increased volume in most of our major markets around the globe. Before the effects of currency exchange, premiums earned in 2012 increased $61 million (2.1%) over 2011, which was primarily attributable to an increase in European property treaty business. Price competition in most property and casualty lines persists and the volume of business written in recent years has been less than our capacity. Our underwriters continue to exercise discipline by not accepting offers to write business where prices are deemed inadequate. We remain prepared to increase premium volumes should market conditions improve. Property/casualty operations produced net underwriting gains of $399 million in 2012 which consisted of $352 million of gains from our property business and $47 million of gains from casualty/workers’ compensation business. Our property results included $266 million of catastrophe losses primarily attributable to Hurricane Sandy, the earthquake in Northern Italy and various tornadoes in the Midwest. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual losses has produced and is expected to continue to produce significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. The underwriting gains from casualty/workers’ compensation business included favorable run-off of prior years’ business, offset in part by $105 million of recurring accretion of discounted workers’ compensation liabilities and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance contracts written many years ago. Premiums written in 2011 were relatively unchanged from 2010, while premiums earned in 2011 declined $38 million (1.3%) from 2010. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written and earned in 2011 declined $94 million (3.2%) and $132 million (4.4%), respectively, compared with 2010. The declines reflected lower premium volume in North American property treaty business, substantially offset by higher premiums in European property lines and broker market motor liability business. Underwriting gains were $7 million in 2011 and consisted of a net underwriting gain of $127 million from casualty/workers’ compensation business substantially offset by a net underwriting loss of $120 million from property business. Our property results included $861 million of catastrophe losses. The catastrophe losses were primarily attributable to the earthquakes in New Zealand and Japan, as well as to weather related loss events in the United States, Europe and Australia. The underwriting gain of $127 million from casualty/workers’ compensation business reflected overall reductions in prior years’ loss reserve estimates, due generally to lower than expected claim reports from cedants, which was partially offset by $111 million of accretion of discounted workers’ compensation liabilities and deferred charge amortization. 33 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) Underwriting gains were $289 million in 2010 and consisted of gains of $236 million from property business and $53 million from casualty/workers’ compensation business. The property results included $339 million of catastrophe losses incurred primarily from the Chilean and New Zealand earthquakes and weather related losses in Europe, Australia and New England, offset by reductions in liability estimates for prior years’ losses. The underwriting gains of $53 million from casualty/workers’ compensation business reflected overall reductions in estimated prior years’ loss reserves, offset in part by $125 million of accretion of discounted workers’ compensation liabilities and amortization of deferred charges. Life/health In 2012, written premiums increased $93 million (3.2%) and earned premiums increased $91 million (3.2%) from 2011. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written and earned increased $239 million (8.2%) and $236 million (8.2%), respectively, compared to 2011. The increases in premiums written and earned can be primarily attributed to increased writings in non-U.S. life business. Life/health operations produced a net underwriting loss of $44 million in 2012. The underwriting results were negatively impacted by a premium deficiency reserve we established on our U.S. long-term care book of business which has been in run-off for almost a decade. In addition, underwriting results were negatively impacted in 2012 by greater than expected claims frequency and duration in the individual and group disability business in Australia. Premiums earned in 2011 were $2,875 million, an increase of 5.9% over 2010. Adjusting for the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums earned increased 2.2% over 2010. The increase in premiums earned was primarily due to higher volumes of international life business, which represented about 60% of aggregate life/health premiums earned. The life/health operations produced net underwriting gains of $137 million in 2011 and $163 million in 2010. Underwriting results for 2011 included losses of $15 million attributable to the earthquake in Japan. Underwriting results in 2011 and 2010 were impacted by generally lower than expected mortality in the life business. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group Through BHRG, we underwrite excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages on property and casualty risks for insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG’s business includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and excess primary insurance and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual property risks referred to as individual risk. BHRG also writes retroactive reinsurance, which provides indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Other multi-line property/casualty refers to various coverages written on both a quota-share and excess basis and includes a 20% quota-share contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. (“Swiss Re”) covering substantially all of Swiss Re’s property/casualty risks incepting between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012. The Swiss Re quota-share contract was not renewed in 2013. BHRG’s underwriting activities also include life reinsurance and annuity businesses. BHRG’s underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in millions. Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain/loss 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 Catastrophe and individual risk $ 816 $ 751 $ 623 $ 400 $ (321 ) $ 260 Retroactive reinsurance 717 2,011 2,621 (201 ) 645 (90 ) Other multi-line property/casualty 5,306 4,224 3,459 295 (338 ) 203 Life and annuity 2,833 2,161 2,373 (190 ) (700 ) (197 ) $ 9,672 $ 9,147 $ 9,076 $ 304 $ (714 ) $ 176 Catastrophe and individual risk contracts may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification and cover catastrophe risks (such as hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters) or other property and liability risks. The timing and magnitude of losses produces extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results of this business. Catastrophe and individual risk premiums written approximated $785 million in 2012, $720 million in 2011 and $584 million in 2010. The level of business written in a given period will vary significantly due to changes in market conditions and management’s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. We have constrained the volume of business written in recent years as premium rates have not been attractive enough to warrant significantly increasing volume. However, we have the 34 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) capacity and desire to write substantially more business when appropriate pricing can be obtained. Premiums earned in 2012 from catastrophe and individual risk contracts exceeded 2011 by $65 million (9%), which increased 21% compared with 2010. In 2012, catastrophe and individual risk underwriting results reflected estimated losses of $96 million in connection with Hurricane Sandy. In 2011, we incurred estimated losses of approximately $800 million attributable to the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, while in 2010 we incurred estimated losses of $322 million arising from several loss events. Changes in estimated losses attributable to prior years’ events were relatively insignificant in 2012 and 2011. In 2010, underwriting results were favorably impacted from the reductions of estimated unpaid losses for prior years’ loss events due to lower than expected reported claims. Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events, and related claims are generally expected to be paid over long periods of time. Premiums and limits of indemnification are often very large in amount. Coverages are generally subject to policy limits. Premiums earned in 2012 derived from several relatively small contracts. Premiums earned under retroactive reinsurance contracts in 2011 included approximately $1.7 billion from a reinsurance contract with Eaglestone Reinsurance Company, a subsidiary of American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”). Under the contract, we agreed to reinsure the bulk of AIG’s U.S. asbestos liabilities. The agreement provides for a maximum limit of indemnification of $3.5 billion. Premiums earned in 2010 included approximately $2.25 billion from a contract with Continental Casualty Company, a subsidiary of CNA Financial Corporation, and several of its other insurance subsidiaries (collectively the “CNA Companies”). Under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, BHRG assumed certain asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities of the CNA Companies subject to an aggregate limit of indemnification of $4 billion. Underwriting results attributable to retroactive reinsurance include the recurring periodic amortization of deferred charges that are established with respect to these contracts. At the inception of a contract, deferred charge assets are recorded as the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate losses payable over the premiums earned. Deferred charge balances are subsequently amortized over the estimated claims payment period using the interest method, which reflects estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments. Deferred charge balances are also adjusted to reflect changes in the timing and amount of actual and re-estimated future loss payments. The recurring periodic amortization of deferred charges and deferred charge adjustments resulting from changes to the estimated timing and amount of loss payments are included in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, unamortized deferred charges for all of BHRG’s retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $3.9 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. In 2012, the underwriting loss from retroactive reinsurance contracts was $201 million, which was primarily attributable to deferred charge amortization. In 2012, changes in estimated ultimate unpaid losses with respect to prior years’ contracts were not significant. In 2011, the net underwriting gain from retroactive reinsurance contracts was $645 million. The net gain reflected the favorable impact of a reduction of approximately $865 million in the estimated liability originally established under an adverse loss development contract with Swiss Re, which was attributable to better than expected loss experience. In 2010, underwriting results benefitted from reductions in liabilities for prior years’ contracts and slower than expected loss payments. Gross unpaid losses from retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $18.0 billion at December 31, 2012, $18.8 billion at December 31, 2011 and $18.7 billion as of December 31, 2010. Premiums earned from other multi-line property and casualty business included $3.4 billion in 2012, $2.9 billion in 2011 and $2.4 billion in 2010 from the Swiss Re 20% quota-share contract. As previously noted, the Swiss Re quota-share contract expired on December 31, 2012. Unearned premiums as of December 31, 2012 ($1.4 billion) will be earned as the contract runs off, with a majority of that amount to be earned in 2013. Accordingly, multi-line premium volume is expected to decline significantly in 2013. Underwriting results of our other multi-line property/casualty business can be significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses. In 2012, we incurred estimated losses of $268 million from Hurricane Sandy. In 2011 and 2010, other multi-line property and casualty business included estimated catastrophe losses of approximately $933 million and $308 million, respectively. In 2011, the losses were primarily from the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand and from floods in Thailand, while the losses in 2010 related to the Chilean and New Zealand earthquakes, the Gulf of Mexico BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion and Australian floods. The catastrophe losses in all three years arose primarily under the Swiss Re quota-share contract. 35 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Multi-line property/casualty underwriting results regularly include foreign currency transaction gains or losses associated with the changes in the valuation of certain reinsurance liabilities of U.S. based subsidiaries (including liabilities arising under retroactive reinsurance contracts) denominated in foreign currencies as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Underwriting results included foreign currency transaction losses of $123 million in 2012, gains of $140 million in 2011 and losses of $168 million in 2010. Life and annuity premiums earned in 2012 increased $672 million (31%) over 2011, which was attributable to new annuity contracts. Premiums earned in 2011 and 2010 primarily derived from a life reinsurance contract entered into in January 2010 with Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc. (“SRLHA”) and a life reinsurance business acquired as of December 31, 2010 from Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada. In 2012, the life reinsurance business produced underwriting losses of $12 million versus $582 million in 2011 and $83 million in 2010. In 2011, we recorded a pre-tax underwriting loss of $642 million with respect to the SRLHA contract. Mortality rates under that contract have persistently exceeded the assumptions we made at the inception of the contract. During the fourth quarter of 2011, after considerable internal actuarial analysis, our management concluded that future mortality rates are expected to be greater than our original assumptions. As a result, we increased our estimated liabilities for future policyholder benefits to reflect the new assumptions. The liabilities established in connection with the SRLHA contract reflect our best estimates for expected mortality, lapse rates, future premiums on the underlying policies and discount rates. We do not currently believe significant additional net underwriting losses under this contract are likely. The annuity business generated underwriting losses of $178 million in 2012, $118 million in 2011 and $114 million in 2010. Annuity underwriting losses reflect the periodic discount accretion of the discounted liabilities established for such contracts as well as adjustments for mortality experience. At December 31, 2012, annuity liabilities were approximately $3.8 billion, an increase of approximately $1.7 billion since December 31, 2011, reflecting the aforementioned increase in new business in 2012. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group Our primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses that principally write liability coverages for commercial accounts. These businesses include: Medical Protective Company (“MedPro”) and Princeton Insurance Company (acquired effective December 31, 2011), providers of healthcare malpractice insurance to physicians, dentists and other healthcare providers and healthcare facilities; National Indemnity Company’s primary group, writers of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as “Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies,” providers of commercial multi-line insurance, including workers’ compensation; Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers’ compensation solutions; and BoatU.S., a writer of insurance for owners of boats and small watercraft. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we acquired Clal U.S. Holdings, which owns GUARD Insurance Group (“GUARD”), a provider of commercial property and casualty insurance coverage to small and mid-sized businesses. Premiums earned in 2012 by our various primary insurers were $2,263 million, an increase of $514 million (29%), over 2011. The increase was primarily due to increased volume of workers’ compensation insurance from the Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies and premiums from Princeton Insurance Company and GUARD. Premium volume of certain of our other primary insurers continues to be constrained by market conditions. We have the capacity and desire to write substantially more volume when market conditions improve. In 2012, our primary insurers produced underwriting gains of $286 million, an increase of $44 million (18%) over 2011. Underwriting gains as percentages of premiums earned were approximately 13% in 2012 and 14% in 2011. Earned premiums by our primary insurance businesses in 2011 were approximately $1.7 billion, which was relatively unchanged from 2010. The underwriting gain in 2011 reflects favorable loss experience at MedPro and Applied Underwriters, including overall reductions of estimated liabilities for prior years’ losses, partially offset by increased underwriting losses of the Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies. 36 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income of our insurance operations follows. Amounts are in millions. 2012 2011 2010 Investment income before taxes and noncontrolling interests (1) $ 4,454 $ 4,725 $ 5,195 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,057 1,170 1,335 Net investment income $ 3,397 $ 3,555 $ 3,860 (1) Includes equity method earnings of $50 million in 2010 related to BNSF. Investment income consists of interest and dividends earned on cash and investments of our insurance businesses. Pre-tax investment income in 2012 declined $271 million (6%) compared to 2011. The decline reflected the redemptions in 2011 of our investments in Goldman Sachs 10% Preferred Stock (insurance subsidiaries held 87% of the $5 billion aggregate investment) and in General Electric 10% Preferred Stock ($3 billion aggregate investment). Dividends earned by our insurance subsidiaries from these investments were $420 million in 2011. Investment income in 2012 reflected increased dividends earned from our investment in Bank of America 6% Preferred Stock (insurance subsidiaries hold 80% of the $5 billion aggregate investment), which was acquired in September of 2011, and increased dividend rates with respect to several of our common stock holdings. We continue to hold significant cash and cash equivalent balances currently earning near zero yields. However, our management believes that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and strongly insists on safety over yield with respect to cash and cash equivalents. Pre-tax investment income in 2011 declined $470 million (9%) compared to 2010. Investment income in 2011 was negatively impacted by redemptions at the end of 2010 and in 2011 of certain investments we made in 2008 and 2009, including the aforementioned investments in Goldman Sachs and General Electric Preferred Stock, as well as the Swiss Re 12% capital instrument (CHF 3 billion). Our insurance subsidiaries earned dividends from these three investments of $420 million in 2011 compared with approximately $1.0 billion in 2010. In 2011, investment income was favorably impacted by increased dividend rates with respect to several of our common stock holdings. Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $73 billion at December 31, 2012, $70 billion at December 31, 2011 and $66 billion at December 31, 2010. The cost of float, as represented by the ratio of underwriting gain or loss to average float, was negative for the last three years, as our insurance business generated underwriting gains in each year. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 follows. Other investments include investments in Wrigley, Goldman Sachs, General Electric, Dow Chemical and Bank of America (See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Amounts are in millions.

Non-investment grade securities represent securities that are rated below BBB- or Baa3. Foreign government securities include obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by national or provincial government entities. Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) We acquired control of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation (“BNSF”) in February 2010, and its results are included in our consolidated results thereafter. BNSF operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states and two Canadian provinces. BNSF’s major business groups are classified by product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. Earnings of BNSF since we acquired control are summarized below, and earnings for the year ending December 31, 2010 is provided for comparison (in millions). 2012 2011 Feb. 13, 2010 –Dec. 31, 2010 2010 Revenues $ 20,835 $ 19,548 $ 15,059 $ 16,850 Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 4,505 4,315 3,562 4,004 Fuel 4,459 4,267 2,687 3,016 Purchased services 2,374 2,218 1,890 2,169 Depreciation and amortization 1,889 1,807 1,532 1,724 Equipment rents 810 779 670 767 Materials and other 798 861 672 675 Total operating expenses 14,835 14,247 11,013 12,355 Interest expense 623 560 435 507 15,458 14,807 11,448 12,862 Pre-tax earnings 5,377 4,741 3,611 3,988 Income taxes 2,005 1,769 1,376 1,529 Net earnings $ 3,372 $ 2,972 $ 2,235 $ 2,459 Revenues in 2012 were approximately $20.8 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion (7%) over 2011. Overall, the revenue increase in 2012 reflected higher average revenues per car/unit of approximately 4% as well as a 2% increase in cars/units handled (“volume”). Revenues in each period include fuel surcharges to customers under programs intended to recover incremental fuel costs when fuel prices exceed threshold fuel prices. Fuel surcharges in 2012 increased 6% over 2011, and are reflected in average revenue per car/unit. The increase in overall volume during 2012 included increases in consumer products (4%) and industrial products (13%), partially offset by declines in coal (6%) and agricultural products (3%). The consumer products volume increase was primarily 38 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) attributable to higher domestic intermodal and automotive volume. Industrial products volume increased primarily as a result of increased shipments of petroleum and construction products. The decline in coal unit volume in 2012 was attributed to lower coal demand as a result of low natural gas prices and high utility stockpiles. Agricultural product volume declined in 2012 compared to 2011, reflecting lower wheat and corn shipments for export partially offset by higher soybean and U.S. corn shipments. Operating expenses in 2012 increased $588 million (4%) compared to 2011. Compensation and benefits expenses in 2012 increased $190 million (4%) over 2011 due to the increased volume as well as wage inflation, partially offset by increased productivity and lower weather-related costs. Fuel expenses in 2012 increased $192 million (4.5%) due to higher fuel prices and increased volume, partially offset by improved fuel efficiency. Fuel efficiency in 2011 was negatively impacted by severe weather conditions. Purchased services costs in 2012 increased $156 million (7%) compared to 2011 due primarily to increased volume, increased purchased transportation services of BNSF Logistics, a wholly-owned third party logistics company, and increased equipment maintenance costs, partially offset by lower weather-related costs. Interest expense in 2012 increased $63 million (11%) versus 2011, due principally to higher average outstanding debt balances. Revenues for 2011 were approximately $19.5 billion, representing an increase of approximately $2.7 billion (16%) over 2010. Revenues from each of the four business groups increased between 8% and 19% as compared to 2010. Overall, the increases in revenues in 2011 reflected a 12% increase in average revenues per car/unit across all four business groups, as well as a 3% increase in the volume of cars/units handled. Revenues in each period include fuel surcharges. Average revenues per car/unit in 2011 included the effects of fuel surcharge increases of 35% in 2011 as compared to 2010. The volume increase in 2011 is comprised of increases of 7% in cars/units handled in the consumer products and industrial products groups combined with a 4% decrease in volume for coal products. The consumer products volume increase was attributable primarily to higher domestic intermodal and international volume. The decline in coal unit volume was partially attributable to the impacts of severe flooding along key coal routes. Industrial products volume increased primarily as a result of increased steel and sand shipments, as well as increased demand in petroleum products. Agricultural product volume remained relatively unchanged, as higher wheat exports and U.S. corn shipments were mostly offset by declining soybean exports. Operating expenses in 2011 were $14.2 billion, representing an increase of $1.9 billion (15%) over 2010. Fuel expenses increased $1.3 billion in 2011 primarily due to higher fuel prices. The remainder of the increase in fuel costs was driven by higher overall freight volumes and severe weather conditions, which negatively impacted efficiency. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $311 million, reflecting increased volume, as well as salaries and benefits inflation, increased personnel training costs and flood-related costs. Purchased services expenses increased $49 million due primarily to increased volume and flood-related costs, offset by lower locomotive maintenance costs. Materials and other expenses increased $186 million, reflecting higher locomotive and freight car material costs and increased crew transportation, travel and casualty costs offset by lower environmental costs. Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) We hold an 89.8% ownership interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (“MidAmerican”), which operates an international energy business. MidAmerican’s domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of two regulated utility companies, PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”). MidAmerican also owns two interstate natural gas pipeline companies. In Great Britain, MidAmerican operates two electricity distribution businesses, owned by Northern Powergrid Holdings Company (“Northern Powergrid”). The rates that utility and natural gas pipeline companies charge customers for energy and other services are generally subject to regulatory approval. Rates are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital. To the extent these operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, MidAmerican also operates a diversified portfolio of independent power projects, including recently-acquired solar and wind projects, and the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States. 39 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) (Continued) Revenues and earnings of MidAmerican are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 PacifiCorp $ 4,950 $ 4,639 $ 4,518 $ 737 $ 771 $ 783 MidAmerican Energy Company 3,275 3,530 3,824 236 279 279 Natural gas pipelines 978 993 994 383 388 378 Northern Powergrid 1,036 1,016 804 429 469 333 Real estate brokerage 1,333 1,007 1,046 82 39 42 Other 175 106 119 91 36 47 $ 11,747 $ 11,291 $ 11,305 Earnings before corporate interest and income taxes 1,958 1,982 1,862 Corporate interest (314 ) (336 ) (353 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (321 ) (442 ) (378 ) Earnings attributable to Berkshire $ 1,323 $ 1,204 $ 1,131 In 2012, PacifiCorp’s revenues increased $311 million (7%) over revenues in 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher retail revenues of $244 million, which were due to higher prices approved by regulators across most of PacifiCorp’s jurisdictions of $222 million, as well as to increased revenues from renewable energy credits. The comparative increase in renewable energy credit revenues in 2012 was attributable in part to higher deferrals of credits in 2011 as a result of a rate case settlement. In 2012, PacifiCorp also experienced generally higher customer load in Utah, which was offset by lower industrial customer load in Wyoming and Oregon, attributable to certain large customers electing to self-generate their own power and by lower residential customer load in Oregon as a result of unfavorable weather. PacifiCorp’s earnings before corporate interest and taxes (“EBIT”) in 2012 declined $34 million (4%) compared to the corresponding 2011 period. EBIT in 2012 reflected increased operating earnings from higher revenues (from rates and customer loads), which was more than offset by higher energy costs and other operating expenses, as well as increased depreciation and amortization from higher plant in service. In 2012, operating expenses included charges of $165 million related to litigation, fire and other damage claims. PacifiCorp’s revenues in 2011 were $4,639 million, an increase of $121 million (3%) over 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $350 million in retail operating revenues, partially offset by a decrease of $196 million in wholesale and other operating revenues. The increase in retail revenues was due to higher prices approved by regulators and higher customer load. The decrease in wholesale and other revenues was due to a 24% decrease in average prices and a 6% decrease in volumes. Additionally, wholesale and other revenues decreased $57 million due to lower sales and higher deferrals of renewable energy credits. PacifiCorp’s EBIT in 2011 was $771 million, a decrease of $12 million (2%) from 2010. Increased revenues were more than offset by an overall increase in energy and operating costs, as well as higher net interest expense. MEC’s revenues in 2012 declined $255 million (7%) compared to 2011. In 2012, MEC’s regulated electric revenues increased 2% to approximately $1.7 billion, while regulated natural gas revenues declined $110 million to $659 million. The decline in natural gas revenues reflected lower average per-unit cost of natural gas sold and lower volumes, which was attributable to unseasonably warm weather and other usage factors. Nonregulated and other operating revenues declined $178 million in 2012 compared to 2011, due to generally lower electricity and natural gas prices. MEC’s EBIT in 2012 declined $43 million (15%) compared to 2011, which reflected lower operating earnings, partially offset by lower interest expense. In 2012, MEC’s overall operating earnings reflected increased depreciation expense of $56 million and higher general and administrative expenses. MEC’s revenues of $3,530 million in 2011 declined $294 million (8%) from 2010 due to lower regulated electric and gas revenues as well as lower nonregulated and other operating revenues. Regulated retail and wholesale electric revenues declined $117 million (7%), primarily due to a 19% reduction in wholesale volume and due to lower average wholesale prices. Regulated natural gas revenues declined $83 million (10%), primarily due to a 30% decline in wholesale volume. Nonregulated and other operating revenues decreased $112 million (9%), due principally to lower electricity volumes and prices. MEC’s EBIT of $279 40 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) (Continued) million in 2011 was unchanged from 2010. The effect of the declines in revenues were essentially offset by lower energy costs, which was driven by lower sales volumes, and to a lesser degree, by lower net interest expense. In 2012, natural gas pipelines’ revenues and EBIT declined $15 million and $5 million, respectively, compared to 2011. In 2012, natural gas revenues increased from expansion projects and from higher transportation and storage rates in certain markets, which were more than offset by lower volumes of gas and condensate liquids sales (which are offset in cost of sales) and the impact of contract expirations. In 2012, EBIT also reflected increased depreciation expense, partially offset by lower interest expense. Natural gas pipelines’ revenues and EBIT in 2011 were relatively unchanged from 2010. Northern Powergrid’s revenues in 2012 increased $20 million (2%) while EBIT declined $40 million (9%) compared to 2011. In 2012, revenues were negatively impacted by currency-related declines from a stronger U.S. Dollar. Excluding currency related impacts, distribution revenues increased $28 million in 2012, reflecting higher tariff rates ($76 million), partially offset by the impact of higher regulatory provisions in 2011 ($55 million). Northern Powergrid’s EBIT in 2012 was negatively affected by increases in pension expense ($44 million) and distribution operating expenses ($21 million), which more than offset the increase in distribution revenues. Revenues of Northern Powergrid were $1,016 million in 2011, an increase of $212 million (26%) from 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $197 million in distribution revenues, and to a lesser degree to a weaker U.S. Dollar. EBIT in 2011 was $469 million, an increase of $136 million (41%) over 2010. The increase in EBIT was also primarily due to higher distribution revenues and the weaker U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the impact of a $45 million gain on the sale of a subsidiary in 2010. Real estate brokerage revenues in 2012 increased $326 million (32%) and EBIT increased $43 million (110%) over 2011. The revenue increase included $123 million from businesses acquired in 2012. The increase in revenues also reflected a 16% increase in closed sales transactions and higher average home sale prices from existing businesses. The increase in real estate brokerage EBIT in 2012 reflected the impact of business acquisitions in 2012 as well as the aforementioned increase in closed sales transactions. Revenues of the real estate brokerage business were $1,007 million in 2011, down 4% from $1,046 million in 2010, primarily due to a 4% decrease in average home sale prices. EBIT of the real estate brokerage business of $39 million was 7% lower than the $42 million in 2010. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 Marmon $ 7,171 $ 6,925 $ 5,967 $ 1,137 $ 992 $ 813 McLane Company 37,437 33,279 32,687 403 370 369 Other manufacturing 26,757 21,191 17,664 3,319 2,397 1,911 Other service 8,175 7,438 6,852 966 977 905 Retailing 3,715 3,573 3,440 306 301 276 $ 83,255 $ 72,406 $ 66,610 Pre-tax earnings 6,131 5,037 4,274 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 2,432 1,998 1,812 $ 3,699 $ 3,039 $ 2,462 41 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Marmon Through Marmon, we operate approximately 150 manufacturing and service businesses that operate independently within eleven diverse business sectors. Marmon’s revenues in 2012 were approximately $7.2 billion, an increase of 3.6% over 2011. Revenue increases attributable to bolt-on acquisitions in the Crane Services, Highway Technologies, Engineered Wire & Cable and Distribution Services sectors were substantially offset by the impact of lower copper prices in the Building Wire and Flow Products sectors. However, significant organic growth occurred within the Distribution Services, Transportation Services & Engineered Products (“TSEP”), Highway Technologies and Water Treatment sectors. Despite falling steel prices, Distribution Services increased market share in their market niches, driving annual revenues up 5% over 2011. Higher rail fleet utilization and higher rental rates, offset by lower external sales of railroad tank cars, provided most of the TSEP growth and sulfur equipment installations in the Middle East provided the balance. Commercial and heavy haul trailers have driven the increase in Highway Technologies, while projects for the Canadian Tar Sands area provided growth in Water Treatment. These increases were somewhat offset by revenue declines in the Flow Products and Building Wire sectors due to the persistent slowdown in commercial construction. Retail Store Fixtures continued to suffer from a reduction in volume from its major customer, which resulted in a 14% decline in revenues for 2012. Pre-tax earnings in 2012 were $1.1 billion, an increase of 14.6% over 2011. Approximately 25% of the overall increase in pre-tax earnings was attributable to bolt-on acquisitions. Excluding the effects of these acquisitions, eight of the eleven Marmon business sectors produced increased pre-tax earnings in 2012 compared to 2011. Among the sectors reporting the largest dollar increases in pre-tax earnings were the TSEP, Highway Technologies, Distribution Services and Water Treatment sectors reflecting the aforementioned revenue growth. In addition, Engineered Wire & Cable sector’s pre-tax earnings rose 24% attributable to restructuring actions taken in 2011 in the utility and commodity-driven businesses, along with growth in that sector’s specialty wire niches. Flow Products, Building Wire and Retail Store Fixtures sectors reported lower 2012 pre-tax earnings consistent with the revenue declines previously discussed. In 2012, consolidated pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 15.9% compared to 14.3% in 2011. The improvement in operating results in 2012 reflects the continued emphasis of Marmon’s business model, which fosters margin growth. Consistent with this model, most of the growth in 2012 was in higher margin sectors that focus on niche markets. In addition, improvements in revenues and pre-tax earnings also generally reflected continued strength in some of Marmon’s end markets, recent new product introductions and ongoing efforts to control overhead costs. Revenues in 2011 were $6.9 billion, an increase of approximately 16% over 2010. An estimated 25% of the aggregate revenue increase was attributed to increased copper prices affecting the Building Wire and Flow Products sectors, where copper cost increases are passed on to customers with little or no margin. Ten of the eleven business sectors produced comparative revenue increases. The only sector reporting a comparative revenue decrease was the Retail Store Fixtures sector, where its largest customer significantly reduced its purchases. Pre-tax earnings in 2011 were $992 million, an increase of approximately 22% over 2010. Pre-tax earnings in 2011 increased in all sectors except Retail Store Fixtures consistent with the revenue decline previously discussed. Pre-tax earnings as a percent of revenues were 14.3% in 2011 and 13.6% in 2010. McLane Company Through McLane, we operate a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. McLane’s business is marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins. McLane’s significant customers include Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven and Yum! Brands. In 2010, McLane acquired Empire Distributors (“Empire”), based in Georgia and North Carolina, and Horizon Wine and Spirits Inc. (“Horizon”), based in Tennessee. Empire and Horizon are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer. On August 24, 2012, McLane acquired Meadowbrook Meat Company, Inc. (“MBM”). MBM, based in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, is a large customized foodservice distributor for national restaurant chains with annual revenues of approximately $6 billion. MBM’s revenues and earnings were included in McLane’s results beginning as of the acquisition date. Approximately 28% of McLane’s consolidated revenues in 2012 were attributable to Wal-Mart. A curtailment of purchasing by Wal-Mart or another of its significant customers could have a material adverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. McLane’s revenues were approximately $37.4 billion in 2012, an increase of about $4.2 billion (12.5%) over 2011. The increase in revenues was attributable to the MBM acquisition, as well as 6% to 8% revenue increases in McLane’s grocery, 42 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) McLane Company (Continued) foodservice and beverage business units. The increases in grocery and foodservice revenues reflected manufacturer price increases as well as increased volume. Pre-tax earnings in 2012 were $403 million, an increase of $33 million (9%) over 2011. The overall increase in earnings reflected the increases in revenues as pre-tax margin rates were relatively unchanged. McLane’s revenues of $33.3 billion in 2011 increased approximately $600 million (2%) over 2010. The increase in revenues in 2011 was partially attributable to the inclusion of the full-year results of Empire and Horizon. Otherwise, revenues in 2011 from the grocery business were relatively unchanged from 2010, while revenues from the foodservice business increased approximately 7% over 2010. Pre-tax earnings in 2011 were essentially unchanged from 2010 which reflected the inclusion of Empire and Horizon and increased earnings from the grocery business, offset by lower earnings from the foodservice business. In 2011, McLane benefitted from a slight increase in its consolidated gross sales margin, which was offset by increased fuel, trucking and legal and professional costs. Other manufacturing Our other manufacturing businesses include several manufacturers of building products (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville, Shaw and MiTek) and apparel (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes Russell athletic apparel and Vanity Fair Brands women’s intimate apparel). Also included in this group are Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehicles, IMC Metalworking Companies (“Iscar”), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide and CTB, a manufacturer of equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries. Other manufacturing businesses also include The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”), a specialty chemical manufacturer that we acquired on September 16, 2011. Lubrizol’s revenues and earnings are included in other manufacturing revenues and earnings beginning as of that date. Revenues of our other manufacturing businesses in 2012 were approximately $26.8 billion, an increase of approximately $5.6 billion (26%) over 2011. Excluding Lubrizol, revenues in 2012 grew 6% over 2011. In 2012, we experienced a revenue increase of 27% from Forest River, which was attributable to increased volume and average sales prices. In 2012, revenues from building products and apparel increased 4% and 5%, respectively, as compared with 2011. However, revenues in 2012 of Iscar and CTB (before the impact of bolt-on acquisitions) declined compared to 2011 as a result of weakness in demand, particularly in non-U.S. markets. In 2012, pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses were approximately $3.3 billion, an increase of $922 million (38%) over earnings in 2011. Excluding the impact of Lubrizol, earnings of our other manufacturing businesses in 2012 increased 6% compared to 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to increased earnings from building products, apparel and Forest River, partially offset by lower earnings from Iscar, CTB and Scott Fetzer. In 2012, our Shaw carpet and flooring business benefited from the impact of price increases at the end of 2011 and beginning of 2012, as well as from relatively stable raw material costs in 2012, that resulted in higher margins. Our apparel businesses benefitted from past pricing actions and stabilizing raw material costs. On the other hand, our other businesses that manufacture products that are primarily for commercial and industrial customers, particularly those with significant business in overseas markets, such as CTB and Iscar, were negatively impacted in 2012 by slowing economic conditions in certain of those markets. Other manufacturing revenues increased $3.5 billion (20%) in 2011 to $21.2 billion compared with 2010. In 2011, Lubrizol accounted for approximately $1.7 billion of the increase. Otherwise, revenues of our other manufacturing businesses increased 10%. Iscar and CTB in particular experienced strong demand for their products. Pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses were $2.4 billion in 2011, an increase of $486 million (25%) over 2010. Excluding the impact of Lubrizol, earnings increased 10% compared to 2010. Increased earnings were generated by Iscar and CTB, which were partially offset by lower earnings of the apparel group and, particularly from the Fruit of the Loom group of businesses, which were negatively impacted by significantly higher cotton costs. Our building products businesses were negatively impacted by slow residential housing construction activity. 43 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Other service Our other service businesses include NetJets, the world’s leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft. Among the other businesses included in this group are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor; Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings; Dairy Queen, which licenses and services a system of over 6,200 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; Buffalo News and the BH Media Group, which includes the Omaha World-Herald acquired at the end of 2011, as well as 26 other daily newspapers and numerous other publications; and businesses that provide management and other services to insurance companies. Revenues of our other service businesses in 2012 were approximately $8.2 billion, an increase of $737 million (10%) over 2011. The increase in revenues in 2012 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the BH Media Group and a comparative revenue increase from TTI, principally due to its bolt-on business acquisitions in 2012. Pre-tax earnings of $966 million in 2012 declined $11 million (1%) from earnings in 2011. Earnings of NetJets and FlightSafety in 2012 were relatively unchanged from 2011. Earnings of other service businesses in 2012 included earnings of the BH Media Group, which were more than offset by lower earnings from TTI due primarily to weaker customer demand and intensifying price competition over the past year. Revenues of our other service businesses were approximately $7.4 billion in 2011, an increase of $586 million (9%) over 2010. The revenue increase was primarily attributable to stronger demand for electronic components (TTI) and pilot training (FlightSafety) and from higher revenues at NetJets. TTI revenues increased 12% as customer demand increased rapidly during the first half of 2011, and then moderated over the second half. FlightSafety’s revenues increased approximately 8% due primarily to increases in training demand within the business aviation and regional airline markets, partially offset by lower revenues from government customers. The comparative revenue increases of NetJets reflected revenues related to aircraft operating cost increases that are passed through to customers (with little or no margin), and slight increases in rates. Revenue hours flown in 2011 were essentially unchanged from 2010. Pre-tax earnings were $977 million in 2011, which exceeded 2010 by $72 million (8%). The increase in earnings was driven by higher earnings of FlightSafety, NetJets and TTI, partially offset by lower earnings from Buffalo News. FlightSafety’s earnings increased approximately 16%, reflecting increased revenues and ongoing cost containment efforts. NetJets’ earnings increased 10% primarily attributable to higher revenues and lower aircraft maintenance costs due to a 10% reduction in the size of the fleet, partially offset by comparatively higher impairment charges related to the planned disposition of certain aircraft and fees incurred to cancel certain aircraft purchase commitments. Over the past few years, NetJets has reduced the number of aircraft in its fleet by approximately 20% and lowered its operating cost structure to better match customer demand. Retailing Our retailing operations consist of four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies; Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools; and Oriental Trading Company (“OTC”), a direct retailer of party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties, which we acquired on November 27, 2012. Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2012 from the retailing businesses increased $142 million (4%) and $5 million (2%), respectively, over revenues and earnings in 2011. Increased revenues from the home furnishings and jewelry businesses as well as the inclusion of OTC since November 27 were partially offset by lower revenues from Pampered Chef. Increased earnings of our home furnishings retailers were substantially offset by lower earnings from our jewelry businesses and Pampered Chef. Revenues of our retailing businesses were $3.6 billion in 2011, an increase of $133 million (4%) over 2010. Pre-tax earnings were $301 million, an increase of $25 million (9%) over 2010. With the exception of Pampered Chef, each of our retailing businesses generated comparatively higher revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2011. 44 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Finance and Financial Products Our finance and financial products businesses include manufactured housing and finance (Clayton Homes), transportation equipment leasing (XTRA), furniture leasing (CORT) as well as various miscellaneous financing activities. A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 Manufactured housing and finance $ 3,014 $ 2,932 $ 3,256 $ 255 $ 154 $ 176 Furniture/transportation equipment leasing 753 739 660 148 155 53 Other 343 343 348 445 465 460 $ 4,110 $ 4,014 $ 4,264 Pre-tax earnings 848 774 689 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 291 258 248 $ 557 $ 516 $ 441 Clayton Homes’ revenues in 2012 increased $82 million (3%) over 2011. Revenues from home sales increased $129 million (9%), due primarily to a 14% increase in units sold partially offset by slightly lower average selling prices. Financial services revenues declined $47 million (3%) as a result of lower interest income. Installment loan and finance receivable balances as of December 31, 2012, were approximately $12.3 billion, a decline of approximately $550 million from December 31, 2011. Clayton Homes’ pre-tax earnings in 2012 increased $101 million (66%) over earnings in 2011. Earnings in 2012 were impacted by the increased unit sales which improved manufacturing and other operating efficiencies. Earnings also benefited from reduced insurance claims and a decline in credit losses. The decline in interest income on loan portfolios was more than offset by interest expense attributable to a decline in borrowings and lower interest rates. Revenues of Clayton Homes were $2.9 billion in 2011, a decline of $324 million (10%) from 2010. Revenues from home sales declined approximately 17%, as unit sales declined about 14%. Home sales in 2010 benefitted from the U.S. federal tax credit program offered to homebuyers, which expired on June 30, 2010. In addition, the average price per home sold declined slightly in 2011, as a larger percentage of homes sold were lower priced single section units. Clayton Homes’ financial services income in 2011 also declined slightly, due primarily to lower interest income from installment loans. Net consumer loan balances at December 31, 2011 declined by approximately $600 million from December 31, 2010 to approximately $12.9 billion. The decline reflects runoff of the loan portfolio and fewer new loans. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $154 million in 2011, a decline of $22 million (12.5%) versus 2010. Earnings in 2011 were negatively impacted by lower revenues and a $27 million increase in insurance claims (primarily from severe storms in the spring and summer), partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative and interest expenses. While manufactured homes sold were higher in 2012 compared to 2011, Clayton Homes’ manufactured housing business continues to operate at a competitive disadvantage compared to traditional single family housing markets, which receive significant interest rate subsidies from the U.S. government through government agency insured mortgages. For the most part, these subsidies are not available to factory built homes. Nevertheless, Clayton Homes remains the largest manufactured housing business in the United States and we believe that it will continue to operate profitably, even under the prevailing conditions. In 2012, revenues of CORT and XTRA increased $14 million (2%), while pre-tax earnings declined $7 million (5%) versus 2011. In 2012, CORT’s earnings increased over 2011 due to a 5% increase in rental income and relatively stable selling, general and administrative expenses, which improved operating margins. In 2012, earnings from XTRA declined primarily due to increased depreciation expense and lower foreign currency exchange gains. Revenues of CORT and XTRA increased $79 million in 2011 compared to 2010, while earnings increased $102 million. The increases in revenues and earnings were primarily attributable to an increased proportion of assets on lease (utilization rates) and lower depreciation expense. A significant portion of the expenses of our leasing businesses, such as depreciation and facilities expenses, do not change significantly with rental volume, so the impact of revenue changes can have a disproportionate impact on earnings. 45 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Finance and Financial Products (Continued) Earnings from our other finance business activities include investment income from a portfolio of fixed maturity and equity investments, a commercial mortgage servicing business in which we own 50% and from a small portfolio of long-held commercial real estate loans, which during the third and fourth quarters of 2012 were repaid in full. In addition, other earnings include income from interest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes on borrowings (approximately $11.2 billion as of December 31, 2012) by a Berkshire financing subsidiary. The borrowings are used to fund loans to Clayton Homes. Corresponding charges for this interest spread (approximately $90 million in 2012, $100 million in 2011 and $110 million in 2010) are reflected in Clayton Homes’ earnings. In addition, other earnings include guaranty fee income of $30 million in 2012, $41 million in 2011 and $38 million in 2010 from NetJets. Corresponding expenses are included in NetJets’ results. Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows. Amounts are in millions. 2012 2011 2010 Investment gains/losses: Sales and other disposals Insurance and other $ 1,288 $ 1,991 $ 3,032 Finance and financial products 2 162 9 Other-than-temporary impairment losses (337 ) (908 ) (1,973 ) Other 509 29 1,017 1,462 1,274 2,085 Derivative gains/losses: Credit default contracts 894 (251 ) 250 Equity index put option contracts 997 (1,787 ) 172 Other derivative contracts 72 (66 ) (161 ) 1,963 (2,104 ) 261 Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 3,425 (830 ) 2,346 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,198 (309 ) 472 Net gains/losses $ 2,227 $ (521 ) $ 1,874 Investment gains/losses arise primarily from the sale or redemption of investments. The timing of gains or losses from sales or redemptions can have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses usually have minimal impact on the periodic changes in our consolidated shareholders’ equity since most of our investments are regularly recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical or predictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will have on our reported earnings. Although our management does not consider investment gains and losses in a given period as necessarily meaningful or useful in evaluating periodic earnings, we are providing information to explain the nature of such gains and losses when they are reflected in earnings. Pre-tax investment gains from sales and other disposals of investments were approximately $1.3 billion in 2012 and were primarily attributable to sales of equity securities. Investment gains from sales and other disposals in 2011 included an aggregate pre-tax gain of $1.8 billion from the redemptions of our Goldman Sachs and General Electric preferred stock investments. In 2010, investment gains from sales and other disposals were derived principally from dispositions of equity securities and a $1.3 billion gain from the redemption of the Swiss Re capital instrument. Other investment gains in 2010 included a one-time holding gain of $979 million that arose in connection with our acquisition of BNSF as a result of the application of acquisition accounting under GAAP. 46 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) In each of the three years ending December 31, 2012, we recognized OTTI losses on certain of our equity and fixed maturity investments. OTTI losses on fixed maturity investments were $337 million in 2012, $402 million in 2011 and $1,020 million in 2010. In each year, substantially all of the losses related to our investments in Texas Competitive Electric Holdings (“TCEH”) bonds. In each year, we recognized losses after reevaluating expected cash flows likely to be received. While we do not currently anticipate further OTTI losses on our TCEH investments, additional losses may be required in the future if the company’s financial condition deteriorates further or it pursues bankruptcy reorganization. In 2011 and 2010, we also recognized aggregate OTTI losses of $506 million and $953 million, respectively, related to our investments in equity securities. Such OTTI losses in 2011 and 2010 averaged about 7.5% and 20%, respectively, of the original cost of the impaired securities. In each case, the issuer had been profitable in recent periods and in some cases highly profitable. In 2011, a portion of the OTTI losses related to certain components of our Wells Fargo common stock investments. Although we have periodically recorded OTTI losses in earnings in each of the past three years, we continue to hold positions in certain of the related securities. In cases where the market values of these investments have increased since the dates the OTTI losses were recorded in earnings, these increases are not reflected in earnings but are instead included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. When recorded, OTTI losses have no impact whatsoever on the asset values otherwise recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets or on our consolidated shareholders’ equity. In addition, the recognition of such losses in earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income does not necessarily indicate that sales are imminent or planned and sales ultimately may not occur for a number of years. Furthermore, the recognition of OTTI losses does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is permanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost. As of December 31, 2012, unrealized losses on our investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (determined on an individual purchase lot basis) were $257 million. We consider several factors in determining whether or not impairments are deemed to be other than temporary, including the current and expected long-term business prospects and if applicable, the creditworthiness of the issuer, our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers and the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline. Security prices may remain below cost for a period of time that may be deemed excessive from the standpoint of interpreting existing accounting rules, even though other factors suggest that the prices will eventually recover. As a result, accounting regulations may require that we recognize OTTI losses in earnings in instances where we may strongly believe that the market price of the impaired security will recover to at least our original cost and where we possess the ability and intent to hold the security until, at least, that time. Derivative gains/losses primarily represent the changes in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contracts. Periodic changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying credit and equity markets. We have not actively traded into and out of credit default and equity index put option contracts. Under many of the contracts, no settlements will occur until the contract expiration dates, which may occur many years from now. In 2012, we recorded pre-tax gains from derivative contracts of approximately $2.0 billion, which included gains from our equity index put option contracts of approximately $1.0 billion. The gains from equity index put option contracts were due to increased index values, foreign currency exchange rate changes and valuation adjustments on a small number of contracts where contractual settlements are determined differently than the standard determination of intrinsic value, partially offset by lower interest rate assumptions. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our remaining equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates, which begin in 2018, based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts as of those dates. Our recorded liability for these contracts was approximately $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2012. In 2011, we recorded pre-tax losses of approximately $1.8 billion on our equity index put option contracts. The losses reflected declines ranging from about 5.5% to 17% with respect to three of the four equity indexes covered under our contracts and lower interest rate assumptions. In 2010, gains on equity index put option contracts were $172 million. In 2010, we settled certain equity index put option contracts early at the request of the counterparty and recorded a gain of $561 million, which is the difference between the recorded fair values of these contracts at the beginning of 2010 and the settlement payment amounts. Otherwise, we recognized pre-tax losses of $389 million under our remaining equity index put option contracts reflecting generally lower interest rate assumptions and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes. There were no new equity contracts entered into or other settlements during the three year period ending December 31, 2012. 47 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) In 2012, we recognized pre-tax gains of $894 million on credit default contracts. Such gains were attributable to narrower spreads and the passage of time (reduced time exposure), as well as from settlements of certain contracts. No new credit default contracts were written during the past three years. A significant portion of our risks related to non-investment grade corporate issuers expired in the fourth quarter of 2012, and all remaining exposures related to corporate issuers expire in 2013. We recorded pre-tax losses of $251 million on our credit default contracts in 2011 and gains of $250 million in 2010. The losses in 2011 were primarily related to our contracts involving non-investment grade corporate issuers due to widening credit default spreads and loss events. The gains in 2010 reflected the overall narrowing of credit default spreads for corporate issuers and were somewhat offset by losses due to the widening of spreads for municipalities. Financial Condition Our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2012 was $187.6 billion, an increase of $22.8 billion from December 31, 2011. Consolidated cash and investments of our insurance and other businesses approximated $176.3 billion at December 31, 2012 including cash and cash equivalents of $42.4 billion, of which about $10.6 billion was held by the parent company. Otherwise, invested assets are held predominantly in our insurance businesses. On January 31, 2012, we issued $1.7 billion of parent company senior unsecured notes, the proceeds of which were used to fund the repayment of $1.7 billion of notes that matured in February 2012. In January 2013, we issued $2.6 billion of parent company senior unsecured notes with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2043, the proceeds of which were used to fund the repayment of $2.6 billion of notes that matured in February 2013. In September 2011, our Board of Directors authorized Berkshire Hathaway to repurchase Class A and Class B shares of Berkshire at prices no higher than a 10% premium over the book value of the shares. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Board of Directors increased the 10% premium limitation to 20%. Berkshire may repurchase shares at management’s discretion. The repurchase program is expected to continue indefinitely, but does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares. Repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In December 2012, Berkshire acquired 9,475 Class A shares and 606,499 Class B shares for approximately $1.3 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we acquired 10% of the outstanding shares of Marmon held by noncontrolling interests for aggregate consideration of approximately $1.4 billion. Approximately $800 million of the consideration was paid in the fourth quarter, and the remainder is payable in March 2013. As a result of these acquisitions, our ownership interest in Marmon increased to approximately 90%. As discussed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on February 13, 2013, we committed to invest $12.12 billion in a newly formed holding company that entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire H.J. Heinz Company (“Heinz”). Our investment will consist of common and preferred stock and we will hold 50% of the voting interests in the holding company. The acquisition of Heinz is subject to approval by Heinz shareholders, receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2013. We expect to use cash on hand to fund our investments. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and MidAmerican) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make capital expenditures in the normal course of business. In 2012, MidAmerican’s capital expenditures were $3.4 billion and BNSF’s capital expenditures were $3.5 billion. BNSF and MidAmerican forecast aggregate capital expenditures of approximately $8.3 billion in 2013. Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded from cash flows from operations and debt issuances. In 2012, BNSF issued debt of $2.5 billion with maturities in 2022 and 2042, and its outstanding debt increased approximately $1.9 billion to $14.5 billion as of December 31, 2012. In 2012, MidAmerican issued or acquired new term debt of approximately $3.1 billion and its aggregate outstanding borrowings increased approximately $1.7 billion to $21.6 billion as of December 31, 2012. BNSF and MidAmerican have aggregate debt and capital lease maturities in 2013 of about $2.5 billion. Berkshire has committed until February 28, 2014 to provide up to $2 billion of additional capital to MidAmerican to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund its regulated utility subsidiaries. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, MidAmerican or any of their subsidiaries. 48 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) Assets of the finance and financial products businesses, which consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other fixed maturity and equity investments, were approximately $25.4 billion as of December 31, 2012 and $25.0 billion at December 31, 2011. Liabilities were approximately $22.1 billion as of December 31, 2012 and $25.4 billion as of December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2012, notes payable and other borrowings of finance businesses were $13.0 billion and included approximately $11.2 billion of notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). In 2012, $2.7 billion of BHFC notes matured. In May and September 2012, BHFC issued $2.35 billion of new notes with maturities in 2017, 2022 and 2042. In 2013, $3.45 billion of BHFC notes will mature, including $500 million that matured in January 2013. BHFC issued new debt of $500 million in January 2013 with maturities in 2017 and 2022. We currently intend to issue additional new debt through BHFC to replace some or all of the upcoming debt maturities. The proceeds from the BHFC notes are used to finance originated and acquired loans of Clayton Homes. The full and timely payment of principal and interest on the BHFC notes is guaranteed by Berkshire. We regularly access the credit markets, particularly through our railroad, utilities and energy and finance and financial products businesses. Restricted access to credit markets at affordable rates in the future could have a significant negative impact on our operations. We are party to several equity index put option and credit default contracts as described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. With limited exception, these contracts contain no collateral posting requirements under any circumstances, including changes in either the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts or a downgrade in Berkshire’s credit ratings. Substantially all of these contracts were entered into prior to December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2012, the net liabilities recorded for such contracts were approximately $7.9 billion and our collateral posting requirements were $40 million. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law financial regulatory reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Reform Act”). The Reform Act reshapes financial regulations in the United States by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and market participants and providing new enforcement powers to regulators. Virtually all major areas of the Reform Act are subject to extensive rulemaking proceedings being conducted both jointly and independently by multiple regulatory agencies, some of which have been completed and others that are expected to be finalized in 2013. Although the Reform Act may adversely affect some of our business activities, it is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, which are not currently reflected in the financial statements, such as minimum rentals under operating leases. Such obligations will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date. The timing and/or amount of the payments under certain contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table that follows. Most significantly, the timing and amount of payments arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of claim settlement activities or events that may occur over many years. In addition, obligations arising under life, annuity and health insurance benefits are estimated based on assumptions as to future premium payments, allowances, mortality, morbidity, expenses and policy lapse rates. The amounts presented in the following table are based on the liability estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012. Although certain insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and 49 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Contractual Obligations (Continued) life, annuity and health benefits are ceded to and receivable from others under reinsurance contracts, such receivables are not reflected in the table below. A summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 follows. Amounts are in millions. Estimated payments due by period Total 2013 2014-2015 2016-2017 After 2017 Notes payable and other borrowings (1) $ 96,497 $ 13,070 $ 13,554 $ 9,935 $ 59,938 Operating leases 8,627 1,186 1,990 1,557 3,894 Purchase obligations 38,702 13,096 9,508 5,500 10,598 Losses and loss adjustment expenses (2) 66,189 14,086 15,656 9,145 27,302 Life, annuity and health insurance benefits (3) 19,600 1,516 55 225 17,804 Other (4) 34,263 15,345 3,115 1,250 14,553 Total $ 263,878 $ 58,299 $ 43,878 $ 27,612 $ 134,089 (1) Includes interest. (2) Before reserve discounts of $1,990 million. (3) Amounts represent estimated undiscounted benefit obligations net of estimated future premiums. (4) Includes commitment to invest in Heinz and derivative contract liabilities. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates are necessarily based on assumptions about numerous factors involving varying, and possibly significant, degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements, with the benefit of hindsight, will likely be adjusted in the future based on additional information made available and changes in other facts and circumstances. Property and casualty losses A summary of our consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Except for certain workers’ compensation liabilities, all liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as “gross unpaid losses”) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value, regardless of the length of the claim-tail. Amounts are in millions. Gross unpaid losses Net unpaid losses * Dec. 31, 2012 Dec. 31, 2011 Dec. 31, 2012 Dec. 31, 2011 GEICO $ 10,300 $ 10,167 $ 9,791 $ 9,705 General Re 15,961 16,288 14,740 15,267 BHRG 31,186 31,489 26,328 26,413 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 6,713 5,875 6,171 5,442 Total $ 64,160 $ 63,819 $ 57,030 $ 56,827 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges on reinsurance assumed and before foreign currency translation effects. We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts with respect to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of loss payments is subject to a great degree of variability and is contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the determination of the ultimate loss amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used in establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses. Regardless of the techniques used, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amounts payable in the future. As a result, uncertainties are imbedded in and permeate the actuarial loss reserving techniques and processes used. 50 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) As of any balance sheet date, not all claims that have occurred have been reported and not all reported claims have been settled. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include provisions for reported claims (referred to as “case reserves”) and for claims that have not been reported (referred to as incurred but not yet reported (“IBNR”) reserves). The time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement payment date is referred to as the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within a few years of occurrence. Casualty losses usually have very long claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations. The legal environment further contributes to extending claim-tails. Receivables are recorded with respect to losses ceded to other reinsurers and are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses. In addition, reinsurance receivables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders. We utilize processes and techniques to establish liability estimates that are believed to best fit the particular business. Additional information regarding those processes and techniques of our significant insurance businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows. GEICO GEICO’s gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities as of December 31, 2012 were $10.3 billion, which included $7.5 billion of reported average, case and case development reserves and $2.8 billion of IBNR reserves. GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. Auto insurance claims generally have a relatively short claim-tail. The key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). Our reserving methodologies produce reserve estimates based upon the individual claims (or a “ground-up” approach), which yields an aggregate estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Ranges of loss estimates are not determined in the aggregate. Our actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserves using recognized standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The significant reserve components (and percentage of gross reserves as of December 31, 2012) are: (1) average reserves (15%), (2) case and case development reserves (60%) and (3) IBNR reserves (25%). Each component of loss reserves is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. Reserves are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, rated state, reporting date and occurrence date, among other ways. A brief discussion of each reserve component follows. We establish average reserve amounts for reported auto damage claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. The average reserves are intended to represent a reasonable estimate for incurred claims for claims when adjusters have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that are paid within a relatively short time after being reported. Average reserve amounts are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened. Our claims adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as soon as the specific facts and merits of each claim can be evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised as more information becomes known. For most liability coverages, case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim-tail, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is established. Therefore, we establish additional case development reserve estimates, which are usually percentages of the case reserve. As of December 31, 2012, case development reserves averaged approximately 25% of total established case reserves. In 51 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) general, case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves. Case development factors are reviewed and revised periodically. For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts in order to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are subtracted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established through the collaborative effort of actuarial, claims and other management personnel. For each significant coverage, we test the adequacy of the total loss reserves using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense estimates recorded at the end of 2011 developed downward by $736 million when reevaluated through December 31, 2012, producing a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2012. These downward reserve developments represented approximately 4.4% of earned premiums in 2012 and approximately 7.2% of prior year-end recorded liabilities. Reserving assumptions at December 31, 2012 were modified appropriately to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future reserve development will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated. Within the automobile line of business, reserves for liability coverages are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails. Approximately 92% of GEICO’s reserves as of December 31, 2012 were for automobile liability, of which bodily injury (“BI”) coverage accounted for approximately 55%. We believe it is reasonably possible that the average BI severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used. If actual BI severity changes one percentage point from what was used in establishing the reserves, our reserves would develop up or down by approximately $154 million resulting in a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to be different from expected would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. GEICO’s exposure to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining liabilities associated with such exposure are currently a relatively insignificant component of GEICO’s total reserves (approximately 1.5%) and there is minimal apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure. Related claim activity over the past year was insignificant. General Re and BHRG Liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses of our General Re and BHRG underwriting units derive primarily from assumed reinsurance. Additional uncertainties are unique to the processes used in estimating such reinsurance liabilities. The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which are affected by market conditions and practices) and other factors. Contract terms and conditions tend to lack standardization and contract terms, conditions and coverages may evolve more rapidly than under primary insurance policies. We are unable to reliably measure the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainties. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative, per occurrence excess or retroactive contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract. This occurs when our personnel either works closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manages the claims themselves. However, loss information related to aggregate excess-of-loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Occasionally, loss information is reported in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is usually provided through periodic reports and may include the amount of ceded losses paid where reimbursement is sought as well as case loss reserve estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers. 52 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re and BHRG (Continued) Each of our reinsurance businesses has established practices to identify and gather needed information from clients. These practices include, for example, comparison of expected premiums to reported premiums to help identify delinquent client reports and claim reviews to facilitate loss reporting and identify inaccurate or incomplete claim reporting. We periodically evaluate and modify these practices as conditions, risk factors and unanticipated areas of exposures are identified. The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is typically delayed in comparison with claim reporting to primary insurers. In some instances, multiple reinsurers assume and cede parts of an underlying risk thereby causing multiple contractual intermediaries between us and the primary insured. In these instances, the claim reporting delays are compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer varies depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms and other factors. Contracts covering casualty losses on a per occurrence excess basis may experience longer delays in reporting due to the length of the claim-tail as regards to the underlying claim. In addition, ceding companies may not report claims until they conclude it is reasonably possible that the reinsurer will be affected, usually determined as a function of its estimate of the claim amount as a percentage of the reinsurance contract retention. However, the timing of reporting large per occurrence excess property losses or property catastrophe losses may not vary significantly from primary insurance. Under contracts where periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies, such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals which in the U.S. range from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. Outside the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices vary. In certain countries, clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. The different client reporting practices generally do not result in a significant increase in risk or uncertainty as the actuarial reserving methodologies are adjusted to compensate for the delays. Premium and loss data is provided to us through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data provided is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Generally, we are permitted under the contracts to access the cedant’s books and records with respect to the subject business, thus providing us the ability to conduct audits to determine the accuracy and completeness of information. Audits are conducted as we deem appropriate. In the normal course of business, disputes with clients occasionally arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through the involvement of our claims department personnel and the appropriate client personnel or through independent outside counsel. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or alternative dispute resolution process will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. General Re General Re’s gross and net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and gross reserves by major line of business as of December 31, 2012 are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Type Line of business Reported case reserves $ 8,258 Workers’ compensation (1) $ 2,887 IBNR reserves 7,703 Mass tort-asbestos/environmental 1,598 Gross reserves 15,961 Auto liability 3,349 Ceded reserves and deferred charges (1,221 ) Other casualty (2) 2,765 Net reserves $ 14,740 Other general liability 2,590 Property 2,772 Total $ 15,961 (1) Net of discounts of $1,990 million. (2) Includes directors and officers, errors and omissions, medical malpractice and umbrella coverage. 53 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) General Re’s loss reserve estimation process is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (“ACRs”) and IBNR reserves. The critical processes in establishing loss reserves involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the determination of expected ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and the comparison of case reserve reporting trends to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded reserve amounts are subject to “tail risk” where reported losses develop beyond the maximum expected loss emergence time period. We do not routinely determine loss reserve ranges. We believe that the techniques necessary to make such determinations have not sufficiently developed and that the myriad of assumptions required render such resulting ranges to be unreliable. In addition, claim counts or average amounts per claim are not utilized because clients do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail. Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, our claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners’ estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners’ estimates are significantly greater than the ceding company’s estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACRs are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2012, ACRs aggregated approximately $2.5 billion before discounts and were concentrated in workers’ compensation reserves, and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. Our examiners also periodically conduct detailed claim reviews of individual clients and case reserves are often increased as a result. In 2012, we conducted 270 claim reviews. Our actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (“reserve cells”) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative and program) and line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, etc.). For each reserve cell, premiums and losses are aggregated by accident year, policy year or underwriting year (depending on client reporting practices) and analyzed over time. We internally refer to these loss aggregations as loss triangles, which serve as the primary basis for our IBNR reserve calculations. We review over 300 reserve cells for our North American business and approximately 900 reserve cells with respect to our international business. We use loss triangles to determine the expected case loss emergence patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, loss triangles are further used to determine IBNR reserves. While additional calculations form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern, the determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly a mechanical process. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, we use estimation formulas along with reliance on other loss triangles and judgment. Factors affecting our loss development triangles include but are not limited to the following: changes in client claims practices, changes in claim examiners’ use of ACRs or the frequency of client company claim reviews, changes in policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. Collectively, these factors influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns. We select expected loss ratios by reserve cell, by accident year, based upon reviewing forecasted losses and indicated ultimate loss ratios that are predicted from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premium. If the selected emergence pattern is not accurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios may not be accurate, which can affect the selected loss ratios and hence the IBNR reserve. As with selected loss emergence patterns, selecting expected loss ratios is not a strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing loss ratios. We estimate IBNR reserves by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, our actuaries calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year. These calculations do not involve new assumptions and use the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year. 54 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) In 2012, our reported claims for prior years’ workers’ compensation losses were less than expected by $192 million. However, further analysis of the workers’ compensation reserve cells by segment indicated the need for maintaining IBNR reserves. These developments precipitated a net increase of $118 million in nominal IBNR reserve estimates for unreported occurrences. After adjusting for the $142 million net increase in liabilities from changes in net reserve discounts during the year, the net increase in workers’ compensation losses from prior years’ occurrences reduced pre-tax earnings in 2012 by $68 million. To illustrate the sensitivity of changes in expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios for our significant excess-of-loss workers’ compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves as of December 31, 2012 of approximately $776 million and $411 million on a discounted basis. The increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates. Our other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) developed downward in 2012 relative to expectations. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given year means that loss reserve amounts currently established will continue to develop favorably. For our significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells (including medical malpractice, umbrella, auto and general liability), an increase of five points in the tails of the expected emergence patterns and an increase of five percent in expected loss ratios (one percent for large international proportional reserve cells) would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $943 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $943 million. Overall, our property losses were lower than expected in 2012 as a result of fewer catastrophe losses during the year. Our reported claims for prior years’ property losses were less than expected by $402 million from December 31, 2011. However, the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses. In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (“D&O and E&O”) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected emergence patterns. These cells often involve a spike in loss activity arising from recent industry developments making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern. For our large D&O and E&O reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern (for those cells where emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $173 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates. Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, “mass tort”) claims. Gross unpaid mass tort liabilities at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were approximately $1.6 billion. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, mass tort liabilities, net of reinsurance, were approximately $1.2 billion. Mass tort net claims paid were $79 million in 2012. In 2012, ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims were increased by $37 million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider “survival ratios” based on net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. The survival ratio based on claim payments made over the last three years was approximately 15 years as of December 31, 2012. The reinsurance industry’s survival ratio for asbestos and pollution reserves was approximately 8.8 years based on the three years ending December 31, 2011. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. 55 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG BHRG’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2012 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions. Property Casualty Total Reported case reserves $ 1,962 $ 3,365 $ 5,327 IBNR reserves 2,824 5,044 7,868 Retroactive — 17,991 17,991 Gross reserves $ 4,786 $ 26,400 31,186 Deferred charges and ceded reserves (4,858 ) Net reserves $ 26,328 In general, the methodologies we use to establish loss reserves vary widely and encompass many of the common methodologies employed in the actuarial field today. Certain traditional methodologies such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques are utilized, as well as ground-up techniques where appropriate. Additional judgments must also be employed to consider changes in contract conditions and terms as well as the incidence of litigation or legal and regulatory change. As of December 31, 2012, our gross loss reserves related to retroactive reinsurance policies were predominately for casualty or liability losses. Our retroactive policies include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses (relating to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date) above a contractual retention are indemnified or contracts that indemnify all losses paid by the counterparty after the policy effective date. We paid retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses of approximately $1.6 billion in 2012. The classification “reported case reserves” has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since the amount is often derived from reports in bulk from ceding companies, who may have inconsistent definitions of “case reserves.” We review and establish loss reserve estimates, including estimates of IBNR reserves, in the aggregate by contract. In establishing retroactive reinsurance reserves, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. We assign judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, we reassess expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process. In 2012, changes in retroactive reserves related to contracts written in prior years were not significant. BHRG’s liabilities for environmental, asbestos and latent injury losses and loss adjustment expenses were approximately $12.4 billion at December 31, 2012 and $12.3 billion at December 31, 2011 and were concentrated within retroactive reinsurance contracts. We paid losses in 2012 attributable to these exposures of approximately $862 million. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not receive consistently reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, we conduct a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data of the reinsured to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, our estimates can only be developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. Potential legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on establishing loss reserves for mass tort claims in the future. The maximum losses payable under our retroactive policies is not expected to exceed approximately $35 billion as of December 31, 2012, which is based on aggregate contract limits applicable to most of the contracts. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we currently believe it unlikely that gross unpaid losses as of December 31, 2012 ($18.0 billion) will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15%. 56 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG (Continued) A significant number of our reinsurance contracts are expected to have a low frequency of claim occurrence combined with a potential for high severity of claims. These include property losses from catastrophes and aviation risks under catastrophe and individual risk contracts. Loss reserves related to catastrophe and individual risk contracts were approximately $1.6 billion at December 31, 2012, a decrease of about $400 million from December 31, 2011. In 2012, changes in estimated losses for prior years’ events had an insignificant effect on pre-tax earnings. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Catastrophe loss reserves are provided when it is probable that an insured loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event. Other reinsurance reserve amounts are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on an individual contract basis, supplemented by management’s judgment of the impact on each contract of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon management’s judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding company’s loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared. Derivative contract liabilities Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant amounts of derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. As of December 31, 2012 our most significant derivative contract exposures relate to equity index put option contracts written between 2004 and 2008. These contracts were entered into in over-the-counter markets and certain elements in the terms and conditions of such contracts are not standard. In particular, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. Furthermore, there is no source of independent data available to us showing trading volume and actual prices of completed transactions. As a result, the values of these liabilities are based on valuation models that are believed to be used by market participants. Such models or other valuation techniques may use inputs that are observable in the marketplace, while others are unobservable. Unobservable inputs require us to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in establishing prices. Changes in assumptions may have a significant effect on values. We determine the estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts using a Black-Scholes based option valuation model. Inputs to the model include the current index value, strike price, interest rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted average interest and dividend rates used as of December 31, 2012 were 2.1% and 3.3%, respectively, and were approximately 3.3% and 3.0%, respectively, as of December 31, 2011. The interest rates as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 were approximately 95 basis points and 153 basis points (on a weighted average basis), respectively, over benchmark interest rates and represented our estimate of our nonperformance risk. We believe, however, that the most significant economic risks under these contracts relate to changes in the index value component and to a lesser degree to the foreign currency component. The Black-Scholes based model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. Our contracts have an average remaining maturity of about 8 years. The weighted average volatility used as of December 31, 2012 was approximately 20.9%, compared to 21.4% as of December 31, 2011. The weighted average volatilities are based on the volatility input for each equity index put option contract weighted by the notional value of each equity index put option contract as compared to the aggregate notional value of all equity index put option contracts. The volatility input for each equity index put option contract reflects our expectation of future price volatility. The impact on fair value as of December 31, 2012 ($7.5 billion) from changes in the volatility assumption is summarized in the table that follows. The values of contracts in an 57 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Derivative contract liabilities (Continued) actual exchange are affected by market conditions and perceptions of the buyers and sellers. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model. Dollars are in millions. Hypothetical change in volatility (percentage points) Hypothetical fair value Increase 2 percentage points $ 7,955 Increase 4 percentage points 8,414 Decrease 2 percentage points 7,057 Decrease 4 percentage points 6,625 In addition, we have exposures relating to a number of credit default contracts written involving corporate and state/municipality issuers. As of December 31, 2012, all credit default contracts involving corporate issuers will expire in 2013. Values associated with these contracts are no longer significant, as the risks of loss are no longer significant. Our states/municipalities exposures begin to expire in 2019. The fair values of our state/municipality issuer credit default contracts are generally based on bond pricing data on the underlying bond issues and credit spread estimates. We monitor and review pricing data and spread estimates for consistency as well as reasonableness with respect to current market conditions. We make no significant adjustments to the pricing data or inputs obtained. Prices in a current market trade involving identical (or sufficiently similar) risks and contract terms as our equity index put option or credit default contracts could differ significantly from the fair values used in the financial statements. We do not operate as a derivatives dealer and currently do not utilize offsetting strategies to hedge these contracts. We intend to allow these contracts to run off to their respective expiration dates. Other Critical Accounting Policies We record deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over the consideration received. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. Deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of remaining loss payments. Adjustments to deferred charge balances resulting from changes to these assumptions are determined retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were approximately $4.0 billion at December 31, 2012. Significant changes in the estimated amount and payment timing of unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $54.5 billion, which includes $1.4 billion arising from our various acquisitions in 2012. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2012. Such tests include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual future results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then individual assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is then charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. 58 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Interest Rate Risk We regularly invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire such securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur with respect to assets. We also strive to maintain high credit ratings so that the cost of our debt is minimized. We rarely utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate instruments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate instruments. The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that there are no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Equity Price Risk Historically, we have maintained large amounts of invested assets in exchange traded equity securities. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices and 59 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Equity Price Risk (Continued) prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few investees. At December 31, 2012, approximately 63% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated in five investees. We often hold equity investments for long periods of time so we are not troubled by short-term price volatility with respect to our investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. We strive to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate potential loss with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, fair values of these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract. These contracts expire between 2018 and 2026 and may not be unilaterally settled before their respective expiration dates. The following table summarizes our equity and other investments and derivative contract liabilities with equity price risk as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. The effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates are also shown. The selected 30% hypothetical changes do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

In addition, we hold investments in major multinational companies that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own, such as The Coca-Cola Company. Our net assets subject to translation are primarily in our insurance and utilities and energy businesses, and to a lesser extent in our manufacturing and services businesses. The translation impact is somewhat offset by transaction gains or losses on net reinsurance liabilities of certain U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies as well as the equity index put option liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries relating to contracts that would be settled in foreign currencies. Commodity Price Risk Our diverse group of operating businesses use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We utilize derivative contracts to a limited degree in managing commodity price risks, most notably at MidAmerican. MidAmerican’s exposures to commodities include variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold and natural gas supply for customers. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage and transmission and transportation constraints. To mitigate a portion of the risk, MidAmerican uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Financial results would be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. MidAmerican also uses futures, options and swap agreements to economically hedge gas and electric commodity prices for physical delivery to non-regulated customers. The table that follows summarizes our commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of MidAmerican as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of each date. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Dollars are in millions.

Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guaranties of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane or act of terrorism that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. 61 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 63.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Amounts are in millions. 2013 2012 2011 Insurance – underwriting $ 1,995 $ 1,046 $ 154 Insurance – investment income 3,708 3,397 3,555 Railroad 3,793 3,372 2,972 Utilities and energy 1,470 1,323 1,204 Manufacturing, service and retailing 4,230 3,699 3,039 Finance and financial products 657 557 516 Other (714 ) (797 ) (665 ) Investment and derivative gains/losses 4,337 2,227 (521 ) Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 19,476 $ 14,824 $ 10,254 Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. Our operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance practices, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate “tone at the top” messages to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. The business segment data (Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting in each of the last three years. Periodic earnings from insurance underwriting are significantly impacted by the magnitude of catastrophe loss events occurring during the period. In 2013, we incurred after-tax losses of approximately $285 million from two catastrophe events in Europe. Insurance underwriting earnings in 2012 included after-tax losses of approximately $725 million from Hurricane Sandy. In 2011, underwriting earnings included after-tax losses of approximately $1.7 billion from several different catastrophe events occurring in that year. Our railroad and utilities and energy businesses generated significant earnings in each of the last three years. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2013 increased about 14.4% over 2012, which was partially attributable to bolt-on business acquisitions completed during the last two years and reductions in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2012 increased significantly over 2011 due primarily to the impact of the acquisition of The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”), which was completed on September 16, 2011. In 2013 and 2012, after-tax investment and derivative gains were approximately $4.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. In each year, after-tax gains included gains from the reductions in estimated liabilities under equity index put option contracts and dispositions of investments, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses. Investment gains in 2013 also included after-tax gains associated with the fair value increases of certain investment securities where the gains or losses were reflected in periodic earnings. In 2012, after-tax investment and derivative gains also included gains from settlements and expirations of credit default contracts. In 2011, after-tax investment and derivative losses were $521 million, reflecting after-tax losses of $1.2 billion related to increases in liabilities under our equity index put option contracts and OTTI losses of $590 million related to certain equity and fixed maturity securities, partially offset by after-tax investment gains of $1.2 billion from the redemptions of our Goldman Sachs and General Electric Preferred Stock investments. We believe that investment and derivatives gains/losses are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance. These gains and losses have caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 31 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing decisions, with limited exceptions, are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income. Underwriting results represent insurance premiums earned less insurance losses, benefits and underwriting expenses incurred. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to BHRG and General Re. For the purpose of this discussion, we considered catastrophe losses significant if the pre-tax losses incurred from a single event (or series of related events such as tornadoes) exceeded $75 million on a consolidated basis. In 2013, we incurred pre-tax losses of $436 million related to two events in Europe. In 2012, we incurred pre-tax losses of approximately $1.1 billion attributable to Hurricane Sandy, which included approximately $490 million incurred by GEICO. In 2011, we incurred pre-tax losses of approximately $2.6 billion, arising from nine events. The largest losses were from the earthquakes in Japan ($1.25 billion) and New Zealand ($650 million) in the first quarter. Additionally, we incurred losses from several weather related events in the Pacific Rim and the U.S. Our periodic underwriting results may be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. In 2011, we reduced estimated liabilities related to certain retroactive reinsurance contracts which resulted in an increase in pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $875 million. These reductions were primarily due to lower than expected loss experience of one ceding company. Actual claim settlements and revised loss estimates will develop over time, which will likely differ from the liability estimates recorded as of year-end (approximately $65 billion). Accordingly, the unpaid loss estimates recorded as of December 31, 2013 may develop upward or downward in future periods, producing a corresponding decrease or increase, respectively, to pre-tax earnings. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based subsidiaries as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Historically, currency exchange rates have been volatile and the resulting impact on our underwriting earnings has been relatively significant. These gains and losses are included in underwriting expenses. A key marketing strategy of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $129 billion at December 31, 2013. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers. Underwriting results from our insurance businesses are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. 2013 2012 2011 Underwriting gain (loss) attributable to: GEICO $ 1,127 $ 680 $ 576 General Re 283 355 144 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 1,294 304 (714 ) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 385 286 242 Pre-tax underwriting gain 3,089 1,625 248 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,094 579 94 Net underwriting gain $ 1,995 $ 1,046 $ 154 32 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO Through GEICO, we primarily write private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO’s policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. This is a significant element in our strategy to be a low-cost auto insurer. In addition, we strive to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICO’s underwriting results are summarized below. Dollars are in millions. 2013 2012 2011 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 19,083 $ 17,129 $ 15,664 Premiums earned $ 18,572 100.0 $ 16,740 100.0 $ 15,363 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 14,255 76.7 12,700 75.9 12,013 78.2 Underwriting expenses 3,190 17.2 3,360 20.0 2,774 18.1 Total losses and expenses 17,445 93.9 16,060 95.9 14,787 96.3 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 1,127 $ 680 $ 576 Premiums written in 2013 were $19.1 billion, an increase of 11.4% over premiums written in 2012. Premiums earned in 2013 increased approximately $1.8 billion (10.9%) compared to premiums earned in 2012. The growth in premiums written and earned reflected an increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force of 7.8% over the past year and, to a lesser degree, higher average premiums per policy. The increase in policies-in-force reflected a 12.1% increase in voluntary auto new business sales. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2013 were approximately 898,000 greater than at December 31, 2012. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2013 increased $1.56 billion (12.2%) compared to 2012. The loss ratio (the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned) was 76.7% in 2013 compared to 75.9% in 2012. In 2013, claims frequencies for property damage and collision coverages generally increased in the two to four percent range compared to 2012. Physical damage claims severities increased in the three to four percent range in 2013. In addition, average bodily injury claims frequencies increased in the one to two percent range. Bodily injury claims severities increased in the one to three percent range, although severities for personal injury protection coverage declined, primarily in Florida. In both 2013 and 2012, losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred were favorably impacted by reductions of estimates for prior years’ losses. Underwriting expenses incurred in 2013 declined $170 million (5.1%) compared with 2012. Underwriting expenses in 2012 were impacted by a change in U.S. GAAP concerning deferred policy acquisition costs (“DPAC”). DPAC represents the underwriting costs that are capitalized and expensed as premiums are earned over the policy period. The new accounting standard, which we adopted on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2012, accelerates the timing of when certain underwriting costs are recognized in earnings. We estimate that GEICO’s underwriting expenses in 2012 would have been about $410 million less had we computed DPAC under the prior accounting standard. The effect of transitioning to this new accounting standard was completed in 2012. Excluding the effects of the accounting change in 2012, the ratio of underwriting expenses to premiums earned (the “expense ratio”) in 2013 declined by approximately 0.4 percentage points from 2012. Premiums earned in 2012 were approximately $16.7 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion (9.0%) over 2011. The growth in premiums earned for voluntary auto was 9.0% as a result of a 6.5% increase in policies-in-force and an increase in average premium per policy as compared to 2011. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2012 increased slightly compared with 2011. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2012 were approximately 704,000 greater than at December 31, 2011. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2012 were $12.7 billion, an increase of $687 million (5.7%) over 2011. The loss ratio was 75.9% in 2012 and 78.2% in 2011. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2012 included $490 million related to Hurricane Sandy. With the exception of Hurricane Sandy, GEICO’s catastrophe losses tend to occur regularly and are normally not individually significant in amount. Despite the losses from Hurricane Sandy, our loss ratio declined in 2012 as compared to 2011. Claims frequencies for property damage and collision coverages were down about one percent, comprehensive coverage frequencies were down about ten percent, excluding Hurricane Sandy, and frequencies for bodily injury coverages were relatively unchanged. Physical 33 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) damage severities increased in the two to four percent range and bodily injury severities increased in the one to three percent range from 2011. Underwriting expenses incurred in 2012 increased $586 million (21.1%) compared with 2011. The increase was primarily the result of the change in U.S. GAAP concerning DPAC discussed previously. We estimate that GEICO’s underwriting expenses in 2012 would have been about $410 million less had we computed DPAC under the prior accounting standard. Based on that estimate, GEICO’s expense ratio in 2012 would have been less than in 2011. General Re Through General Re, we conduct a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. We write property and casualty reinsurance in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Germany-based General Reinsurance AG and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written in broker markets through Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG. General Re strives to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines. Our management does not evaluate underwriting performance based upon market share and our underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Re’s underwriting results are summarized in the following table. Amounts are in millions. Premiums written Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 Property/casualty $ 2,972 $ 2,982 $ 2,910 $ 3,007 $ 2,904 $ 2,941 $ 148 $ 399 $ 7 Life/health 2,991 3,002 2,909 2,977 2,966 2,875 135 (44 ) 137 $ 5,963 $ 5,984 $ 5,819 $ 5,984 $ 5,870 $ 5,816 $ 283 $ 355 $ 144 Property/casualty Property/casualty premiums written in 2013 were relatively unchanged while premiums earned increased $103 million (3.5%), versus the corresponding 2012 period. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written and premiums earned in 2013 increased $8 million (0.3%) and $83 million (2.9%), respectively, versus 2012. This was primarily due to increases in European treaty business. Price competition in most property and casualty lines persists. Our underwriters continue to exercise discipline by declining offers to write business where prices are deemed inadequate. We remain prepared to increase premium volumes should market conditions improve. Property/casualty operations in 2013 produced net underwriting gains of $148 million which consisted of $153 million of gains from our property business and $5 million of losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business. In 2013, property results included catastrophe losses of approximately $400 million attributable to a hailstorm ($280 million) and floods ($120 million) in Europe. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual losses has produced and is expected to continue to produce significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. Property underwriting results also included gains from reductions of $375 million in loss reserve estimates for prior years’ loss events as a result of lower than expected losses reported from ceding companies. The underwriting loss from casualty/workers’ compensation business included $141 million of losses attributable to discount accretion related to prior years’ workers’ compensation liabilities and net underwriting losses attributable to current year business, offset by reductions in estimated liabilities for prior year losses. Premiums written in 2012 increased $72 million (2.5%), while premiums earned declined $37 million (1.3%) from 2011. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written increased $158 million (5.4%) compared to 2011 which reflected increased volume in most of our major markets around the globe. Before the effects of currency exchange, premiums earned in 2012 increased $61 million (2.1%) over 2011 which was primarily attributable to an increase in European property treaty business. Underwriting gains were $399 million in 2012 and consisted of $352 million of gains from our property business and $47 million of gains from casualty/workers’ compensation business. Our property results included $266 million of catastrophe losses primarily attributable to Hurricane Sandy ($226 million), an earthquake in Northern Italy and various tornadoes in the Midwest. The underwriting gains from casualty/workers’ compensation business included lower than expected losses from prior years’ 34 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) casualty business, offset in part by discount accretion of workers’ compensation liabilities and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance contracts. Underwriting gains were $7 million in 2011 and consisted of a net underwriting gain of $127 million from casualty/workers’ compensation business substantially offset by a net underwriting loss of $120 million from property business. Our property results in 2011 included $861 million of catastrophe losses. The catastrophe losses were primarily attributable to earthquakes in New Zealand ($235 million) and Japan ($189 million), as well as several weather related loss events in the United States, Europe and Australia, with losses ranging from about $30 million to $75 million per event. The underwriting gain of $127 million from casualty/workers’ compensation business reflected overall reductions in loss reserve estimates for prior years’ loss events, which was partially offset by discount accretion associated with workers’ compensation liabilities and deferred charge amortization. Life/health In 2013, premiums written decreased $11 million (0.4%), while premiums earned increased $11 million (0.4%) compared with 2012. Adjusting for the effects of currency exchange rate changes, premiums written in 2013 increased $9 million (0.3%) over 2012 and premiums earned were $32 million (1.1%), higher than 2012. The increases, before foreign currency effects, were primarily attributable to increased non-U.S. life business. Life/health operations in 2013 produced net underwriting gains of $135 million, which were driven by lower than expected mortality, offset in part by discount accretion in the long-term care business. Premiums written in 2012 increased $93 million (3.2%) and earned premiums increased $91 million (3.2%) from 2011. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written and earned in 2012 increased $239 million (8.2%) and $236 million (8.2%), respectively, compared to 2011. The increases in premiums written and earned were primarily attributed to increased writings in non-U.S. life business. The underwriting results for 2012 were negatively impacted by a premium deficiency reserve that was established on the run off of the U.S. long-term care book of business as well as greater than expected claims frequency and duration in the individual and group disability business in Australia. Underwriting results for 2011 included losses of $15 million attributable to the earthquake in Japan, offset by lower than expected mortality in the life business. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group Through BHRG, we underwrite excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages on property and casualty risks for insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG’s business includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and excess primary insurance and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual property risks referred to as individual risk. BHRG also writes retroactive reinsurance, which provides indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Multi-line property/casualty refers to various coverages written on both a quota-share and excess basis and includes a 20% quota-share contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. (“Swiss Re”) covering substantially all of Swiss Re’s property/casualty risks incepting between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012. The Swiss Re quota-share contract is now in run-off. BHRG’s underwriting activities also include life reinsurance and traditional annuity businesses. BHRG’s underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in millions. Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain/loss 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 Catastrophe and individual risk $ 801 $ 816 $ 751 $ 581 $ 400 $ (321 ) Retroactive reinsurance 328 717 2,011 (321 ) (201 ) 645 Other multi-line property/casualty 4,348 5,306 4,224 655 295 (338 ) Life and annuity 3,309 2,833 2,161 379 (190 ) (700 ) $ 8,786 $ 9,672 $ 9,147 $ 1,294 $ 304 $ (714 ) Catastrophe and individual risk premiums written were $807 million in 2013, $785 million in 2012, and $720 million in 2011. The level of business written in a given period will vary significantly depending on changes in market conditions and 35 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) management’s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. We have constrained the volume of business written in recent years. However, we have the capacity and desire to write substantially more business when appropriate pricing can be obtained. Periodic underwriting results of our catastrophe and individual risk business are subject to extraordinary volatility, depending on the timing and magnitude of significant catastrophe losses. In 2013, we incurred losses of $20 million from floods in Europe, while in 2012 we incurred losses of $96 million in connection with Hurricane Sandy. In 2011, we incurred losses of approximately $800 million attributable to the earthquakes in Japan ($700 million) and New Zealand ($100 million). Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events, and related claims are generally expected to be paid over long periods of time. Premiums and limits of indemnification are often very large in amount. Coverages are generally subject to policy limits. Premiums earned in 2013, 2012 and 2011 were attributed to a relatively small number of contracts. Premiums earned under retroactive reinsurance contracts in 2011 included approximately $1.7 billion from a reinsurance contract with Eaglestone Reinsurance Company, a subsidiary of American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”). Under the contract, we agreed to reinsure the bulk of AIG’s U.S. asbestos liabilities. The agreement provides for a maximum limit of indemnification of $3.5 billion. Underwriting results attributable to retroactive reinsurance include the recurring periodic amortization of deferred charges that are established with respect to these contracts. At the inception of a contract, deferred charge assets are recorded as the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate losses payable over the premiums earned. Deferred charge balances are subsequently amortized over the estimated claims payment period using the interest method, which reflects estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments. The original estimates of the timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are periodically analyzed against actual experience and revised based on an actuarial evaluation of the expected remaining losses. Amortization charges and deferred charge adjustments resulting from changes to the estimated timing and amount of future loss payments are included as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. The underwriting losses from retroactive policies of $321 million in 2013 and $201 million in 2012 primarily represented the amortization of deferred charges. In 2013, we increased undiscounted estimated liabilities by approximately $300 million related to prior years’ contracts, which was partially offset by increases in related deferred charge balances. In 2011, the net underwriting gain from retroactive reinsurance contracts of $645 million reflected the favorable impact of an $865 million reduction in the estimated liabilities related to an adverse loss development contract with Swiss Re, which was attributable to better than expected loss experience. Gross unpaid losses from retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $17.7 billion as of December 31, 2013, $18.0 billion at December 31, 2012 and $18.8 billion at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 unamortized deferred charges related to BHRG’s retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $4.25 billion and $3.90 billion, respectively. Premiums earned from multi-line property/casualty business in 2013 declined $958 million (18%) compared to 2012, while premiums earned in 2012 increased approximately $1.1 billion (26%) over 2011. As previously noted, the Swiss Re 20% quota-share contract expired on December 31, 2012. As a result, premiums earned in 2013 from that contract declined $1.9 billion (57%) compared with 2012. Premiums earned under the Swiss Re quota-share contract were $3.4 billion in 2012 and $2.9 billion in 2011. Premiums earned in 2013 from multi-line business, other than from the Swiss Re quota-share contract, increased $981 million (52%) over 2012, which was primarily attributable to increased property quota-share business. Multi-line property/casualty generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $655 million in 2013 and $295 million in 2012. This business produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $338 million in 2011. Periodic underwriting results can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and foreign currency transaction gains or losses associated with the changes in the valuation of certain reinsurance liabilities of U.S.-based subsidiaries (including liabilities arising under retroactive reinsurance contracts), which are denominated in foreign currencies. Multi-line property/casualty underwriting results in 2013 included losses of $16 million from floods and a hailstorm in Europe. Underwriting results in 2012 included estimated losses of $268 million from Hurricane Sandy. Catastrophe losses were approximately $933 million in 2011, which arose primarily from the earthquakes in Japan ($375 million) and New Zealand ($300 million) and from floods in Thailand ($150 million). The catastrophe losses in 2011 and 2012 arose primarily under the 36 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Swiss Re quota-share contract. Underwriting results included foreign currency transaction losses of $28 million in 2013 and $123 million in 2012 and gains of $140 million in 2011. Life and annuity premiums earned in 2013 increased $476 million (17%) over premiums earned in 2012. In 2013, premiums earned included $1.7 billion received in connection with a new reinsurance contract which provides coverage of guaranteed minimum death benefits on a portfolio of variable annuity reinsurance contracts that have been in run-off for a number of years. Premiums earned in 2013 also included $1.4 billion from traditional annuity insurance and reinsurance contracts that provide for streams of periodic payments in the future in exchange for upfront consideration. Annuity premiums in 2012 were $794 million. These increases were partially offset by the reversal of premiums previously earned (approximately $1.3 billion) under the Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc. (“SRLHA”) yearly renewable term life insurance contract as a result of contract amendments in 2013. The amendments essentially commuted coverage with respect to a number of the underlying contracts in exchange for payments to SRLHA of $675 million. The life and annuity business produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $379 million in 2013. The underwriting gains in 2013 included a one-time pre-tax gain of $255 million attributable to the aforementioned amendments to the SRLHA contract as the reversal of premiums earned was more than offset by the reversal of life benefits incurred. The one-time underwriting gain related to the SRLHA contract partially offset the significant underwriting losses incurred under that contract over the previous three years. Underwriting results in 2013 also included pre-tax gains of approximately $250 million related to the variable annuity guarantee business written in 2013. The gains were primarily attributable to the impact of rising equity markets which lowered estimates of liabilities for guaranteed minimum benefits. The annuity business normally generates periodic underwriting losses as a result of the periodic accretion of discounted annuity liabilities. Periodic underwriting results are also impacted by adjustments for mortality experience and changes in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to certain of the contracts. Annuity business produced net underwriting losses of $178 million in 2013. The life and annuity business generated pre-tax underwriting losses of $190 million in 2012 and $700 million in 2011. Annuity business produced net underwriting losses of $159 million in 2012 and $118 million in 2011. In 2011, we also recorded a pre-tax underwriting loss of $642 million with respect to the SRLHA contract. Mortality rates under that contract persistently exceeded the assumptions we made at the inception of the contract. During the fourth quarter of 2011, after considerable internal actuarial analysis, our management concluded that future mortality rates are expected to be greater than our original assumptions. As a result, we increased our estimated liabilities for future policyholder benefits to reflect the new assumptions. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses. These businesses include: Medical Protective Company and Princeton Insurance Company (“Princeton,” acquired in December 2011), providers of healthcare malpractice insurance coverages; National Indemnity Company’s primary group, writers of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as “Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies,” providers of commercial multi-line insurance, including workers’ compensation; Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and disability insurance; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers’ compensation solutions; and BoatU.S., a writer of insurance for owners of boats and small watercraft. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we acquired GUARD Insurance Group (“GUARD”), a provider of workers’ compensation and complimentary commercial property and casualty insurance coverage to small and mid-sized businesses. In the second quarter of 2013, we formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance which concentrates on providing large scale capacity solutions for commercial property and casualty risks. Premiums earned in 2013 by BH Primary aggregated $3,342 million, an increase of $1,079 million (48%) over 2012. Premiums earned in 2012 by BH Primary were $2,263 million, an increase of $514 million (29%) over 2011. The comparative increases in 2013 and 2012 reflected the impact of the GUARD acquisition in 2012 and Princeton at the end of 2011. In addition, Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies’ premiums earned increased $301 million in 2013 and $188 million in 2012 compared to the corresponding prior years, due primarily to significantly higher workers’ compensation insurance volume. BH Primary produced underwriting gains of $385 million in 2013, $286 million in 2012 and $242 million in 2011. The gains reflected a generally favorable claim environment over the three years, which resulted in loss ratios of 60% in 2013, 58% in 2012 and 52% in 2011. 37 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income of our insurance operations follows. Amounts are in millions. 2013 2012 2011 Investment income before taxes and noncontrolling interests $ 4,713 $ 4,454 $ 4,725 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,005 1,057 1,170 Net investment income $ 3,708 $ 3,397 $ 3,555 Investment income consists of interest and dividends earned on cash and investments of our insurance businesses. Pre-tax investment income in 2013 increased $259 million (5.8%) compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to increased dividends earned on equity investments, which reflected increased dividend rates for certain of our larger equity holdings as well as increased overall investments in equity securities. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2013, investment income no longer includes interest from our investments in Wrigley 11.45% subordinated notes ($4.4 billion par), as a result of the repurchase of those notes by Mars/Wrigley. In addition, other higher yielding fixed maturity investments were redeemed in 2013 or will mature in 2014. Investment income in 2014 is expected to decline compared to 2013 given that investment opportunities currently available will likely generate considerably lower yields. We continue to hold significant cash and cash equivalents earning very low yields. However, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to cash and cash equivalents. Pre-tax investment income in 2012 declined $271 million (6%) compared to 2011. The decline reflected the redemptions in 2011 of our investments in Goldman Sachs 10% Preferred Stock (insurance subsidiaries held 87% of the $5 billion aggregate investment) and in General Electric 10% Preferred Stock ($3 billion aggregate investment). Dividends earned by our insurance subsidiaries from these investments were $420 million in 2011. Investment income in 2012 reflected dividends earned for the full year from our investment in September 2011 in Bank of America 6% Preferred Stock (insurance subsidiaries hold 80% of the $5 billion aggregate investment) and increased dividend rates with respect to several of our common stock investments. Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $77 billion at December 31, 2013, $73 billion at December 31, 2012, and $70 billion at December 31, 2011. The cost of float was negative over the last three years as our insurance business generated underwriting gains in each year. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 follows. Other investments include investments in The Dow Chemical Company and Bank of America Corporation. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts are in millions.

Foreign government securities include obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by national or provincial government entities. Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states and two Canadian provinces. BNSF’s major business groups are classified by product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. Earnings of BNSF are summarized below (in millions). 2013 2012 2011 Revenues $ 22,014 $ 20,835 $ 19,548 Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 4,651 4,505 4,315 Fuel 4,503 4,459 4,267 Purchased services 2,418 2,374 2,218 Depreciation and amortization 1,973 1,889 1,807 Equipment rents, materials and other 1,812 1,608 1,640 Total operating expenses 15,357 14,835 14,247 Interest expense 729 623 560 16,086 15,458 14,807 Pre-tax earnings 5,928 5,377 4,741 Income taxes 2,135 2,005 1,769 Net earnings $ 3,793 $ 3,372 $ 2,972 Revenues for 2013 were approximately $22.0 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion (5.7%) over 2012. The overall year-to-date increase in revenues reflected a 4.5% increase in cars/units handled and a slight increase in average revenue per car/unit, attributable to rates. In 2013, BNSF generated higher revenues from industrial products, consumer products and coal, partially offset by lower revenues from agricultural products. In 2013, industrial products revenues of $5.7 billion increased 14% versus 2012, driven by an 11% increase in volume, reflecting significantly higher petroleum products volumes. Consumer products revenues in 2013 were $7.0 billion, an increase of 6% over 2012 that was primarily attributable to volume increases from domestic intermodal business and higher export demand. Coal revenues were $5.0 billion in 2013, an increase of 2.6% over 2012, which was attributable to increased volume. The volume increase reflected increased coal demand as a result of higher natural gas prices and reduced utility stockpiles, partially offset by severe weather issues impacting service levels. In 2013, agricultural products revenues of $3.6 billion declined 4% versus 2012 due to volume declines, which were mainly attributable to lower grain exports as a result of the drought conditions in the U.S. in 2012 and strong global competition. 39 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Revenues (and revenues per car/unit) in each period include fuel surcharges to customers under programs intended to recover incremental fuel costs when fuel prices exceed threshold fuel prices. Surcharges vary by product/commodity, and therefore amounts earned in a given period are impacted by business mix and volume as well as fuel costs. Fuel surcharges increased 3% in 2013 as compared to 2012. Operating expenses in 2013 were approximately $15.4 billion, an increase of $522 million (3.5%) compared to 2012. Compensation and benefits expenses in 2013 increased $146 million (3.2%) in 2013 as compared to 2012, reflecting volume-related cost increases and wage inflation. In 2013, fuel expenses increased $44 million (1%) versus 2012, as the impact of higher volume was partially offset by lower average fuel prices. Purchased services expenses in 2013 increased 2% versus 2012, due primarily to volume-related costs, including purchased transportation for BNSF Logistics LLC, a wholly-owned, third-party logistics business. In 2013, equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $204 million (13%) over 2012. The increase was primarily due to higher property taxes, crew travel costs, derailment-related costs and locomotive material expenses in 2013. Interest expense in 2013 increased $106 million (17%) compared to 2012 due to higher average outstanding debt balances. Revenues in 2012 were approximately $20.8 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion (7%) over 2011. Overall, the revenue increase in 2012 reflected higher average revenues per car/unit of approximately 4% as well as a 2% increase in cars/units handled (“volume”). Revenues in each period include fuel surcharges to customers under programs intended to recover incremental fuel costs when fuel prices exceed threshold fuel prices. Fuel surcharges in 2012 increased 6% over 2011, and are reflected in average revenue per car/unit. The increase in overall volume during 2012 included increases in consumer products (4%) and industrial products (13%), partially offset by declines in coal (6%) and agricultural products (3%). The consumer products volume increase was primarily attributable to higher domestic intermodal and automotive volume. Industrial products volume increased primarily as a result of increased shipments of petroleum and construction products. The decline in coal unit volume in 2012 was attributed to lower coal demand as a result of low natural gas prices and high utility stockpiles. Agricultural product volume declined in 2012 compared to 2011, reflecting lower wheat and corn shipments for export partially offset by higher soybean and U.S. corn shipments. Operating expenses in 2012 increased $588 million (4%) compared to 2011. Compensation and benefits expenses in 2012 increased $190 million (4%) over 2011 due to the increased volume as well as wage inflation, partially offset by increased productivity and lower weather-related costs. Fuel expenses in 2012 increased $192 million (4.5%) due to higher fuel prices and increased volume, partially offset by improved fuel efficiency. Fuel efficiency in 2011 was negatively impacted by severe weather conditions. Purchased services costs in 2012 increased $156 million (7%) compared to 2011 due primarily to increased volume, increased purchased transportation services of BNSF Logistics and increased equipment maintenance costs, partially offset by lower weather-related costs. Interest expense in 2012 increased $63 million (11%) versus 2011, due principally to higher average outstanding debt balances. Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) We hold an 89.8% ownership interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (“MidAmerican”), which operates an international energy business. MidAmerican’s domestic regulated utility interests are currently comprised of four companies, PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”), as well as Nevada Power Company and Sierra Pacific Power Company (together, “NV Energy”). NV Energy was acquired on December 19, 2013. MidAmerican also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. In Great Britain, MidAmerican subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. The rates that our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent these operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, MidAmerican also operates a diversified portfolio of independent power projects and the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm and franchise network in the United States. 40 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) (Continued) Revenues and earnings of MidAmerican are summarized below. Revenues and earnings of NV Energy since December 19, 2013 are included in other. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 PacifiCorp $ 5,215 $ 4,950 $ 4,639 $ 982 $ 737 $ 771 MidAmerican Energy Company 3,453 3,275 3,530 230 236 279 Natural gas pipelines 971 978 993 385 383 388 Northern Powergrid 1,026 1,036 1,016 362 429 469 Real estate brokerage 1,822 1,333 1,007 139 82 39 Other 256 175 106 4 91 36 $ 12,743 $ 11,747 $ 11,291 Earnings before corporate interest and income taxes 2,102 1,958 1,982 Corporate interest 296 314 336 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 170 172 315 Net earnings $ 1,636 $ 1,472 $ 1,331 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire $ 1,470 $ 1,323 $ 1,204 PacifiCorp operates a regulated utility business in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. PacifiCorp’s revenues in 2013 were $5.2 billion, an increase of $265 million (5%) compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to higher retail revenues of $337 million, partially offset by lower renewable energy credits ($74 million). The increase in retail revenues reflected higher prices approved by regulators and higher retail customer loads. PacifiCorp’s earnings before corporate interest and taxes (“EBIT”) in 2013 were $982 million, an increase of $245 million (33%) compared to 2012. The comparative increase in EBIT was primarily due to charges of $165 million in 2012 related to litigation, fire and other damage claims, and, to a lesser extent, the increase in revenues. Before the impact of the aforementioned claims, pre-tax earnings in 2013 as a percentage of revenues were relatively unchanged from 2012. In 2012, PacifiCorp’s revenues increased $311 million (7%) over revenues in 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher retail revenues of $244 million, which were due to higher prices approved by regulators across most of PacifiCorp’s jurisdictions and to a lesser degree from increased revenues from renewable energy credits. In 2012, PacifiCorp also experienced generally higher customer load in Utah, which was offset by lower industrial customer load in Wyoming and Oregon, attributable to certain large customers electing to self-generate their own power and by lower residential customer load in Oregon as a result of unfavorable weather. EBIT in 2012 declined $34 million (4%) compared to the corresponding 2011 period. EBIT in 2012 was negatively impacted by the aforementioned litigation, fire and other claims ($165 million), which more than offset the increase in operating earnings from higher revenues and otherwise higher operating margins. MEC operates a regulated utility business primarily in Iowa and Illinois. MEC’s revenues in 2013 increased $178 million (5%) over 2012. Revenues in 2013 reflected higher regulated electric and natural gas revenues and lower nonregulated and other revenues. In 2013, regulated retail electric operating revenues increased $82 million, while regulated natural gas revenues increased $165 million compared to 2012. The increase in regulated electric revenues was primarily due to higher regulatory rates in Iowa and Illinois and increases in retail customer load. The increase in regulated natural gas revenues was primarily due to higher retail volumes and increases in recoveries through adjustment clauses as a result of a higher average per-unit cost of gas sold. Nonregulated and other operating revenues in 2013 declined $67 million in comparison with 2012 due primarily to lower electricity volumes and prices. MEC’s EBIT in 2013 declined $6 million (3%) compared to 2012. The decline in EBIT was due to lower regulated and nonregulated electric operating earnings, partially offset by higher natural gas earnings. MEC’s revenues in 2012 declined $255 million (7%) compared to 2011, reflecting declines in natural gas revenues of $110 million and nonregulated and other operating revenues of $178 million. In 2012, MEC’s regulated electric revenues increased 2% to approximately $1.7 billion. The decline in natural gas revenues reflected lower average per-unit cost of natural gas sold and lower volumes. The nonregulated and other operating revenues decline was due to generally lower electricity and natural gas prices. MEC’s EBIT in 2012 declined $43 million (15%) compared to 2011 due primarily to increased depreciation expense of $56 million and higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower interest expense. 41 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) (Continued) In 2013, natural gas pipelines’ revenues and EBIT were $971 million and $385 million, respectively, which were relatively unchanged from 2012. In 2012, natural gas pipelines’ revenues and EBIT declined $15 million and $5 million, respectively, compared to 2011. In 2012, natural gas revenues increased from expansion projects and from higher transportation and storage rates in certain markets, which were more than offset by lower volumes of gas sales and the impact of contract expirations. In 2012, EBIT also reflected increased depreciation expense, partially offset by lower interest expense. In 2013, Northern Powergrid revenues declined $10 million (1%) compared to 2012. EBIT in 2013 was $362 million, a decline of $67 million versus 2012. EBIT in 2013 was negatively impacted by fourth quarter rebates to customers and higher regulatory rate provisions in 2013, which reduced revenues, and from higher distribution operating expenses and the foreign currency translation effect of a stronger U.S. Dollar versus the U.K. Pound Sterling. Operating expenses in 2013 included increased pension costs and higher depreciation expenses. EBIT in 2013 also included a $9 million loss from the write-off of hydrocarbon well exploration costs. Northern Powergrid’s revenues in 2012 increased $20 million (2%) while EBIT declined $40 million (9%) compared to 2011. In 2012, revenues were negatively impacted by currency-related declines from a stronger U.S. Dollar. Excluding currency related impacts, distribution revenues increased $28 million in 2012, reflecting higher tariff rates ($76 million), partially offset by the impact of higher regulatory provisions in 2011 ($55 million). Northern Powergrid’s EBIT in 2012 was negatively affected by increases in pension expense ($44 million) and distribution operating expenses ($21 million), which more than offset the increase in distribution revenues. Real estate brokerage revenues in 2013 increased $489 million (37%) over 2012, while EBIT increased $57 million (70%) versus 2012. The increases in revenues and EBIT were attributable to increases in closed brokerage transactions and higher average home sales prices from existing business and the impact of businesses acquired during the last two years. Real estate brokerage revenues in 2012 increased $326 million (32%) and EBIT increased $43 million (110%) over 2011. The revenue increase included $123 million from businesses acquired in 2012. The increase in revenues in 2012 also reflected a 16% increase in closed sales transactions and higher average home sale prices from existing businesses. The increase in real estate brokerage EBIT in 2012 reflected the impact of business acquisitions in 2012 as well as the aforementioned increase in closed sales transactions. MidAmerican’s other activities primarily consist of a portfolio of independent power projects, including solar and wind-powered electricity generation projects placed in service in late 2012 and throughout 2013. In 2013, other activities also included the results of NV Energy since the December 19, 2013 acquisition date. The increase in revenues from other activities in 2013 was $81 million, which was primarily attributable to revenues from the new solar and wind-powered facilities, partially offset by the impact of one-time customer refunds issued by NV Energy and impairment losses associated with MidAmerican’s interests in certain geothermal electricity generation projects. EBIT in 2013 from other activities declined $87 million compared to 2012, as the impacts of the aforementioned losses associated with geothermal projects and NV Energy acquisition costs and customer refunds, more than offset the increase in earnings from the new solar and wind-powered electricity generation projects. Corporate interest includes interest on the unsecured debt issued by MidAmerican Energy Holding Company. Corporate interest expense in 2014 is expected to increase compared to recent years as a result of new borrowings in connection with the NV Energy acquisition, including borrowings from certain Berkshire insurance subsidiaries. MidAmerican’s consolidated income tax expense as percentages of pre-tax earnings were 7% in 2013, 9% in 2012 and 18% in 2011. In each year, MidAmerican’s utility subsidiaries generated significant production tax credits. In addition, pre-tax earnings of Northern Powergrid are taxed at lower rates in the U.K. and each year also benefitted from reductions of deferred income taxes as a result of lower enacted corporate income tax rates in the U.K. 42 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 Marmon $ 6,979 $ 7,171 $ 6,925 $ 1,176 $ 1,137 $ 992 McLane Company 45,930 37,437 33,279 486 403 370 Other manufacturing 29,098 26,757 21,191 3,608 3,319 2,397 Other service 8,996 8,175 7,438 1,096 966 977 Retailing 4,288 3,715 3,573 376 306 301 $ 95,291 $ 83,255 $ 72,406 Pre-tax earnings 6,742 6,131 5,037 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 2,512 2,432 1,998 $ 4,230 $ 3,699 $ 3,039 Marmon Through Marmon, we operate approximately 160 manufacturing and service businesses within eleven diverse business sectors that are further organized in three separate companies. Those companies and constituent sectors are: Company Sector Marmon Engineered Industrial & Metal Components (“Engineered Components”) Electrical & Plumbing Products Distribution, Distribution Services, Industrial Products Marmon Natural Resources & Transportation Services (“Natural Resources”) Transportation Services & Engineered Products, Engineered Wire & Cable, Crane Services Marmon Retail & End User Technologies (“Retail Technologies”) Highway Technologies, Water Treatment, Retail Store Fixtures, Food Service Equipment, Retail Home Improvement Products Marmon’s consolidated revenues in 2013 were approximately $7.0 billion, 2.7% below 2012, with almost 60% of the decline associated with metals price deflation. Consolidated pre-tax earnings were $1.2 billion, an increase of 3.4% over 2012. Pre-tax earnings in 2013 as a percentage of revenues was 16.9% in 2013 compared with 15.9% in 2012. This margin improvement is a direct result of Marmon’s focus on niche products/markets, product/service innovation and improvement in operating efficiency and productivity. The pre-tax earnings information in the paragraphs that follow, exclude unallocated corporate expenses of $30 million in 2013 and $34 million in 2012. Engineered Components’ 2013 revenues were $2.3 billion, a decline of 5% as compared to 2012. The revenue decline was primarily due to the impact of lower metals (steel and copper) costs, which are passed on to customers with minimal margin, as well as reductions in volume in Distribution Services, partially offset by increased volume in the Industrial Products sector. Engineered Components’ pre-tax earnings were $204 million in 2013, representing a decline of 4% from earnings in 2012. The decline in pre-tax earnings in 2013 reflected reduced margins in the Distribution Services sector, attributable to lower sales volumes and steel price reductions. Electrical & Plumbing Products sector 2013 pre-tax earnings increased over 2012, despite lower revenues. Restructuring actions taken in 2012 and 2013 have provided the impetus for improved pre-tax earnings in this sector. Industrial Products sector pre-tax earnings increase in 2013 over 2012 was driven by higher volumes and improved product mix. Natural Resources’ revenues were $2.5 billion in 2013, a decline of 3% compared to 2012. The decrease in revenues was attributable to several non-recurring large prior year projects in the Transportation Services & Engineered Products (“TSEP”) and Engineered Wire and Cable sectors and lower revenues from external tank car sales, partially offset by higher rail leasing revenues attributable to higher lease rates and new tank car fleet additions. Natural Resources’ pre-tax earnings were $718 million in 2013, an increase of 3% over 2012. Earnings in 2013 reflected higher rail leasing rates and new tank car fleet 43 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Marmon (Continued) additions which more than offset the prior year higher project revenues, higher railcar repair costs and lower sales volume of external tank cars. Retail Technologies’ revenues were $2.2 billion in 2013, unchanged from 2012. Revenues increased in 2013 in Highway Technologies’ driven by growth in the automotive clutch and heavy duty truck axle businesses, Retail Store Fixtures, as a result of a significant store fixture display product rollout for a key customer and Water Treatment, driven by growth in residential products. These revenue increases were offset by a revenue decrease at Retail Home Improvement Products due to a planned reduction in revenues from lower margin products. Retail Technologies’ pre-tax earnings in 2013 were $284 million which represented an increase of 8% over 2012. The pre-tax earnings increases were primarily due to revenue growth in the Highway Technologies, Retail Store Fixtures and Water Treatment sectors, as well as cost savings related to 2012 restructuring actions taken in the Retail Store Fixtures sector. Marmon’s consolidated revenues in 2012 were $7.2 billion, an increase of 3.6% over 2011. Consolidated pre-tax earnings were $1.1 billion in 2012, an increase of 14.6% over 2011. In 2012 pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 15.9% compared to 14.3% in 2011. Engineered Components’ 2012 revenues were $2.4 billion, a decline of 2% as compared to 2011. The revenue decline was primarily due to lower volume and copper pricing in the Electrical & Plumbing Products sector driven by lower HVAC demand and continued softness in commercial construction in 2012, offset in part by a 2012 bolt-on acquisition and increased market share in certain market niches in the Distribution Services sector. Engineered Components’ pre-tax earnings were $214 million, an increase of 3% from 2011. The increase in pre-tax earnings in 2012 reflected the growth in market share and higher margins in the Distribution Services sector, partially offset by the revenue declines in the Electrical & Plumbing Products sector. Natural Resources’ revenues were $2.6 billion in 2012, an increase of 10% compared to 2011. The increase in revenues was attributable to bolt-on acquisitions in the Crane Services and Engineered Wire & Cable sectors in 2012 and growth in the TSEP sector. Higher rail fleet utilization and higher lease rates, offset in part by lower external tank car sales provided most of TSEP’s growth, with sulfur equipment installations in the Middle East providing the balance. Natural Resources’ pre-tax earnings were $695 million in 2012, an increase of 23% from earnings in 2011. Earnings in 2012 reflected the impact of the aforementioned bolt-on acquisitions, higher rail fleet utilization and lease rates and Middle East projects, as well cost savings relating to restructuring actions taken in 2011 in the Engineered Wire & Cable sector. Retail Technologies’ revenues were $2.2 billion in 2012, an increase of 3% compared to 2011. The 2012 revenue increase is due to the full year impact of a bolt-on acquisition made in December 2011 and growth in Highway Technologies commercial and heavy haul trailer products along with increased growth in projects for the Canadian Tar Sands area in the Water Treatment sector. These increases were partially offset by a decline in the Retail Store Fixtures sector due to reduced volume from its major customer, which resulted in a 14% decline in revenues. Retail Technologies’ pre-tax 2012 earnings were $262 million which represented an increase of 3% over 2011. The pre-tax earnings increase was primarily due to revenue growth in the Highway Technologies and Water Treatment sectors offset in part by the decline in the Retail Store Fixtures sector previously discussed. McLane Company Through McLane, we operate a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. Through its subsidiaries, McLane also operates as a wholesale distributor of distilled spirits, wine and beer. On August 24, 2012, McLane acquired Meadowbrook Meat Company, Inc. (“MBM”). MBM, based in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, is a large customized foodservice distributor for national restaurant chains with annual revenues of approximately $6 billion. MBM’s revenues and earnings are included in McLane’s results beginning as of the acquisition date. McLane’s grocery and foodservice businesses are marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins. McLane’s significant customers include Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven and Yum! Brands. Approximately 25% of McLane’s consolidated revenues in 2013 were attributable to Wal-Mart. A curtailment of purchasing by Wal-Mart or another of its significant customers could have a material adverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. 44 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) McLane Company (Continued) McLane’s revenues in 2013 were approximately $45.9 billion, representing an increase of approximately $8.5 billion (22.7%) over revenues in 2012. The increase in revenues in 2013 reflected the impact of MBM, as well as year-to-date revenue increases ranging from 10% to 15% in the grocery, other foodservice and beverage businesses. Revenues of each of these businesses in 2013 included the impact of new customers added over the past two years. McLane’s pre-tax earnings in 2013 increased $83 million (20.6%) over earnings in 2012. The increase in 2013 pre-tax earnings reflected the increases in revenues, including the impact of the MBM acquisition, and a gain from the sale of its Brazil-based logistics business, partially offset by slightly lower operating margins. McLane’s revenues were approximately $37.4 billion in 2012, an increase of about $4.2 billion (12.5%) over 2011. The increase in revenues was attributable to the MBM acquisition, as well as 6% to 8% revenue increases in McLane’s grocery, foodservice and beverage business units. The increases in grocery and foodservice revenues reflected manufacturer price increases as well as increased volume. Pre-tax earnings in 2012 were $403 million, an increase of $33 million (9%) over 2011. The overall increase in earnings reflected the increases in revenues as pre-tax margin rates were relatively unchanged. Other manufacturing Our other manufacturing businesses include several manufacturers of building products (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville, Shaw and MiTek) and apparel (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes Russell athletic apparel and Vanity Fair Brands women’s intimate apparel). Also included in this group are Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”), a specialty chemical manufacturer that we acquired on September 16, 2011, IMC International Metalworking Companies (“Iscar”), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide, Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehicles and CTB, a manufacturer of equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries. Other manufacturing revenues in 2013 increased $2.3 billion (8.7%) to $29.1 billion. Forest River generated revenues of $3.3 billion in 2013, a 24% increase over 2012. The increase reflected a 17% volume increase and higher average sales prices, attributable to price and product mix changes. Revenues in 2013 from our building products businesses increased 8% to about $9.6 billion. These businesses benefitted from the generally improved residential and commercial construction markets. Apparel revenues in 2013 increased 3.5% to about $4.3 billion. Our other businesses in this group produced revenues in 2013 of $11.9 billion in the aggregate, an increase of about 8% over 2012. Most of the increase in revenues of these other businesses was attributable to bolt-on acquisitions during the last two years. Pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses in 2013 were $3.6 billion, an increase of $289 million (8.7%) versus 2012. Increased earnings were generated by Forest River (32%), building products businesses (13%) and apparel businesses (25%) compared to 2012. Pre-tax earnings of Iscar and Lubrizol were roughly unchanged from 2012. In addition, bolt-on acquisitions during the last two years contributed to the overall increased earnings. Revenues of our other manufacturing businesses in 2012 were approximately $26.8 billion, an increase of approximately $5.6 billion (26%) over 2011. Excluding Lubrizol, revenues in 2012 grew 6% over 2011. Revenues of Forest River increased 27%, which was attributable to increased volume and average sales prices. Revenues from building products and apparel businesses increased 4% and 5%, respectively, as compared with 2011. However, revenues of Iscar and CTB (before the impact of bolt-on acquisitions) declined compared to 2011 as a result of weakness in demand, particularly in non-U.S. markets. Pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses were approximately $3.3 billion in 2012, an increase of $922 million (38%) over earnings in 2011. Excluding the impact of Lubrizol, earnings of our other manufacturing businesses in 2012 increased 6% compared to 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to increased earnings from building products, apparel and Forest River, partially offset by lower earnings from Iscar, CTB and Scott Fetzer. In 2012, our Shaw carpet and flooring business benefited from the impact of price increases at the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012, as well as from relatively stable raw material costs, which resulted in higher margins. Our apparel businesses benefitted from past pricing actions and stabilizing raw material costs. On the other hand, our other businesses that manufacture products that are primarily for commercial and industrial customers, particularly those with significant business in overseas markets, such as CTB and Iscar, were negatively impacted in 2012 by slowing economic conditions in certain of those markets. 45 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Other service Our other service businesses include NetJets, the world’s leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft. Among the other businesses included in this group are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor; Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings; Dairy Queen, which licenses and services a system of over 6,300 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; the Buffalo News; the BH Media Group (“BH Media”), which includes the Omaha World-Herald, as well as 29 other daily newspapers and numerous other publications; and businesses that provide management and other services to insurance companies. Revenues of our other service businesses in 2013 were $9.0 billion, an increase of $821 million (10%) over revenues in 2012. In 2013, revenues of NetJets increased $288 million (7.5%), driven by higher sales of fractional aircraft shares, while TTI’s revenues increased $255 million (11%) over 2012. Revenues of BH Media increased $207 million (66%), attributable to the impact of business acquisitions during the last two years. Pre-tax earnings of $1.1 billion in 2013 increased $130 million (13%) compared to 2012. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to BH Media, FlightSafety, TTI and NetJets. The earnings increase of BH Media was due to bolt-on acquisitions during the last two years. TTI’s earnings increased 10% in 2013 versus 2012, due to higher sales and changes in product mix. TTI continues to be impacted by price competition, which pressures overall gross sales margins. FlightSafety’s earnings increased 11% in 2013, reflecting increased training revenues and relatively unchanged operating expenses. In 2013, NetJets’ earnings increased 7% as improved flight operations margins, fractional sales margins and reduced net financing costs more than offset the increase in comparative aircraft value impairment charges. Revenues of our other service businesses in 2012 were approximately $8.2 billion, an increase of $737 million (10%) over 2011. The increase in revenues in 2012 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the BH Media Group and a comparative revenue increase from TTI, principally due to its bolt-on business acquisitions in 2012. Pre-tax earnings of $966 million in 2012 declined $11 million (1%) from earnings in 2011. Earnings of NetJets and FlightSafety in 2012 were relatively unchanged from 2011. Earnings of other service businesses in 2012 included earnings of the BH Media Group, which were more than offset by lower earnings from TTI due primarily to weaker customer demand and intensifying price competition over the past year. Retailing Our retailing operations consist of four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies; Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools; and Oriental Trading Company (“OTC”), a direct retailer of party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties, which we acquired on November 27, 2012. Revenues of our retailing businesses in 2013 were $4.3 billion, an increase of $573 million (15%) over 2012. Pre-tax earnings in 2013 of these businesses increased $70 million (23%) as compared to earnings in 2012. The comparative increases in revenues and earnings were primarily attributable to the inclusion of OTC for the full year in 2013. Otherwise, earnings of the home furnishings and jewelry retail groups increased in 2013, while earnings of Pampered Chef and See’s Candies declined. Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2012 from the retailing businesses increased $142 million (4%) and $5 million (2%), respectively, over revenues and earnings in 2011. Increased revenues from the home furnishings and jewelry businesses as well as the inclusion of OTC from its acquisition date were partially offset by lower revenues from Pampered Chef. Increased earnings of our home furnishings retailers were substantially offset by lower earnings from our jewelry businesses and Pampered Chef. 46 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Finance and Financial Products Our finance and financial products businesses include manufactured housing and finance (Clayton Homes), transportation equipment leasing (XTRA), furniture leasing (CORT) as well as various miscellaneous financing activities. A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 Manufactured housing and finance $ 3,199 $ 3,014 $ 2,932 $ 416 $ 255 $ 154 Furniture/transportation equipment leasing 772 753 739 165 148 155 Other 320 343 343 404 445 465 $ 4,291 $ 4,110 $ 4,014 Pre-tax earnings 985 848 774 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 328 291 258 $ 657 $ 557 $ 516 Clayton Homes’ revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2013 increased $185 million (6%) and $161 million (63%), respectively, compared to 2012. In 2013, Clayton Homes’ pre-tax earnings benefitted from increased home sales, lower loan loss provisions and an increase in net interest income, as lower interest expense more than offset reductions in interest income on loan portfolios. Home unit sales increased 9% in 2013. Loan loss provisions in 2013 were lower reflecting comparatively lower foreclosures volume and loss rates. Clayton Homes’ manufactured housing business continues to operate at a competitive disadvantage compared to traditional single family housing markets, which receive significant interest rate subsidies from the U.S. Government through government agency insured mortgages. For the most part, these subsidies are not available to factory built homes. Nevertheless, Clayton Homes remains the largest manufactured housing business in the United States and we believe that it will continue to operate profitably, even under the prevailing conditions. Clayton Homes’ pre-tax earnings in 2012 increased $101 million (66%) over earnings in 2011. Earnings in 2012 were impacted by the increased unit sales, which improved manufacturing and other operating efficiencies. Earnings also benefited from reduced insurance claims and a decline in credit losses. The decline in interest income on loan portfolios was more than offset by interest expense attributable to a decline in borrowings and lower interest rates. Pre-tax earnings of CORT and XTRA in 2013 increased $17 million (11%) to $165 million, as compared to 2012. The increase reflected increased lease revenues and earnings of XTRA, which benefitted from increases in working units and average rental rates, relatively stable operating expenses and a foreign currency related gain in 2013. Pre-tax earnings of CORT and XTRA in 2012 were $148 million, a decline of $7 million (5%) versus 2011. In 2012, CORT’s earnings increased over 2011 due to a 5% increase in rental income and relatively stable selling, general and administrative expenses, which improved operating margins. In 2012, earnings from XTRA declined primarily due to increased depreciation expense and lower foreign currency exchange gains. Other earnings include interest and dividends from a portfolio of fixed maturity and equity investments and our share of the earnings of a commercial mortgage servicing business in which we own a 50% interest. Other earnings previously included interest income from a relatively small number of long-held commercial real estate loans. These loans were repaid in full during the third and fourth quarters of 2012. In addition, other earnings includes income from interest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes on borrowings by a Berkshire financing subsidiary that are used to fund loans to Clayton Homes and from guaranty fees charged to NetJets. Corresponding expenses are included in Clayton Homes’ and NetJets’ results. Guaranty fees charged to NetJets were $11 million in 2013, $30 million in 2012 and $41 million in 2011 and interest spreads charged to Clayton Homes were $78 million in 2013, $90 million in 2012 and $100 million in 2011. 47 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows. Amounts are in millions. 2013 2012 2011 Investment gains/losses: Sales and other disposals Insurance and other $ 2,830 $ 1,288 $ 1,991 Finance and financial products 5 2 162 Other-than-temporary impairment losses (228 ) (337 ) (908 ) Other 1,458 509 29 4,065 1,462 1,274 Derivative gains/losses: Equity index put option contracts 2,843 997 (1,787 ) Credit default contracts (213 ) 894 (251 ) Other derivative contracts (22 ) 72 (66 ) 2,608 1,963 (2,104 ) Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 6,673 3,425 (830 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 2,336 1,198 (309 ) Net gains/losses $ 4,337 $ 2,227 $ (521 ) Investment gains/losses arise primarily from the sale or redemption of investments or when investments are carried at fair value with the periodic changes in fair values recorded in earnings. The timing of gains or losses from sales or redemptions can have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses usually have minimal impact on the periodic changes in our consolidated shareholders’ equity since most of our investments are recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical or predictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will have on our reported earnings. Although our management does not consider investment gains and losses in a given period as necessarily meaningful or useful in evaluating periodic earnings, we are providing information to explain the nature of such gains and losses when they are reflected in earnings. Pre-tax investment gains/losses in 2013 were $4,065 million. Investment gains in 2013 included approximately $2.1 billion related to our investments in General Electric and Goldman Sachs common stock warrants and Wrigley subordinated notes. Beginning in 2013, the unrealized gains or losses associated with the warrants were included in earnings. These warrants were exercised in October 2013 on a cashless basis in exchange for shares of General Electric and Goldman Sachs common stock with an aggregate value of approximately $2.4 billion. The Wrigley subordinated notes were repurchased for cash of $5.08 billion, resulting in a pre-tax investment gain of $680 million. Pre-tax investment gains were approximately $1.5 billion in 2012 and were primarily attributable to sales of equity securities. Investment gains in 2011 included aggregate pre-tax gains of $1.8 billion from the redemptions of our Goldman Sachs and General Electric preferred stock investments. In each of the three years ending December 31, 2013, we recognized OTTI losses on certain of our equity and fixed maturity investments. OTTI losses on fixed maturity investments were $228 million in 2013, $337 million in 2012 and $402 million in 2011, and substantially all of the losses related to our investments in Texas Competitive Electric Holdings (“TCEH”) bonds. In 2011, we also recognized aggregate OTTI losses of $506 million related to our investments in equity securities, a portion of which related to certain components of our Wells Fargo common stock investments. The OTTI losses on equity securities in 2011 averaged about 7.5% of the original cost of the impaired securities. In each case, the issuer had been profitable in recent periods and in some cases highly profitable. Although we have periodically recorded OTTI losses in earnings in each of the past three years, we continue to own certain of these securities. In cases where the market values of these investments have increased since the dates the OTTI losses were recorded in earnings, these increases are not reflected in earnings but are instead included in shareholders’ equity as a 48 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) component of accumulated other comprehensive income. When recorded, OTTI losses have no impact whatsoever on the asset values otherwise recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets or on our consolidated shareholders’ equity. In addition, the recognition of such losses in earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income does not necessarily indicate that sales are imminent or planned and sales ultimately may not occur for a number of years. Furthermore, the recognition of OTTI losses does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is permanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost. As of December 31, 2013, consolidated gross unrealized losses on our investments in equity and fixed maturity securities determined on an individual purchase lot basis were $289 million. We have concluded that as of December 31, 2013, such losses were not other than temporary. We consider several factors in determining whether or not impairments are deemed to be other than temporary, including the current and expected long-term business prospects and if applicable, the creditworthiness of the issuer, our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers and the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline. Derivative gains/losses primarily represent the changes in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contracts. Periodic changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying credit and equity markets. In 2013, our equity index put option contracts generated a pre-tax gain of $2.8 billion, which was due to changes in fair values of the contracts as a result of overall higher equity index values, favorable currency movements and modestly higher interest rate assumptions. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our remaining equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates, which begin in 2018, and will be based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts as of those dates. As of December 31, 2013, the intrinsic value of these contracts was approximately $1.7 billion and our recorded liability at fair value was approximately $4.7 billion. In 2012, we recorded pre-tax gains from our equity index put option contracts of approximately $1.0 billion. These gains were due to increased index values, foreign currency exchange rate changes and valuation adjustments on a small number of contracts where contractual settlements are determined differently than the standard determination of intrinsic value, partially offset by lower interest rate assumptions. In 2011, we recorded pre-tax losses of approximately $1.8 billion on our equity index put option contracts. The losses reflected declines ranging from about 5.5% to 17% with respect to three of the four equity indexes covered under our contracts and lower interest rate assumptions. Our credit default contracts generated pre-tax losses of $213 million in 2013, which was due to increases in estimated liabilities of a municipality issuer contract that relates to more than 500 municipal debt issues. Our credit default contract exposures associated with corporate issuers expired in December 2013. There were no losses paid in 2013. Our remaining credit default derivative contract exposures are currently limited to the municipality issuer contract. In 2012, we recognized pre-tax gains of $894 million on credit default contracts. Such gains were attributable to narrower spreads and reduced time exposure, as well as from settlements related to the termination of certain contracts. We recorded pre-tax losses of $251 million on our credit default contracts in 2011. The losses in 2011 were primarily related to our contracts involving non-investment grade corporate issuers due to widening credit default spreads and loss events. In 2012 and 2011, credit loss payments were $68 million and $86 million, respectively. Financial Condition Our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2013 was $221.9 billion, an increase of $34.24 billion since the beginning of the year. Our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2013 is net of a reduction of approximately $1.8 billion as a result of acquisitions of noncontrolling interests as discussed below and in Note 22 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Consolidated cash and investments of our insurance and other businesses approximated $199.2 billion (excludes our investments in H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation) at December 31, 2013, including cash and cash equivalents of $42.6 billion. As of December 31, 2013, our insurance subsidiaries held approximately $186.8 billion in cash and investments. 49 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) In 2013, we used cash of approximately $15 billion in the aggregate to fund Berkshire’s investments in H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (“Heinz Holding”) and to acquire certain noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries. On June 7, 2013, we invested $12.25 billion in Heinz Holding which acquired H.J. Heinz Company. Our investments in Heinz Holding consist of common stock, common stock warrants and preferred stock. Berkshire currently holds 50% of the voting interests in Heinz Holding. During 2013, Berkshire acquired noncontrolling interests of Marmon and International Metalworking Companies B.V., the parent company of Iscar. Cash paid in 2013 in connection with these acquisitions was approximately $2.9 billion and an additional $1.2 billion is payable in March 2014. On October 1, 2013, we received cash of approximately $5.1 billion in connection with Mars/Wrigley’s repurchase of our investment in Wrigley subordinated notes. In January 2013, Berkshire issued $2.6 billion of parent company senior unsecured notes with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2043. The proceeds were used to fund the repayment of $2.6 billion of notes that matured in February 2013. On January 1, 2014, Marmon completed its acquisition of the beverage dispensing and merchandising operations of British engineering company IMI plc for approximately $1.1 billion. The acquisition was funded with existing cash balances. Berkshire’s Board of Directors has authorized Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B common shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares at management’s discretion. The repurchase program is expected to continue indefinitely, but does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B common shares. Repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash and cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. There were no share repurchases during 2013. In December 2012, Berkshire acquired 9,475 Class A shares and 606,499 Class B shares for approximately $1.3 billion. On December 19, 2013, MidAmerican completed its acquisition of NV Energy, Inc. (“NV Energy”), an energy holding company serving electric and natural gas customers in Nevada. MidAmerican purchased all outstanding shares of NV Energy’s common stock for cash of approximately $5.6 billion. The acquisition was funded through a combination of cash provided by MidAmerican’s shareholders of $3.6 billion (including approximately $3.5 billion provided by Berkshire) and the issuance by MidAmerican of $2.0 billion of senior unsecured debt. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and MidAmerican) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make capital expenditures in the normal course of business. In 2013, aggregate capital expenditures of these businesses were $8.2 billion, including $4.3 billion by MidAmerican and $3.9 billion by BNSF. BNSF and MidAmerican have forecasted aggregate capital expenditures in 2014 of approximately $11.1 billion. Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations and debt issuances. In 2013, BNSF issued $3.0 billion in new debentures consisting of $1.5 billion of debentures due in 2023 and $1.5 billion of debentures due in 2043. BNSF’s outstanding debt was approximately $17.0 billion as of December 31, 2013. In 2013, MidAmerican and its subsidiaries issued new term debt of approximately $4.5 billion, including the new senior unsecured debt issued in funding the NV Energy acquisition, and repaid borrowings of approximately $2.0 billion. MidAmerican’s aggregate outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2013 were approximately $29.6 billion which includes approximately $5.3 billion of NV Energy’s debt. BNSF and MidAmerican have aggregate debt and capital lease maturities in 2014 of $2.1 billion. Berkshire’s commitment to provide up to $2 billion of additional capital to MidAmerican to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund its regulated utility subsidiaries expired on February 28, 2014 and has not been renewed. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, MidAmerican or any of their subsidiaries. Assets of the finance and financial products businesses, which consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, cash and cash equivalents and fixed maturity and equity investments, were approximately $26.2 billion and $25.4 billion as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. Liabilities were $19.0 billion as of December 31, 2013 and $22.1 billion as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2013, notes payable and other borrowings of finance and financial products businesses were $12.7 billion and included approximately $11.2 billion of notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). During 2013, BHFC issued $3.45 billion aggregate of new senior notes and repaid $3.45 billion of maturing senior notes. In January 2014, an additional $750 million of BHFC debt matured and was refinanced with a corresponding amount of new debt. We currently intend to issue additional new debt through BHFC to replace some or all of its upcoming debt maturities. The proceeds from the BHFC notes are used to finance originated loans and acquired loans of Clayton Homes. The full and timely payment of principal and interest on the BHFC notes is guaranteed by Berkshire. 50 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) As described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are party to equity index put option and credit default contracts. With limited exception, these contracts contain no collateral posting requirements under any circumstances, including changes in either the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts or a downgrade in Berkshire’s credit ratings. At December 31, 2013, the net liabilities recorded for such contracts were approximately $5.3 billion and we had no collateral posting requirements. We regularly access the credit markets, particularly through our railroad, utilities and energy and finance and financial products businesses. Restricted access to credit markets at affordable rates in the future could have a significant negative impact on our operations. In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Reform Act”) was signed into law. The Reform Act reshapes financial regulations in the United States by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and market participants and providing new enforcement powers to regulators. Virtually all major areas of the Reform Act have been subject to extensive rulemaking proceedings being conducted both jointly and independently by multiple regulatory agencies, some of which have been completed and others that are expected to be finalized during the next several months. Although the Reform Act may adversely affect some of our business activities, it is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as minimum rentals under operating leases, that are not currently reflected in the financial statements. Such obligations will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included in the following table to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date. The timing and/or amount of the payments under certain contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table that follows. Most significantly, the timing and amount of payments arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of claim settlement activities or events that may occur over many years. In addition, obligations arising under life, annuity and health insurance benefits are estimated based on assumptions as to future premiums, allowances, mortality, morbidity, expenses and policy lapse rates, as applicable. The amounts presented in the following table are based on the liability estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2013. Although certain insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and life, annuity and health benefits are ceded to others under reinsurance contracts, receivables recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are not reflected in the table below. A summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 follows. Amounts are in millions. Estimated payments due by period Total 2014 2015-2016 2017-2018 After 2018 Notes payable and other borrowings (1) $ 113,862 $ 8,789 $ 14,521 $ 17,510 $ 73,042 Operating leases 8,614 1,245 2,062 1,512 3,795 Purchase obligations 50,297 15,496 10,541 7,295 16,965 Losses and loss adjustment expenses (2) 66,732 14,412 14,914 8,434 28,972 Life, annuity and health insurance benefits (3) 21,390 1,436 78 179 19,697 Other (4) 20,768 5,304 1,496 1,190 12,778 Total $ 281,663 $ 46,682 $ 43,612 $ 36,120 $ 155,249 (1) Includes interest. (2) Before reserve discounts of $1,866 million. (3) Amounts represent estimated undiscounted benefit obligations net of estimated future premiums, as applicable. (4) Includes derivative contract liabilities. 51 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates are necessarily based on assumptions about numerous factors involving varying, and possibly significant, degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements, with the benefit of hindsight, will likely be adjusted in the future based on additional information made available and changes in other facts and circumstances. Property and casualty losses A summary of our consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Except for certain workers’ compensation liabilities, all liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as “gross unpaid losses”) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value, regardless of the length of the claim-tail. Amounts are in millions. Gross unpaid losses Net unpaid losses * Dec. 31, 2013 Dec. 31, 2012 Dec. 31, 2013 Dec. 31, 2012 GEICO $ 11,342 $ 10,300 $ 10,644 $ 9,791 General Re 15,668 15,961 14,664 14,740 BHRG 30,446 31,186 25,314 26,328 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 7,410 6,713 6,737 6,171 Total $ 64,866 $ 64,160 $ 57,359 $ 57,030 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges on reinsurance assumed and before foreign currency translation effects. We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts with respect to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of loss payments is subject to a great degree of variability and is contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the determination of the ultimate loss amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used in establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses. Regardless of the techniques used, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amounts payable in the future. As a result, uncertainties are imbedded in and permeate the actuarial loss reserving techniques and processes used. As of any balance sheet date, not all claims that have occurred have been reported and not all reported claims have been settled. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include provisions for reported claims (referred to as “case reserves”) and for claims that have not been reported (referred to as incurred but not yet reported (“IBNR”) reserves). The time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement payment date is referred to as the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within a few years of occurrence. Casualty losses usually have very long claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contributes to extending claim-tails. Receivables are recorded with respect to losses ceded to other reinsurers and are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses. In addition, reinsurance receivables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders. We utilize processes and techniques to establish liability estimates that are believed to best fit the particular business. Additional information regarding those processes and techniques of our significant insurance businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows. GEICO GEICO’s gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities as of December 31, 2013 were $11.3 billion, which included $8.0 billion of reported average, case and case development reserves and $3.3 billion of IBNR reserves. GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. Auto insurance claims generally have a relatively short claim-tail. The 52 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). Our reserving methodologies produce reserve estimates based upon the individual claims (or a “ground-up” approach), which yields an aggregate estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Ranges of loss estimates are not determined in the aggregate. Our actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserves using recognized standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The significant reserve components (and percentage of gross reserves as of December 31, 2013) are: (1) average reserves (15%), (2) case and case development reserves (60%) and (3) IBNR reserves (25%). Each component of loss reserves is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. Reserves are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, rated state, reporting date and occurrence date, among other ways. A brief discussion of each reserve component follows. We establish average reserve amounts for reported auto damage claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. The average reserves are intended to represent a reasonable estimate for incurred claims for claims when adjusters have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that are paid within a relatively short time after being reported. Average reserve amounts are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened. Our claims adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as soon as the specific facts and merits of each claim can be evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised over time as more information becomes known. For most liability coverages, case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim-tail, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is established. Therefore, we establish additional case development reserve estimates, which are usually percentages of the case reserve. As of December 31, 2013, case development reserves averaged approximately 25% of total established case reserves. In general, case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves. Case development factors are reviewed and revised periodically. For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are subtracted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established through the collaborative effort of actuarial, claims and other management personnel. For each significant coverage, we test the adequacy of the total loss reserves using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense estimates recorded at the end of 2012 developed downward by $238 million when reevaluated through December 31, 2013, producing a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2013. These downward reserve developments represented approximately 1.3% of earned premiums in 2013 and approximately 2.3% of prior year-end recorded liabilities. Reserving assumptions at December 31, 2013 were modified appropriately to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future reserve development will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated. 53 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Within the automobile line of business, reserves for liability coverages are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails. Approximately 92% of GEICO’s reserves as of December 31, 2013 were for automobile liability, of which bodily injury (“BI”) coverage accounted for approximately 55%. We believe it is reasonably possible that the average BI severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used. If actual BI severity changes one percentage point from what was used in establishing the reserves, our reserves would develop up or down by approximately $165 million resulting in a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to be different from expected would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. GEICO’s exposure to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining liabilities associated with such exposure are currently a relatively insignificant component of GEICO’s total reserves (approximately 1.3%) and there is minimal apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure. Related claim activity over the past year was insignificant. General Re and BHRG Liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses of our General Re and BHRG underwriting units derive primarily from assumed reinsurance. Additional uncertainties are unique to the processes used in estimating such reinsurance liabilities. The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which are affected by market conditions and practices) and other factors. Contract terms, conditions and coverages tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than under primary insurance policies. We are unable to reliably measure the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainties. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative, per occurrence excess or retroactive contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract. This occurs when our personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. However, loss information related to aggregate excess-of-loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Occasionally, loss information is reported in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is usually provided through periodic reports and may include the amount of ceded losses paid where reimbursement is sought as well as case loss reserve estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers. Each of our reinsurance businesses has established practices to identify and gather needed information from clients. These practices include, for example, comparison of expected premiums to reported premiums to help identify delinquent client reports and claim reviews to facilitate loss reporting and identify inaccurate or incomplete claim reporting. We periodically evaluate and modify these practices as conditions, risk factors and unanticipated areas of exposures are identified. The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is typically delayed in comparison with claim reporting to primary insurers. In some instances, multiple reinsurers assume and cede parts of an underlying risk thereby causing multiple contractual intermediaries between us and the primary insured. In these instances, the claim reporting delays are compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer varies depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms and other factors. Contracts covering casualty losses on a per occurrence excess basis may experience longer delays in reporting due to the length of the claim-tail as regards to the underlying claim. In addition, ceding companies may not report claims until they conclude it is reasonably possible that the reinsurer will be affected, usually determined as a function of its estimate of the claim amount as a percentage of the reinsurance contract retention. However, the timing of reporting large per occurrence excess property losses or property catastrophe losses may not vary significantly from primary insurance. Under contracts where periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies, such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals which in the U.S. range from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. Outside the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices vary. In certain countries, clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. The different client reporting practices generally do not result in a significant increase in risk or uncertainty as the actuarial reserving methodologies are adjusted to compensate for the delays. Premium and loss data is provided to us through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data provided is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding 54 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re and BHRG (Continued) companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Generally, we are permitted under the contracts to access the cedant’s books and records with respect to the subject business, thus providing us the ability to conduct audits to determine the accuracy and completeness of information. Audits are conducted as we deem appropriate. In the normal course of business, disputes with clients occasionally arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through the involvement of our claims department personnel and the appropriate client personnel or through independent outside counsel. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or an alternative dispute resolution process will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. General Re General Re’s gross and net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and gross reserves by major line of business as of December 31, 2013 are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Type Line of business Reported case reserves $ 7,809 Workers’ compensation (1) $ 2,830 IBNR reserves 7,859 Mass tort-asbestos/environmental 1,539 Gross reserves 15,668 Auto liability 3,769 Ceded reserves and deferred charges (1,004 ) Other casualty (2) 2,288 Net reserves $ 14,664 Other general liability 2,462 Property 2,780 Total $ 15,668 (1) Net of discounts of $1,866 million. (2) Includes directors and officers, errors and omissions, medical malpractice and umbrella coverage. General Re’s loss reserve estimation process is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (“ACRs”) and IBNR reserves. The critical processes in establishing loss reserves involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the determination of expected ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and the comparison of case reserve reporting trends to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded reserve amounts are subject to “tail risk” where reported losses develop beyond the maximum expected loss emergence time period. We do not routinely determine loss reserve ranges. We believe that the techniques necessary to make such determinations have not sufficiently developed and that the myriad of assumptions required render such resulting ranges to be unreliable. In addition, claim counts or average amounts per claim are not utilized because clients do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail. Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, our claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners’ estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners’ estimates are significantly greater than the ceding company’s estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACRs are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2013, ACRs aggregated approximately $2.2 billion before discounts and were concentrated in workers’ compensation reserves, and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. Our examiners also periodically conduct detailed claim reviews of individual clients and case reserves are often increased as a result. In 2013, we conducted 266 claim reviews. Our actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (“reserve cells”) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative and program) and line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, etc.). For each reserve cell, premiums and losses are aggregated by accident year, policy year or underwriting year (depending on client reporting practices) and analyzed over time. We internally refer to these loss aggregations as loss triangles, which serve as the primary basis for our IBNR reserve calculations. We review over 300 reserve cells for our North American business and approximately 900 reserve cells with respect to our international business. 55 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) We use loss triangles to determine the expected case loss emergence patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, loss triangles are further used to determine IBNR reserves. While additional calculations form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern, the determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly a mechanical process. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, we use estimation formulas along with reliance on other loss triangles and judgment. Factors affecting our loss development triangles include but are not limited to the following: changes in client claims practices, changes in claim examiners’ use of ACRs or the frequency of client company claim reviews, changes in policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. Collectively, these factors influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns. We select expected loss ratios by reserve cell, by accident year, based upon reviewing forecasted losses and indicated ultimate loss ratios that are predicted from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premium. If the selected emergence pattern is not accurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios may not be accurate, which can affect the selected loss ratios and hence the IBNR reserve. As with selected loss emergence patterns, selecting expected loss ratios is not a strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing loss ratios. We estimate IBNR reserves by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, our actuaries calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year. These calculations do not involve new assumptions and use the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year. In 2013, our reported claims for prior years’ workers’ compensation losses were less than expected by $238 million. However, further analysis of the workers’ compensation reserve cells by segment indicated the need for maintaining IBNR reserves. These developments precipitated a net increase of $112 million in nominal IBNR reserve estimates for unreported occurrences. After adjusting for the $126 million net increase in liabilities from changes in net reserve discounts during the year, the net increase in workers’ compensation losses from prior years’ occurrences had a minimal impact on pre-tax earnings in 2013. To illustrate the sensitivity of changes in expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios for our significant excess-of-loss workers’ compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves as of December 31, 2013 of approximately $795 million and $441 million on a discounted basis. The increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates. Our other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) developed favorably in 2013 relative to expectations. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given year means that loss reserve amounts currently established will continue to develop favorably. For our significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells (including medical malpractice, umbrella, auto and general liability), an increase of five points in the tails of the expected emergence patterns and an increase of five percent in expected loss ratios (one percent for large international proportional reserve cells) would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $978 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $978 million. In 2013, our property results included estimated losses incurred of $400 million from significant catastrophe events during the year. In 2013, reported claims for prior years’ property loss events were less than expected, and we reduced our estimated ultimate liabilities by $375 million. However, the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses. 56 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (“D&O and E&O”) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected emergence patterns. These cells often involve a spike in loss activity arising from recent industry developments making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern. For our large D&O and E&O reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern (for those cells where emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $153 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates. Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, “mass tort”) claims. Gross unpaid mass tort liabilities at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were approximately $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively and net of reinsurance, were approximately $1.2 billion at the end of each of the last two years. Mass tort net claims paid were $72 million in 2013. In 2013, ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims were increased by $30 million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider “survival ratios” based on average net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. The survival ratio based on claim payments made over the last three years was approximately 15.6 years as of December 31, 2013. The reinsurance industry’s survival ratio for asbestos and pollution reserves was approximately 14.5 years based on the three years ending December 31, 2012. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. BHRG BHRG’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2013 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions. Property Casualty Total Reported case reserves $ 2,090 $ 3,202 $ 5,292 IBNR reserves 2,542 4,896 7,438 Retroactive — 17,716 17,716 Gross reserves $ 4,632 $ 25,814 30,446 Deferred charges and ceded reserves (5,132 ) Net reserves $ 25,314 In general, the methodologies we use to establish loss reserves vary widely and encompass many of the common methodologies employed in the actuarial field today. Certain traditional methodologies such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques are utilized, as well as ground-up techniques where appropriate. Additional judgments must also be employed to consider changes in contract conditions and terms as well as the incidence of litigation or legal and regulatory change. Our gross loss reserves related to retroactive reinsurance policies were predominately for casualty or liability losses. Our retroactive policies relate to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date and include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses above a contractual retention are indemnified or contracts that indemnify all losses paid by the counterparty after the policy effective date. We paid retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses of approximately $1.3 billion in 2013. The classification “reported case reserves” has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since the amount is often derived from reports in bulk from ceding companies, who may have inconsistent definitions of “case reserves.” We review and establish loss reserve estimates, including estimates of IBNR reserves, in the aggregate by contract. In 2013, we increased reserves for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by approximately $300 million, which related primarily to asbestos and environmental risks assumed. 57 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG (Continued) In establishing retroactive reinsurance reserves, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. We assign judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, we reassess expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process. BHRG’s liabilities for environmental, asbestos and latent injury losses and loss adjustment expenses were approximately $11.9 billion at December 31, 2013 and $12.4 billion at December 31, 2012 and were concentrated within retroactive reinsurance contracts. We paid losses of approximately $874 million in 2013 attributable to these exposures. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not receive consistently reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, we conduct a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data of the reinsured to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, our estimates can only be developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. Potential legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on establishing loss reserves for mass tort claims in the future. We currently believe that maximum losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed approximately $35 billion due to the aggregate contract limits that are applicable to most of these contracts. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also believe it unlikely that our reported year end gross unpaid losses of $17.7 billion will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15%. Certain of our reinsurance contracts are expected to have a low frequency of claim occurrence combined with a potential for high severity of claims, such as property losses from catastrophes and aviation risks related to our catastrophe and individual risk business. Loss reserves related to catastrophe and individual risk contracts were approximately $800 million at December 31, 2013. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ events were reduced by about $200 million in 2013, which produced a corresponding increase in pre-tax earnings. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event. Other reinsurance reserves (approximately $11.9 billion as of December 31, 2013) consisted of a variety of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Liabilities as of December 31, 2013, included approximately $4.0 billion related to the 20% quota-share contract with Swiss Re, which is now in run-off. Reinsurance reserve amounts are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on a portfolio basis, supplemented by management’s judgment of the impact of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon management’s judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding company’s loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared. Derivative contract liabilities Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. Our most significant derivative contract exposures relate to equity index put option contracts written between 2004 and 2008. These contracts were entered into in over-the-counter markets. Certain elements of the terms and conditions of these contracts are not standard and we are not required to post collateral under most of these contracts. Furthermore, there is no source of independent data available to us showing trading volume and actual prices of completed transactions. As a result, the values of these liabilities are based on valuation models that we believe would be used by market participants. Such models or other valuation techniques use inputs that are observable in the marketplace, while others are unobservable. Unobservable inputs require us to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in establishing 58 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Derivative contract liabilities (Continued) prices. We believe that the fair values produced for long-duration options is inherently subjective. The values of contracts in an actual exchange are affected by market conditions and perceptions of the buyers and sellers. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model. We determine the estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts using a Black-Scholes based option valuation model. Inputs to the model include the current index value, strike price, interest rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted average interest and dividend rates used as of December 31, 2013 were 2.5% and 3.6%, respectively, and were approximately 2.1% and 3.3%, respectively, as of December 31, 2012. The interest rates as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were approximately 64 basis points and 95 basis points (on a weighted average basis), respectively, over benchmark interest rates and represented our estimate of our nonperformance risk. We believe that the most significant economic risks under these contracts relate to changes in the index value component and, to a lesser degree, the foreign currency component. The Black-Scholes based model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. Our contracts have an average remaining maturity of about 7 years. The weighted average volatility used as of December 31, 2013 was approximately 20.7%, compared to 20.9% as of December 31, 2012. The weighted average volatilities are based on the volatility input for each equity index put option contract weighted by the notional value of each equity index put option contract as compared to the aggregate notional value of all equity index put option contracts. The volatility input for each equity index put option contract reflects our expectation of future price volatility. The impact on fair value as of December 31, 2013 ($4.7 billion) from changes in the volatility assumption is summarized in the table that follows. Dollars are in millions. Hypothetical change in volatility (percentage points) Hypothetical fair value Increase 2 percentage points $ 5,067 Increase 4 percentage points 5,479 Decrease 2 percentage points 4,284 Decrease 4 percentage points 3,923 For several years, we also have had exposures relating to a number of credit default contracts written involving corporate and state/municipality issuers. During 2013, all credit default contracts involving corporate issuers expired and at December 31, 2013, our remaining exposures relate to state/municipality exposures which begin to expire in 2019. The fair values of our state/municipality contracts are generally based on bond pricing data on the underlying bond issues and credit spread estimates. We monitor and review pricing data and spread estimates for consistency as well as reasonableness with respect to current market conditions. We make no significant adjustments to the pricing data or inputs obtained. Prices in a current market trade involving identical (or sufficiently similar) risks and contract terms as our equity index put option or credit default contracts could differ significantly from the fair values used in the financial statements. We do not operate as a derivatives dealer and currently do not utilize offsetting strategies to hedge our equity index put option or credit default contracts. We currently intend to allow these contracts to run off to their respective expiration dates. Other Critical Accounting Policies We record deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over the consideration received. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. Deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of remaining loss payments. Adjustments to deferred charge balances resulting from changes to these assumptions are determined retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were approximately $4.35 billion at December 31, 2013. Significant changes in the estimated amount and the timing of payments of unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization. 59 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Other Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) Our Consolidated Balance Sheet includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $57.0 billion, which includes approximately $2.7 billion associated with our various acquisitions in 2013. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2013. Our review includes determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then, as required by GAAP, we estimate the fair values of the individual assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Interest Rate Risk We regularly invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire such securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur with respect to assets. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We strive to maintain high credit ratings so that the cost of our debt is minimized. We rarely utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate instruments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate instruments. The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that there are no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to 60 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Interest Rate Risk (Continued) prepayment options available to the issuer. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Equity Price Risk Historically, we have maintained large amounts of invested assets in exchange traded equity securities. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices and prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2013, approximately 55% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated within four companies. We often hold equity investments for long periods of time so we are not troubled by short-term price volatility with respect to our investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. We strive to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate potential loss with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, fair values of these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract. These contracts expire between 2018 and 2026 and may not be unilaterally settled before their respective expiration dates. 61 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Equity Price Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes our equity and other investments and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. The effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates are also shown. The selected 30% hypothetical changes do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

Foreign Currency Risk We generally do not use derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency price changes primarily because of the natural hedging that occurs between assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies such as The Coca-Cola Company that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. Our net assets subject to translation are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy businesses, and to a lesser extent in our manufacturing and services businesses. The translation impact is somewhat offset by transaction gains or losses on net reinsurance liabilities of certain U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies as well as the equity index put option liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries relating to contracts that would be settled in foreign currencies. Commodity Price Risk Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We utilize derivative contracts to a limited degree in managing commodity price risks, most notably at MidAmerican. MidAmerican’s exposures to commodities include variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold and natural gas supply for customers. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage and transmission and transportation constraints. To mitigate a portion of the risk, MidAmerican uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Financial results would be negatively impacted 62 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Commodity Price Risk (Continued) if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. MidAmerican also uses futures, options and swap agreements to economically hedge gas and electric commodity prices for physical delivery to non-regulated customers. The table that follows summarizes our commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of MidAmerican as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of each date.

Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guaranties of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane or act of terrorism that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. 63 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 65.

Our operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance practices, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate “tone at the top” messages to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting in each of the last three years, including $1.7 billion in 2014. Periodic earnings from insurance underwriting are significantly impacted by the magnitude of catastrophe loss events occurring during the period. In 2014, we did not incur any losses from significant catastrophe events, compared to after-tax losses of approximately $285 million in 2013 and $725 million in 2012. Our railroad business earnings increased 2.0% in 2014, although earnings were negatively impacted by various service-related challenges during the year. Earnings from our railroad business in 2013 exceeded 2012 by 12.5% driven by increased volume over the network. Earnings of our utilities and energy businesses in 2014 exceeded 2013 by 28.0%, due to the acquisition of NV Energy in December 2013 and higher earnings from several of our other energy businesses. Earnings from utility and energy businesses in 2013 exceeded 2012 by 11.1%. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2014 increased 15.2% over 2013, which increased 15.5% over 2012. These increases reflected the impact of bolt-on business acquisitions, earnings growth in certain operations and reductions in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. “Other” in the preceding table includes after-tax earnings from our investments in Heinz Holdings of $652 million in 2014 and $95 million in 2013. After-tax investment and derivative gains were approximately $3.3 billion in 2014, $4.3 billion in 2013 and $2.2 billion in 2012. In each year, after-tax gains included gains from the reductions in estimated liabilities under equity index put option contracts and dispositions of investments, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairment charges. In 2014, after-tax gains included approximately $2.0 billion related to the exchanges of Phillips 66 (in the first quarter) and Graham Holdings Company (in the second quarter) common stocks for a specified subsidiary of each of those companies. After-tax investment gains in 2013 included gains associated with the fair value increases of certain investment securities where unrealized gains or losses were reflected in periodic earnings. In 2012, after-tax investment and derivative gains also included gains from settlements and expirations of credit default contracts. We believe that investment and derivatives gains/losses are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance. These gains and losses have caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 32 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing decisions, with limited exceptions, are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to BHRG and General Re. For the purpose of this discussion, we consider catastrophe losses significant if the pre-tax losses incurred from a single event (or series of related events such as tornadoes) exceed $100 million on a consolidated basis. In 2014, we did not incur any significant catastrophe losses. In 2013, we incurred pre-tax losses of $436 million related to two catastrophe events in Europe. In 2012, we incurred pre-tax losses of approximately $1.1 billion attributable to Hurricane Sandy. Our periodic underwriting results may be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. Actual claim settlements and revised loss estimates will develop over time, which will likely differ from the liability estimates recorded as of year-end (approximately $71.5 billion). Accordingly, the unpaid loss estimates recorded as of December 31, 2014 may develop upward or downward in future periods, producing a corresponding decrease or increase to pre-tax earnings. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rate changes produced pre-tax gains in 2014 and losses in 2013 and 2012. Historically, currency exchange rates have been volatile and the resulting impact on our underwriting earnings has been relatively significant. These gains and losses are included in underwriting expenses. A key marketing strategy of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. A measure of capital strength is combined shareholders’ equity determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules (“Statutory Surplus”). Statutory Surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $129 billion at December 31, 2014. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers. Underwriting results from our insurance businesses are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. 2014 2013 2012 Underwriting gain attributable to: GEICO $ 1,159 $ 1,127 $ 680 General Re 277 283 355 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 606 1,294 304 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 626 385 286 Pre-tax underwriting gain 2,668 3,089 1,625 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 976 1,094 579 Net underwriting gain $ 1,692 $ 1,995 $ 1,046 33 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO Through GEICO, we primarily write private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO’s policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. This is a significant element in our strategy to be a low-cost auto insurer. In addition, we strive to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICO’s underwriting results are summarized below. Dollars are in millions. 2014 2013 2012 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 20,962 $ 19,083 $ 17,129 Premiums earned $ 20,496 100.0 $ 18,572 100.0 $ 16,740 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 15,924 77.7 14,255 76.7 12,700 75.9 Underwriting expenses 3,413 16.6 3,190 17.2 3,360 20.0 Total losses and expenses 19,337 94.3 17,445 93.9 16,060 95.9 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 1,159 $ 1,127 $ 680 Premiums written and earned in 2014 were approximately $21.0 billion and $20.5 billion, respectively, which represented increases of 9.8% and 10.4%, respectively compared to premiums written and earned in 2013. These increases were attributable to an increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force of 6.6% during the past twelve months and increased average premium per policy. Voluntary auto new business sales increased about 1.8% in 2014 as compared to 2013. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2014 were approximately 821,000 higher than at December 31, 2013. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2014 increased $1.7 billion (11.7%) to $15.9 billion. The ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) was 77.7% in 2014 compared to 76.7% in 2013. In 2014, claims frequencies for property damage and collision coverages increased in the three to four percent range over 2013, partially due to more severe winter weather in the first quarter of 2014. Claims frequencies for bodily injury coverage increased about one percent, while frequencies for personal injury protection decreased three to four percent. Physical damage severities increased one to two percent in 2014 and bodily injury severities decreased in the one to two percent range from severities in 2013. Overall, personal injury protection severities were relatively flat although we experienced relatively large, but offsetting, changes by jurisdiction. In both 2014 and 2013, losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred were favorably impacted by reductions of estimates for prior years’ losses. Underwriting expenses in 2014 increased $223 million (7.0%) to $3.4 billion. The increase reflected the increased policy acquisition costs to generate the growth in policies-in-force and increased other operating expenses. The ratio of underwriting expenses to premiums earned (the “expense ratio”) was 16.6% in 2014 and 17.2% in 2013. Premiums written in 2013 were $19.1 billion, an increase of 11.4% over premiums written in 2012. Premiums earned in 2013 increased approximately $1.8 billion (10.9%) to approximately $18.6 billion. The growth in premiums reflected an increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force of 7.8% and to a lesser degree, higher average premiums per policy. The increase in policies-in-force reflected a 12.1% increase in voluntary auto new business sales. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2013 were approximately 898,000 greater than at December 31, 2012. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2013 increased $1.6 billion (12.2%) to $14.3 billion. The loss ratio was 76.7% in 2013 compared to 75.9% in 2012. In 2013, claims frequencies for property damage and collision coverages generally increased in the two to four percent range and physical damage claims severities increased in the three to four percent range as compared to 2012. In addition, average bodily injury claims frequencies increased in the one to two percent range. Bodily injury claims severities increased in the one to three percent range, although severities for personal injury protection coverage declined, primarily in Florida. In 2012, we incurred losses of approximately $490 million related to Hurricane Sandy. In both 2013 and 2012, losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred were favorably impacted by reductions of estimates for prior years’ losses. Underwriting expenses incurred in 2013 declined $170 million (5.1%) to $3.2 billion. Underwriting expenses in 2012 were impacted by a change in U.S. GAAP concerning deferred policy acquisition costs. Excluding the effects of the accounting change, the expense ratio in 2013 declined by approximately 0.4 percentage points from 2012. 34 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) General Re Through General Re, we conduct a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. We write property and casualty reinsurance in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Germany-based General Reinsurance AG and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written in broker markets through Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG. General Re strives to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines. Our management does not evaluate underwriting performance based upon market share and our underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Re’s underwriting results are summarized in the following table. Amounts are in millions. Premiums written Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 Property/casualty $ 3,257 $ 2,972 $ 2,982 $ 3,103 $ 3,007 $ 2,904 $ 170 $ 148 $ 399 Life/health 3,161 2,991 3,002 3,161 2,977 2,966 107 135 (44 ) $ 6,418 $ 5,963 $ 5,984 $ 6,264 $ 5,984 $ 5,870 $ 277 $ 283 $ 355 Property/casualty Property/casualty premiums written and earned in 2014 increased $285 million (9.6%) and $96 million (3.2%), respectively, compared to 2013. Adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the increases in premiums written and earned in 2014 were $246 million (8.3%) and $100 million (3.3%), respectively. The increases were primarily due to treaty participations as well as growth in our facultative and primary casualty businesses. Our underwriters continue to exercise discipline by declining business where prices are deemed inadequate and remain prepared to increase premium volume when appropriate prices are attained relative to the risks assumed. Our combined property/casualty business produced pre-tax underwriting gains in 2014 of $170 million compared to $148 million in 2013. In 2014 and 2013, our property business generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $466 million and $153 million, respectively. Underwriting results in 2014 reflected no significant catastrophe events as compared to 2013 which included $400 million of catastrophe losses primarily attributable to a hailstorm ($280 million) and floods ($120 million) in Europe. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual losses has produced and is expected to continue to produce significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. In both periods, property results also benefitted from reductions of estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ exposures. The favorable development in each period was primarily attributable to lower than expected losses reported from ceding companies. Our casualty/workers’ compensation business produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $296 million in 2014 as compared to $5 million in 2013. Casualty/workers’ compensation underwriting results included gains from reductions of estimated ultimate losses on prior years’ business of $123 million in 2014 and $354 million in 2013. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given period means that the ultimate liability estimates currently established will continue to develop favorably. The pre-tax underwriting losses in each year also reflected recurring charges related to discount accretion on workers’ compensation liabilities and amortization of deferred charges pertaining to retroactive reinsurance contracts. These charges aggregated $138 million in 2014 and $141 million in 2013. Property/casualty premiums written in 2013 were relatively unchanged while premiums earned increased $103 million (3.5%) when compared to 2012. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written and earned in 2013 increased $8 million (0.3%) and $83 million (2.9%), respectively, versus 2012. This was primarily due to increases in European treaty business. Our combined property/casualty operations generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $148 million in 2013 and $399 million in 2012. Property underwriting gains in 2013 were $153 million, a decline of $199 million from 2012. Property results in 2013 included $400 million of catastrophe losses primarily from a storm and floods in Europe while results in 2012 included $266 million of catastrophe losses, which were primarily attributable to Hurricane Sandy ($226 million). In each year, property results also benefitted from reductions of estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ business. In 2013, casualty/workers’ compensation business generated an underwriting loss of $5 million compared to an underwriting gain of $47 million in 2012. In each year, results benefitted from lower than expected losses from prior years’ casualty business. Underwriting results also included charges for discount accretion on workers’ compensation liabilities and deferred charge amortization of $141 million in 2013 and $158 million in 2012. 35 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) General Re (Continued) Life/health Premiums written and earned in 2014 increased $170 million (5.7%) and $184 million (6.2%), respectively, compared to 2013. Adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums written in 2014 increased $217 million (7.3%) over 2013 and premiums earned were $234 million (7.9%) higher than 2013. These increases primarily derived from life business across a number of non-U.S. markets. Premiums written in 2013 decreased $11 million (0.4%), while premiums earned increased $11 million (0.4%) compared with 2012. Adjusting for the effects of currency exchange rate changes, premiums written in 2013 increased $9 million (0.3%) over 2012 and premiums earned in 2013 were $32 million (1.1%) greater than 2012. The increases were primarily attributable to increased non-U.S. life business. Our life/health operations produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $107 million in 2014 compared to $135 million in 2013. In 2014, we increased reserves by approximately $50 million as a result of reducing discount rates for certain European long-term care and disability business. In 2014, we also experienced increased frequency and severity of claims in Australian disability business. Life/health pre-tax underwriting gains in 2013 were driven by lower than expected mortality. Underwriting results for 2012 were negatively impacted by a premium deficiency reserve that was established on the run-off of the U.S. long-term care business as well as greater than expected claims on Australian disability business. Underwriting results in all three years also reflected charges attributable to the periodic discount accretion on U.S. long-term care liabilities. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group Through BHRG, we underwrite excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages on property and casualty risks for insurers and reinsurers worldwide, including property catastrophe insurance and reinsurance. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce extraordinary volatility in the periodic underwriting results. BHRG also writes retroactive reinsurance, which provides indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events arising under property/casualty coverages. BHRG’s underwriting activities also include life reinsurance and annuity businesses. BHRG’s underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in millions. Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain/loss 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 Property/casualty $ 4,064 $ 5,149 $ 6,122 $ 1,684 $ 1,236 $ 695 Retroactive reinsurance 3,371 328 717 (905 ) (321 ) (201 ) Life and annuity 2,681 3,309 2,833 (173 ) 379 (190 ) $ 10,116 $ 8,786 $ 9,672 $ 606 $ 1,294 $ 304 Property/casualty Premiums earned in 2014 were $4,064 million, a decline of $1,085 million (21%) compared to 2013. Premiums earned in 2014 with respect to a 20% quota-share contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. (“Swiss Re”) declined $1.3 billion from premiums earned in 2013. This contract expired at the end of 2012 and is in run-off. Property catastrophe premiums earned in 2014 were $688 million, a decline of $113 million (14%) as compared to 2013. Our volume with respect to these coverages continues to be constrained, as rates, in our view, are inadequate. However, we have the capacity and desire to write substantially more business when appropriate pricing can be obtained. These declines were partially offset by increased premiums earned from property quota-share contracts. The property/casualty business generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $1.7 billion in 2014 compared to $1.2 billion in 2013. There were no losses from significant catastrophe events during 2014. Our property business, including property catastrophe business, generated pre-tax underwriting gains of approximately $700 million in 2014 compared to underwriting gains of about $800 million in 2013. The Swiss Re quota-share contract produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $283 million in 2014 and $351 million in 2013, primarily attributable to reductions in estimates of ultimate liabilities for prior years’ losses. BHRG’s underwriting results can be significantly impacted by foreign currency transaction gains or losses associated with certain reinsurance liabilities of U.S.-based subsidiaries (primarily arising under retroactive reinsurance contracts), which are denominated in foreign currencies. Underwriting results included foreign currency exchange rate gains of $315 million in 2014 compared to losses of $28 million in 2013. 36 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) Premiums earned from property/casualty business in 2013 declined $973 million (16%) compared to 2012. Premiums earned in 2013 from the Swiss Re quota-share contract were approximately $1.5 billion in 2013 compared to $3.4 billion in 2012. Property catastrophe premiums earned in 2013 aggregated $801 million, a decline of 2% versus 2012. Premiums earned in 2013 from other property/casualty business, increased $981 million (52%) over 2012, which was primarily attributable to increased property quota-share business. BHRG’s property/casualty business generated a pre-tax underwriting gain of $695 million in 2012. Underwriting results in 2012 included losses incurred of $364 million attributable to Hurricane Sandy. Underwriting results in 2012 also included foreign currency transaction losses of $123 million. Retroactive reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events, and related claims are generally expected to be paid over long periods of time. Premiums and limits of indemnification are often very large in amount. At the inception of a contract, deferred charge assets are recorded for the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate losses payable over the premiums earned. Deferred charges are subsequently amortized over the estimated claims payment period using the interest method, which reflects estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments. The original estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments are periodically analyzed against actual experience and revised based on an actuarial evaluation of the expected remaining losses. Amortization charges and deferred charge adjustments resulting from changes to the estimated timing and amount of future loss payments are included in periodic earnings. On July 17, 2014, National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), the lead insurance entity of BHRG, entered into a retroactive reinsurance agreement with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (“LMIC”). The agreement provides that NICO reinsure substantially all of LMIC’s unpaid losses and allocated loss adjustment expense liabilities related to (a) asbestos and environmental claims from policies incepting prior to 2005 and (b) workers’ compensation claims occurrences arising prior to January 1, 2014, in excess of an aggregate retention of approximately $12.5 billion and subject to an aggregate limit of $6.5 billion. The premiums earned in 2014 and the consideration paid to NICO with respect to this contract was approximately $3.0 billion. Underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance policies were $905 million in 2014, $321 million in 2013 and $201 million in 2012. In each year, underwriting losses included deferred charge amortization. In addition, underwriting results were impacted in 2014 and 2013 by increases in the estimated ultimate liabilities related to these policies, partially offset by increases in related deferred charge balances. In 2014, we increased estimated ultimate liabilities for contracts written in prior years by approximately $825 million, substantially all of which was recorded in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we increased ultimate liability estimates on remaining asbestos claims and re-estimated the timing of future payments of such liabilities as a result of actuarial analysis. The increase in ultimate liabilities, net of related deferred charge adjustments, produced incremental pre-tax underwriting losses in the fourth quarter of approximately $500 million. Gross unpaid losses from retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $24.3 billion at December 31, 2014, $17.7 billion at December 31, 2013 and $18.0 billion at December 31, 2012. Unamortized deferred charges related to BHRG’s retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $7.7 billion at December 31, 2014, $4.25 billion at December 31, 2013 and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2012. The increases in unpaid losses and unamortized deferred charges during 2014 were primarily related to the LMIC contract. As previously indicated, deferred charge balances will be charged to pre-tax earnings in the future. Life and annuity Life and annuity premiums earned in 2014 declined $628 million (19%) compared to premiums earned in 2013. The decline was primarily attributable to a 22% decline in premiums earned from annuity contracts and also from two unusually large transactions in 2013 which produced net premiums of approximately $400 million. The two transactions were as follows: (1) a new variable annuity guarantee contract, which produced premiums earned of $1.7 billion, and (2) an amendment of an existing yearly renewable term life reinsurance contract with Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc. (“SRLHA”), which resulted in return premiums of about $1.3 billion. The SRLHA contract amendment essentially commuted coverage with respect to a number of the underlying contracts in exchange for payments to SRLHA of approximately $675 million. 37 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Life and annuity (Continued) Life and annuity premiums earned in 2013 increased $476 million (17%) over premiums earned in 2012. The increase in 2013 was primarily attributable to the aforementioned new variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contract and the reversal of premiums under the SRLHA contract as a result of the contract amendment. Premiums earned in 2013 and 2012 also included $1.4 billion and $794 million, respectively, from traditional annuity insurance and reinsurance contracts. The life and annuity business produced a pre-tax loss of $173 million in 2014, a pre-tax gain of $379 million in 2013 and a pre-tax loss in 2012 of $190 million. Before foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses, this business generated a pre-tax loss of $275 million in 2014, a pre-tax gain of $442 million in 2013 and a pre-tax loss of $174 million in 2012. Structured settlement and traditional annuity contracts generated underwriting losses of $299 million in 2014, $151 million in 2013, and $143 million in 2012 before foreign currency effects. Generally, all of the premiums under these contracts are received at inception and payments are made over time, often extending for decades. These underwriting losses were primarily attributable to the recurring impact of the accretion of discounted annuity liabilities. Aggregate annuity liabilities were approximately $7.1 billion at December 31, 2014, $5.7 billion at December 31, 2013 and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2012. The life and annuity business also included pre-tax gains of $47 million in 2014 and $256 million in 2013 from variable annuity guarantee contracts. The gains were primarily attributable to the impact of rising equity markets which lowered estimates of liabilities for guaranteed minimum benefits. Periodic results from these contracts can be volatile reflecting changes in returns in investment markets, which impact the underlying insured exposures. In 2013, life and annuity underwriting results included a one-time pre-tax gain of $255 million related to the aforementioned amendment to the SRLHA reinsurance contract. This one-time gain occurred as the reversal of premiums earned was more than offset by the reversal of life benefits incurred. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses. These businesses include: Medical Protective Company and Princeton Insurance Company, providers of healthcare malpractice insurance coverages; National Indemnity Company’s primary group (“NICO Primary”), writers of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to as Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), providers of commercial multi-line insurance, including workers’ compensation; Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and Medicare Supplement insurance; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers’ compensation solutions; BoatU.S., a writer of insurance for owners of boats and small watercraft; and Berkshire Hathaway Guard Insurance Companies (“Guard”), providers of workers’ compensation and commercial property and casualty insurance coverage to small and mid-sized businesses. In the second quarter of 2013, we formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), which concentrates on providing large scale insurance solutions for commercial property and casualty risks. Premiums earned in 2014 and 2013 aggregated $4.4 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. The increase in premiums was primarily attributable to volume increases from BH Specialty, NICO Primary, BHHC and Guard. Premiums earned in 2013 by BH Primary increased $1,079 million (48%) over 2012. The comparative increase in 2013 reflected the impact of the Guard acquisition in 2012. In addition, BHHC’s premiums earned increased $301 million in 2013 as compared to 2012, due primarily to significantly higher workers’ compensation insurance volume. The BH Primary insurers produced aggregate pre-tax underwriting gains of $626 million in 2014, $385 million in 2013 and $286 million in 2012. Combined loss ratios were 60% in 2014 and in 2013 and 58% in 2012. Overall, the claim environment over the past three years has been favorable. However, these primary insurers write sizable amounts of liability and workers’ compensation business, which can have extended claim tails. It should not be assumed that the current claim experience or underwriting results will continue into the future. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income generated by our insurance operations follows. Amounts are in millions. 2014 2013 2012 Investment income before taxes and noncontrolling interests $ 4,357 $ 4,713 $ 4,454 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 815 1,005 1,057 Net investment income $ 3,542 $ 3,708 $ 3,397 38 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Investment income consists of interest and dividends earned on investments held by our insurance businesses. Pre-tax investment income in 2014 was $4,357 million, representing a decline of $356 million (8%) versus 2013. The decline was attributable to lower interest income from fixed maturity securities, partially offset by increased dividend income from equity securities. The reduction in interest income reflected the maturities and dispositions during the last two years of several fixed maturity securities with higher interest rates, including $4.4 billion par amount of Wrigley 11.45% subordinated notes as a result of the repurchase of those notes by the issuer in 2013. Our insurance businesses continue to hold significant cash and cash equivalent balances (approximately $42.8 billion as of December 31, 2014) earning very low yields. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to cash and cash equivalents. The increase in dividends earned reflected higher dividend rates for certain of our equity holdings. Beginning in 2015, investment income will include dividends from our investment in Restaurant Brands International, Inc. Preferred Stock ($3 billion stated value). Pre-tax investment income in 2013 increased $259 million (5.8%) compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to increased dividend income on equity investments, which reflected increased dividend rates for certain of our larger equity holdings as well as increased overall investments in equity securities. Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $84 billion at December 31, 2014, $77 billion at December 31, 2013, and $73 billion at December 31, 2012. The cost of float was negative over the last three years as our insurance business generated pre-tax underwriting gains in each year. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 follows. Other investments include investments in The Dow Chemical Company, Bank of America Corporation and Restaurant Brands International, Inc.

BNSF’s major business groups are classified by type of product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. Earnings of BNSF are summarized below (in millions). 2014 2013 2012 Revenues $ 23,239 $ 22,014 $ 20,835 Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 5,023 4,651 4,505 Fuel 4,478 4,503 4,459 Purchased services 2,592 2,418 2,374 Depreciation and amortization 2,123 1,973 1,889 Equipment rents, materials and other 2,021 1,812 1,608 Total operating expenses 16,237 15,357 14,835 Interest expense 833 729 623 17,070 16,086 15,458 Pre-tax earnings 6,169 5,928 5,377 Income taxes 2,300 2,135 2,005 Net earnings $ 3,869 $ 3,793 $ 3,372 Consolidated revenues in 2014 were approximately $23.2 billion, representing an increase of $1.2 billion (5.6%) over 2013. The overall year-to-date increase in revenues reflected a 1.8% increase in cars/units handled and a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit. In 2014, our combined volume was approximately 10.3 million cars/units. Our rail operations were negatively affected by severe winter weather conditions during the first quarter of 2014, particularly in the Northern U.S. service territory as well as from various other service issues throughout 2014. These issues resulted in slower average speeds on our system and negatively impacted volumes and revenues of each of our business groups. We experienced improvement in operating performance and freight volumes over the fourth quarter of 2014. Nevertheless, our service levels at the end of 2014 were well below our internal standards, as well as those expected by our customers. We continue to work diligently to address service issues without compromising safety. We added capacity in 2014 through capital investments for line expansion, system improvement projects, additional equipment and new employee hires. We plan to continue these initiatives in 2015 in order to meet customer demand and improve and maintain service levels. Revenues from consumer products in 2014 were $7.0 billion, and were relatively unchanged from 2013. In 2014, unit volume and average revenues per car were relatively flat versus 2013. In 2014, our international intermodal business volume was negatively affected by congestion at U.S. West Coast ports. Should these conditions persist, our volumes in 2015 may suffer. In 2014, revenues from industrial products increased $508 million (9%) to $6.2 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases in overall unit volume, and to a lesser extent, changes in rates and product mix. Revenues from agricultural products in 2014 increased $584 million (16%) to approximately $4.2 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to increased volume, rates and product mix changes. Also, agricultural products volume in 2013 was negatively affected by the drought conditions in 2012. In 2014, coal revenues of $5.0 billion were essentially unchanged from 2013, as a 2% increase in year-to-date unit volume was offset by a 2% decline in average rates. Operating expenses in 2014 were $16.2 billion, representing an increase of $880 million (6%) over 2013. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $372 million (8%) in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to increased employment levels, and to a lesser extent, wage inflation and higher overtime. Fuel expenses were relatively unchanged compared to 2013. The favorable impact from lower average fuel prices was largely offset by higher volumes. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $150 million (8%) as a result of additional assets in service. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $209 million (12%) compared to 2013 as a result of higher crew transportation and other travel costs, and increased costs of utilities. Consolidated revenues in 2013 were approximately $22.0 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion (5.7%) over 2012. The overall increase in revenues reflected a 4.5% increase in cars/units handled and a slight increase in average revenue per car/unit, attributable to rates. In 2013, BNSF generated higher revenues from industrial products, consumer products and coal, partially offset by lower revenues from agricultural products. 40 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) In 2013, industrial products revenues of $5.7 billion increased 14% versus 2012, driven by an 11% increase in volume, reflecting significantly higher petroleum products volumes. Consumer products revenues were $7.0 billion, an increase of 6% over 2012 that was primarily attributable to volume increases from domestic intermodal business and higher export demand. Coal revenues were $5.0 billion, an increase of 2.6% over 2012, which was attributable to increased volume. The volume increase reflected increased coal demand as a result of higher natural gas prices and reduced utility stockpiles, partially offset by severe weather issues impacting service levels. Agricultural products revenues of $3.6 billion declined 4% versus 2012 due to volume declines, which were mainly attributable to lower grain exports as a result of the drought conditions in the U.S. in 2012 and strong global competition. Operating expenses in 2013 were approximately $15.4 billion, an increase of $522 million (3.5%) compared to 2012. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $146 million (3.2%) as compared to 2012, reflecting volume-related cost increases and wage inflation. Fuel expenses increased $44 million (1%) versus 2012, as the impact of higher volume was partially offset by lower average fuel prices. Purchased services expenses increased 2% versus 2012, due primarily to volume-related costs, including purchased transportation for BNSF Logistics LLC, a wholly-owned, third-party logistics business. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $204 million (13%) over 2012. The increase was primarily due to higher property taxes, crew travel costs, derailment-related costs and locomotive material expenses. Interest expense in 2014 was $833 million, an increase of $104 million (14%) compared to 2013. Interest expense in 2013 increased $106 million (17%) versus 2012. BNSF funds its capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and new debt issuances. In each period, the increased interest expense resulted from higher average outstanding debt. Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) We hold an 89.9% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates an international energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are currently comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”), and NV Energy, which was acquired in December 2013. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. BHE acquired AltaLink, L.P. (“AltaLink”) on December 1, 2014. AltaLink operates a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada. AltaLink’s revenues and earnings for the month of December 2014 are included in other energy businesses. In addition, BHE also operates a diversified portfolio of independent power projects and the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm and franchise network in the United States. The rates that our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent these operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. Revenues and earnings of BHE are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.

Revenues in 2014 were $5.3 billion, an increase of $100 million (2%) compared to revenues in 2013. In 2014, revenues increased primarily due to higher rates, partially offset by lower retail customer load. PacifiCorp’s EBIT were $1.0 billion, an increase of $28 million (3%) over 2013. The increase in EBIT reflected the impact of the increase in operating revenues and the recognition of estimated insurance recoveries from a fire loss as compared to a reduction in 2013 EBIT from charges related to the fire, partially offset by increased energy costs and higher depreciation expense. The increase in depreciation expense reflected the impact of changes in depreciation rates and higher plant in service, including a new generation facility. Revenues in 2013 were $5.2 billion, an increase of $265 million (5%) compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to higher retail revenues of $337 million, partially offset by lower renewable energy credits of $74 million. The increase in retail revenues reflected higher prices approved by regulators and higher retail customer loads. EBIT in 2013 were $982 million, an increase of $245 million (33%) compared to 2012. The comparative increase in EBIT was primarily due to charges of $165 million in 2012 related to litigation, fire and other damage claims, and, to a lesser extent, the increase in revenues. Before the impact of the aforementioned claims, EBIT in 2013 as a percentage of revenues were relatively unchanged from 2012. MEC MEC operates a regulated utility business primarily in Iowa and Illinois. Revenues in 2014 increased $365 million (11%) to $3.8 billion. In 2014, revenues from regulated natural gas increased $172 million compared to 2013. The increase in regulated natural gas revenues was driven by higher per-unit natural gas costs, which are recovered from customers via adjustment clauses, and higher volumes attributable to colder weather in the first quarter of 2014. Regulated electric revenues increased $55 million compared to 2013 and was primarily due to increased retail rates. Nonregulated revenues increased $122 million compared to 2013 due to higher natural gas and electricity prices and higher electricity volumes, partly offset by lower natural gas volumes. EBIT were $298 million in 2014, an increase of $68 million (30%) compared to 2013. The comparative increase in EBIT was primarily due to increased earnings from the regulated electric business, reflecting the impact of higher revenues and lower depreciation and amortization expense due to the impact of depreciation rate changes, partially offset by increased energy and operating costs. Revenues in 2013 increased $178 million (5%) over 2012. The increase in revenues reflected higher regulated electric and natural gas revenues and lower nonregulated and other revenues. Regulated retail electric revenues increased $82 million, while regulated natural gas revenues increased $165 million compared to 2012. The increase in regulated electric revenues was primarily due to higher regulatory rates in Iowa and Illinois and increases in retail customer load. The increase in regulated natural gas revenues was primarily due to higher retail volumes and increases in recoveries through adjustment clauses as a result of a higher average per-unit cost of gas sold. Nonregulated and other operating revenues declined $67 million compared to 2012 primarily due to lower electricity volumes and prices. EBIT declined $6 million in 2013 compared to 2012, reflecting lower regulated and nonregulated electric operating earnings, partially offset by higher natural gas earnings. NV Energy BHE acquired NV Energy on December 19, 2013, and its results are included in our consolidated results beginning as of that date. In 2014, revenues and EBIT were $3.3 billion and $549 million, respectively. In 2013, NV Energy’s results for the December 19 through 31, 2013 period were included in other energy businesses and reflected one-time customer refunds, acquisition costs and other charges arising from the acquisition. NV Energy’s revenues and EBIT are normally higher in the second and third quarters due to higher electricity consumption in its service territories. Northern Powergrid Northern Powergrid’s revenues of $1.3 billion in 2014 increased $258 million (25%) as compared to 2013. EBIT were $527 million in 2014, an increase of $165 million (46%) compared to 2013. The increases in revenues and EBIT were due mainly to increased distribution revenues from increased rates and favorable regulatory provisions and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation. In 2013, revenues declined $10 million (1%) compared to 2012. EBIT in 2013 was $362 million, a decline of $67 million versus 2012. EBIT were negatively impacted by fourth quarter rebates to customers and higher regulatory rate provisions, which reduced revenues, and from higher distribution operating expenses and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation in 2013. Operating expenses in 2013 included comparatively higher pension costs and higher depreciation expenses. EBIT in 2013 also included a $9 million loss from the write-off of hydrocarbon well exploration costs. 42 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) Natural Gas Pipelines Natural gas pipeline revenues increased $122 million (13%) in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase reflected comparatively higher revenues from increased natural gas rates and volumes as a result of significantly colder weather conditions in the first quarter of 2014 in Northern Natural Gas Company’s service territory and system rebalancing activities over the first half of 2014. EBIT in 2014 of $379 million were relatively unchanged from 2013. Revenues and EBIT in 2013 were $971 million and $385 million, respectively, and were relatively unchanged from 2012. Other energy businesses Revenues and EBIT in 2014 from other energy businesses increased $408 million and $232 million, respectively, over revenues and EBIT in 2013. The increases were primarily attributable to increased revenues from new solar facilities as additional assets were placed in service and from the inclusion of revenues and EBIT of AltaLink for the month of December. The increase in revenues from other activities in 2013 was $81 million, which was primarily attributable to revenues from the new solar and wind-powered facilities, partially offset by the impact of one-time customer refunds issued by NV Energy and impairment losses associated with BHE’s interests in certain geothermal electricity generation projects. EBIT from other activities declined $87 million in 2013 compared to 2012, as the impacts of the aforementioned losses associated with geothermal projects and NV Energy acquisition costs and customer refunds, more than offset the increase in earnings from the new solar and wind-powered electricity generation projects. Real estate brokerage Revenues of the real estate brokerage businesses increased $339 million (19%) in 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase reflected the impact of revenues from acquired businesses, partially offset by lower revenues from existing operations, due to a 6% decline in closed units and lower franchise revenues. EBIT of $139 million in 2014 were unchanged from 2013 as the increases in EBIT from acquired businesses were offset by lower EBIT from existing businesses and higher operating expenses related to “Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices” rebranding activities. Real estate brokerage revenues in 2013 increased $489 million (37%) over 2012, while EBIT increased $57 million (70%) versus 2012. The increases in revenues and EBIT were attributable to increases in closed brokerage transactions and higher average home sales prices from existing business and the impact of businesses acquired during the previous two years. Corporate interest and income taxes Corporate interest includes interest on unsecured debt issued by BHE and borrowings from certain Berkshire insurance subsidiaries. In 2014, corporate interest expense increased due to new borrowings in connection with the NV Energy and AltaLink acquisitions. BHE’s consolidated effective income tax rates were 23% in 2014, 7% in 2013 and 9% in 2012. In each year, BHE’s income tax rates reflect significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation in the United States. In addition, pre-tax earnings of Northern Powergrid are taxed at a lower statutory tax rate in the United Kingdom compared to the statutory tax rate in the United States. BHE’s effective rate was reduced in 2013 due to a reduction of deferred income tax liabilities as a result of enacted statutory income tax rate decreases in the United Kingdom. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 McLane Company $ 46,640 $ 45,930 $ 37,437 $ 435 $ 486 $ 403 Manufacturing 36,773 34,258 32,105 4,811 4,205 3,911 Service 9,854 8,996 8,175 1,202 1,093 966 Retailing 4,422 4,288 3,715 344 376 306 $ 97,689 $ 93,472 $ 81,432 Pre-tax earnings 6,792 6,160 5,586 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 2,324 2,283 2,229 $ 4,468 $ 3,877 $ 3,357 43 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. In 2012, McLane acquired Meadowbrook Meat Company, Inc. (“MBM”), a large foodservice distributor for national restaurant chains. Through its subsidiaries, McLane also operates as a wholesale distributor of distilled spirits, wine and beer. McLane’s grocery and foodservice businesses are marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins and have several significant customers, including Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven and Yum! Brands. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have a significant adverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues in 2014 of $46.6 billion increased $710 million (1.5%) compared to 2013. The overall revenue increase reflected increased foodservice and beverage revenues, while grocery revenues were relatively flat. Pre-tax earnings in 2014 declined $51 million (10.5%) from 2013. Earnings in 2013 included a pre-tax gain of $24 million from the sale of a logistics business. Before the impact of this gain, McLane’s earnings in 2014 decreased 6% compared to 2013. The decline reflected higher earnings from the grocery and beverage businesses which was more than offset by lower earnings from the foodservice business. In 2014, our foodservice operations experienced higher per unit processing costs and higher other operating costs which more than offset the increase in revenues. McLane’s revenues in 2013 were approximately $45.9 billion, representing an increase of approximately $8.5 billion (23%) over revenues in 2012. The increase in revenues reflected the impact of the MBM acquisition, as well as year-to-date revenue increases ranging from 10% to 15% in the grocery, other foodservice and beverage businesses. Revenues of each of these businesses in 2013 included the impact of new customers added in 2012 and 2013. McLane’s pre-tax earnings in 2013 increased $83 million (21%) over earnings in 2012. The increase in 2013 pre-tax earnings reflected the increases in revenues, including the impact of the MBM acquisition, and a gain from the sale of a logistics business, partially offset by slightly lower operating margins. Manufacturing This group includes a variety of businesses that manufacture industrial and end-user products and include: The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”), a specialty chemical manufacturer; IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide; Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehicles; and CTB, a manufacturer of equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries. Also included are the diversified manufacturing operations of Marmon, which in prior years were presented separately with its transportation equipment manufacturing and leasing operations. In this report, Marmon’s transportation equipment manufacturing and leasing businesses are included in our finance and financial products group. Our manufacturing businesses also include several building products businesses (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville, Shaw and MiTek) and six apparel businesses (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes Russell athletic apparel and Vanity Fair Brands women’s intimate apparel). Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 Industrial and end-user products $ 22,314 $ 20,325 $ 19,003 $ 3,460 $ 3,044 $ 2,912 Building products 10,124 9,640 8,953 896 846 748 Apparel 4,335 4,293 4,149 455 315 251 $36,773 $ 34,258 $ 32,105 $ 4,811 $ 4,205 $ 3,911 Aggregate revenues of our manufacturers in 2014 increased $2.5 billion (7%) to $36.8 billion. Pre-tax earnings of this group of businesses were $4.8 billion in 2014, an increase of $606 million (14%) versus 2013. Revenues in 2014 from our industrial and end-user products manufacturers increased $2.0 billion (10%) to $22.3 billion. Pre-tax earnings from these businesses in 2014 increased $416 million (14%) to $3.5 billion. Lubrizol’s revenues in 2014 increased $546 million (9%) to $6.9 billion, while pre-tax earnings increased 10% compared to 2013. The increases were primarily due to the impact of bolt-on acquisitions. Forest River’s revenues in 2014 increased 14% to $3.8 billion due to increased unit sales. Forest River’s pre-tax earnings in 2014 increased 21% over 2013 due primarily to the aforementioned increase in unit sales and relatively lower manufacturing costs. In 2014, IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 18% over 2013 which reflected the impact of a 6% year-to-date increase in sales, as well as increased gross margin rates and lower operating expense rates. 44 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Manufacturing (Continued) Marmon’s manufacturing revenues were $5.95 billion in 2014, an increase of $791 million (15%) compared to 2013. The revenue increase in 2014 was primarily attributable to the beverage dispensing and merchandising businesses acquired at the beginning of 2014. Excluding this acquisition’s impact, revenues were relatively unchanged from 2013. In 2014, Marmon experienced volume-driven revenue growth in several business markets, including: commercial trailer and aftermarket brake drums; residential water treatment systems in China and the United States; specialty metal pipe, tubing and steel beam; specialty and utility cable products; and automotive, safety and construction fastener markets. These increases were substantially offset by revenue declines from lower copper prices and lower volumes in the electrical and plumbing products businesses and the strategic decision to exit the low margin building wire and copper tubing businesses. Marmon’s manufacturing pre-tax earnings were $708 million in 2014, an increase of $111 million (19%) over earnings in 2013. The earnings increase primarily reflected the favorable impact of the acquisition of IMI plc beverage dispensing and merchandising businesses, the impact of the revenue growth discussed previously and cost savings associated with restructuring actions taken in the retail store equipment and electrical and plumbing products businesses. Revenues in 2014 from our building products businesses were approximately $10.1 billion, an increase of 5% over 2013. In 2014, Johns Manville, Acme and MiTek produced revenue increases, which were primarily due to higher sales volume, as well as from the impact of recent MiTek bolt-on acquisitions. Revenues in 2014 from Shaw were relatively unchanged from 2013, reflecting the impact of the closure of its rugs division in early 2014 and lower carpet sales, offset by higher sales of hard flooring products. Pre-tax earnings in 2014 of the building products businesses increased 6% compared to 2013. Each of our building products businesses generated increased earnings in 2014 over 2013, with the exception of Shaw, whose earnings declined due to comparatively higher raw material costs. Apparel revenues in 2014 were $4.3 billion, a slight increase (1%) compared to 2013. Pre-tax earnings increased $140 million (44%) over 2013. In 2014, our apparel businesses benefitted from restructuring initiatives undertaken in 2013 and 2014, which included discontinuing unprofitable business, as well as from comparatively lower manufacturing and pension costs. Aggregate revenues of our manufacturers in 2013 were $34.3 billion, an increase of $2.15 billion (7%) versus 2012. Pre-tax earnings of this group of businesses were $4.2 billion in 2013, an increase of $294 million (8%) versus 2012. Revenues in 2013 from our industrial and end-user products manufacturers increased $1.3 billion (7%) to $20.3 billion, while pre-tax earnings increased $132 million (5%) to $3.0 billion. The increases in revenues and pre-tax earnings were primarily attributable to bolt-on acquisitions and increased revenues and earnings of Forest River. Lubrizol’s revenues in 2013 increased $267 million over 2012 to $6.4 billion, while revenues of IMC increased 10%. However, Lubrizol’s and IMC’s pre-tax earnings in 2013 were relatively unchanged from 2012. Forest River revenues in 2013 were $3.3 billion, an increase of 24% over 2012, which was due to a 17% increase in volume and higher average sales prices, attributable to price and product mix changes. The increase in revenues drove Forest River’s 32% increase in pre-tax earnings in 2013. Marmon’s manufacturing revenues in 2013 were $5.2 billion, a decrease of 3.5% compared to 2012. The revenue decline in 2013 was primarily due to the impact of lower steel and copper costs in the electrical and plumbing products businesses, volume reductions in the specialty metal pipe, tubing and steel beam businesses, several non-recurring large prior year projects in the specialty wire and cable business, and revenue reductions from exiting low margin building wire and copper tubing businesses. These reductions more than offset the revenue gains contributed by the automotive clutch and heavy duty truck axle, store fixture display products and the residential water treatment businesses. Marmon’s manufacturing pre-tax earnings in 2013 were $597 million, and were relatively unchanged from 2012. Pre-tax earnings benefitted from cost savings associated with restructuring actions taken in both the retail store equipment and electrical and plumbing products businesses. Revenues in 2013 from our building products businesses increased 8% to about $9.6 billion. Pre-tax earnings of these businesses were $846 million, an increase of $98 million (13%) over 2012. These businesses benefitted from the generally improved residential and commercial construction markets. Apparel revenues in 2013 increased 3.5% to about $4.3 billion and pre-tax earnings increased $64 million (25%) to $315 million. Each of our apparel operations contributed to the higher earnings in 2013. 45 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service Our service businesses include NetJets, the world’s leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft. Among the other businesses included in this group are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor; Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings; Dairy Queen, which licenses and services a system of over 6,500 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; Buffalo News and the BH Media Group (“BH Media”), which includes the Omaha World-Herald, as well as 28 other daily newspapers and numerous other publications; and WPLG (acquired June 30, 2014), which operates a television station in Miami, Florida. Revenues of our service businesses in 2014 were approximately $9.85 billion, representing an increase of $858 million (9.5%) over 2013. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to comparative increases generated by NetJets, TTI, and FlightSafety. The revenue increase at NetJets reflected increased flight services revenues, which was attributable to increased flight hours as well as increased fractional aircraft sales. TTI’s revenue increase was driven by higher unit volume and, to a lesser extent, by bolt-on acquisitions. FlightSafety’s revenue increase was primarily due to increased simulator training hours. Pre-tax earnings of our service businesses in 2014 aggregated $1.2 billion, an increase of $109 million (10%) versus 2013. The increase in year-to-date earnings was primarily attributable to NetJets and TTI and was primarily due to the aforementioned increases in revenues. In addition, NetJets’ earnings increase was also due to comparatively lower aircraft impairment and restructuring charges and financing expenses, which were partially offset by higher depreciation expense, maintenance costs and subcontracted flight expenses. Revenues of our service businesses in 2013 were $9.0 billion, an increase of $821 million (10%) over revenues in 2012. In 2013, revenues of NetJets increased $288 million (7.5%), driven by higher sales of fractional aircraft shares, while TTI’s revenues increased $255 million (11%) over 2012. Revenues of BH Media increased $207 million (66%), attributable to the impact of business acquisitions. Pre-tax earnings of $1.1 billion in 2013 increased $127 million (13%) compared to 2012. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to BH Media, FlightSafety, TTI and NetJets. The earnings increase of BH Media was due to bolt-on acquisitions. TTI’s earnings increased 10% due to higher sales and changes in product mix. FlightSafety’s earnings increased 11%, reflecting increased training revenues and relatively unchanged operating expenses. NetJets’ earnings increased 7% as improved flight operations margins, fractional sales margins and reduced net financing costs more than offset an increase in aircraft impairment charges. Retailing Our retailing operations consist of four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies, Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools and Oriental Trading Company (“OTC”), a direct retailer of party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties. Revenues in 2014 increased $134 million (3%), while pre-tax earnings declined $32 million (8.5%) compared to 2013. The earnings declines in 2014 were primarily attributable to lower earnings from Nebraska Furniture Mart and Pampered Chef. The earnings decline at Nebraska Furniture Mart was driven by costs incurred related to the build-out of a new store and warehouse facility (approximately 1.8 million square feet) in The Colony, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. The new store will open in 2015 and we anticipate it will generate meaningful revenues and earnings in the future. The decline in earnings of Pampered Chef resulted from lower sales. Revenues of our retailing businesses in 2013 were $4.3 billion, an increase of $573 million (15%) over 2012. Pre-tax earnings of these businesses increased $70 million (23%) as compared to earnings in 2012. The comparative increases in revenues and earnings were primarily attributable to the inclusion of OTC for the full year in 2013. Otherwise, earnings of the home furnishings and jewelry retail groups increased while earnings of Pampered Chef and See’s Candies declined. 46 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Finance and Financial Products Our finance and financial products businesses include manufactured housing and finance (Clayton Homes), transportation equipment manufacturing and leasing businesses (UTLX and XTRA, and together, “transportation equipment leasing”), as well as other leasing and financing activities. UTLX manufactures, owns and leases railcars and intermodal tank cars, and also owns and leases cranes, while XTRA owns and leases over-the-road trailers. A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 Manufactured housing and finance $ 3,310 $ 3,199 $ 3,014 $ 558 $ 416 $ 255 Transportation equipment leasing 2,427 2,180 2,168 827 704 651 Other 789 731 751 454 444 487 $ 6,526 $ 6,110 $ 5,933 Pre-tax earnings 1,839 1,564 1,393 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 596 556 494 $ 1,243 $ 1,008 $ 899 Clayton Homes’ revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2014 increased $111 million (3%) and $142 million (34%), respectively, compared to revenues and earnings in 2013. The increase in revenues was principally due to a 7% increase in homes sold, as interest and financial services revenues were relatively unchanged from 2013. Earnings continued to benefit from lower loan loss provisions on installment loan portfolios, lower interest expense on borrowings and improved manufacturing results. The declines in loan loss provisions reflected fewer delinquencies and foreclosures, while the declines in interest expense were primarily due to lower rates. Traditional single family housing markets receive significant interest rate subsidies from the U.S. government through government agency insured mortgages. For the most part, these subsidies are not available to factory built homes. Despite this competitive disadvantage, Clayton Homes remains the largest manufactured housing business in the United States and we believe that it will continue to operate profitably, even under the prevailing conditions. Clayton Homes’ revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2013 increased $185 million (6%) and $161 million (63%), respectively, compared to 2012. Pre-tax earnings benefitted from increased home sales, lower loan loss provisions and an increase in net interest income, as lower interest expense more than offset reductions in interest income on loan portfolios. Home unit sales increased 9%. Loan loss provisions declined, reflecting comparatively lower foreclosures volume and loss rates. Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2014 from our transportation equipment leasing businesses were $2.4 billion, and $827 million, respectively, which exceeded revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2013 by 11% and 17%, respectively. The earnings increase reflected a 9% increase in aggregate lease revenues, primarily due to increased units on lease and higher lease rates for railcars. A significant portion of the costs of these businesses, such as depreciation, will not vary proportionately to revenue changes and therefore changes in revenues can disproportionately impact earnings. Pre-tax earnings in 2013 from transportation equipment leasing increased $53 million (8%) to $704 million. The increase in earnings reflected increased lease revenues and earnings of both UTLX and XTRA, which benefitted from increases in working units and average rental rates and relatively stable operating expenses. Earnings from our other finance activities include CORT’s furniture leasing business, interest and dividends from a portfolio of investments and our share of the earnings of a commercial mortgage servicing business in which we own a 50% joint venture interest. In addition, other earnings include income from interest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes on borrowings by a Berkshire financing subsidiary that are used to fund installment loans of Clayton Homes and guarantee fees charged to NetJets. Corresponding expenses are included in Clayton Homes’ and NetJets’ results. Interest spreads and guarantee fees charged to Clayton and NetJets were $70 million in 2014, $89 million in 2013 and $120 million in 2012. 47 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows. Amounts are in millions. 2014 2013 2012 Investment gains/losses $ 4,272 $ 4,293 $ 1,799 Other-than-temporary impairments (697 ) (228 ) (337 ) Derivative gains/losses 506 2,608 1,963 Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 4,081 6,673 3,425 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 760 2,336 1,198 Net gains/losses $ 3,321 $ 4,337 $ 2,227 Investment gains/losses arise primarily from the sale or redemption of investments or when investments are carried at fair value with the periodic changes in fair values recorded in earnings. The timing of gains or losses from sales or redemptions can have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses included in earnings usually have minimal impact on the periodic changes in our consolidated shareholders’ equity since most of our investments are recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical or predictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will have on our reported earnings. Although our management does not consider investment gains and losses in a given period as necessarily meaningful or useful in evaluating periodic earnings, we are providing information to explain the nature of such gains and losses when reflected in earnings. Pre-tax investment gains in 2014 were $4.3 billion, which included gains of approximately $2.1 billion realized in connection with the exchanges of common stock of Phillips 66 and Graham Holdings Company for 100% of the common stock of a specified subsidiary of each of those companies. Each exchange transaction was structured as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, no income taxes are payable on the excess of the fair value of the businesses received over the tax-basis cost of the common stock of Phillips 66 and Graham Holdings Company exchanged. Pre-tax investment gains/losses in 2013 were $4.3 billion and included approximately $2.1 billion related to our investments in General Electric and Goldman Sachs common stock warrants and Wrigley subordinated notes. Beginning in 2013, the unrealized gains or losses associated with the warrants were included in earnings. These warrants were exercised in October 2013 on a cashless basis in exchange for shares of General Electric and Goldman Sachs common stock with an aggregate value of approximately $2.4 billion. The Wrigley subordinated notes were repurchased for cash of $5.08 billion, resulting in a pre-tax investment gain of $680 million. Pre-tax investment gains were approximately $1.5 billion in 2012 and were primarily attributable to sales of equity securities. Other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) charges in 2014 were $697 million and predominantly related to our investments in equity securities of Tesco PLC. OTTI charges in 2013 and 2012 predominantly related to our investments in Texas Competitive Electric Holdings bonds. Although we have periodically recorded OTTI charges in earnings in past years, we continue to hold some of those securities. If the market values of those investments increase following the date OTTI charges are recorded in earnings, the increases are not reflected in earnings but are instead included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. When recorded, OTTI charges have no impact whatsoever on the asset values otherwise recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets or on our consolidated shareholders’ equity. In addition, the recognition of such losses in earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income does not necessarily indicate that sales are planned and sales ultimately may not occur for a number of years. Furthermore, the recognition of OTTI charges does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is permanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, consolidated gross unrealized losses on our investments in equity and fixed maturity securities determined on an individual purchase lot basis were approximately $1.2 billion and $289 million, respectively. We have concluded that as of December 31, 2014, these unrealized losses were not other than temporary. We consider several factors in determining whether or not impairments are deemed to be other than temporary, including the current and expected long-term business prospects and if applicable, the creditworthiness of the issuer, our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers and the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline. 48 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) Derivative gains/losses primarily represent the changes in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contracts. Periodic changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying credit and equity markets. In 2014, derivative contracts produced pre-tax gains of $506 million. The change in the fair value of our credit default contract during 2014 produced a pre-tax gain of $397 million, and was attributable to lower credit spreads. There were no credit loss payments in 2014. Equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax gains of $108 million in 2014. Such gains reflected the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and generally higher index values, partially offset by the negative impact of lower interest rate assumptions. As of December 31, 2014, the intrinsic value of these contracts was approximately $1.4 billion and our recorded liability at fair value was approximately $4.6 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our remaining equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates, which begin in 2018, and will be based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts as of those dates. In 2013, derivative contracts generated a pre-tax gain of $2.6 billion, including $2.8 billion gain from equity index put option contracts and pre-tax losses of $213 million from credit default contracts. The gain from equity index put option contracts was due to changes in fair values of the contracts as a result of overall higher equity index values, favorable currency movements and modestly higher interest rate assumptions. The credit default contract loss was primarily attributable to an increase in estimated liabilities of our remaining municipality issuer contract, reflecting wider credit spreads. There were no credit loss payments in 2013. In 2012, our derivative contracts produced pre-tax gains of approximately $2.0 billion, and included pre-tax gains from equity index put option contracts of approximately $1.0 billion and gains from credit default contracts of approximately $900 million. The gains related to equity index put option contracts were due to increased index values, foreign currency exchange rate changes and valuation adjustments on a small number of contracts where contractual settlements will be determined differently than the standard determination of intrinsic value, partially offset by lower interest rate assumptions. The gains on credit default contracts were attributable to narrower spreads and reduced time exposure, as well as from settlements related to the termination of certain contracts. In 2012, credit loss payments were $68 million. Other Corporate income and expenses not allocated to operating businesses produced after-tax losses of $145 million in 2014, $712 million in 2013 and $797 million in 2012. Our investments in Heinz generated after-tax earnings of $652 million in 2014 and $95 million in 2013. Also included in other earnings are amortization of fair value adjustments made in connection with several prior business acquisitions (primarily related to the amortization of identifiable intangible assets) and corporate interest expense. These two charges (after-tax) aggregated $682 million in 2014, $514 million in 2013 and $630 million in 2012. Financial Condition Our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2014 was $240.2 billion, an increase of $18.3 billion since December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2014, cash and investments of our insurance and other businesses approximated $217.2 billion (excludes our investments in H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation). In December 2014, an insurance subsidiary acquired common and preferred stock of Restaurant Brands International, Inc. for $3.0 billion in the aggregate. At December 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents of insurance and other businesses were $58.0 billion, an increase of $15.5 billion since December 31, 2013. Berkshire Hathaway parent company borrowings include $8.0 billion of senior unsecured notes, of which $1.7 billion matured in February 2015. We currently expect to issue new senior notes in 2015 to replace some or all of this maturity. In 2014, Berkshire issued $750 million of parent company senior notes maturing in 2019 and repaid $750 million of notes in August. During the first quarter of 2014, Berkshire paid approximately $1.2 billion as final payment in connection with our acquisition of substantially all outstanding shares held by Marmon non-controlling shareholders at December 31, 2013. Berkshire’s Board of Directors has authorized Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B common shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares at management’s discretion. The repurchase program is expected to continue indefinitely, but does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B common shares. Repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash and cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. There were no share repurchases under the program during 2014. 49 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) On December 1, 2014, BHE completed its acquisition of AltaLink, a regulated electric transmission-only company serving customers in Alberta, Canada. BHE purchased AltaLink for cash of approximately C$3.1 (approximately $2.7 billion). The acquisition was funded through loans from Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries and the issuance of $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes due in 2020, 2025 and 2045. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. In 2014, aggregate capital expenditures of these businesses were approximately $11.8 billion, including $6.6 billion by BHE and $5.2 billion by BNSF. BNSF and BHE forecast aggregate capital expenditures of approximately $12.3 billion in 2015. Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded from cash flows from operations and debt issuances. In 2014, BNSF issued $3.0 billion of senior unsecured debentures with maturities in 2024 and 2044. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $19.3 billion as of December 31, 2014. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were approximately $36.3 billion as of December 31, 2014, which excludes borrowings from Berkshire insurance subsidiaries. BNSF and BHE have aggregate debt and capital lease maturities in 2015 of about $3 billion. Berkshire’s commitment to provide additional capital to BHE to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund its regulated utility subsidiaries expired in 2014. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BHE or BNSF or any of their subsidiaries. Finance and financial products assets were approximately $33.5 billion as of December 31, 2014 and $33.2 billion as of December 31, 2013. Assets of these businesses consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, cash and cash equivalents, a portfolio of fixed maturity and equity investments, as well as a sizable portfolio of various types of equipment and furniture held for lease. The carrying values of assets held for lease were approximately $7.3 billion at December 31, 2014 and $7.0 billion at December 31, 2013. Finance and financial products liabilities were $18.9 billion as of December 31, 2014 and $19.8 billion as of December 31, 2013, which included notes payable and other borrowings of $12.7 billion and $13.1 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, notes payable included $11.2 billion of notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). In 2014, BHFC issued $1.15 billion of senior unsecured notes to replace maturing notes. The new senior notes mature in 2017 and 2018. An additional $1.0 billion of BHFC debt matured in January 2015 and at that time BHFC issued $1.0 billion of new senior notes that mature in 2017 and 2018. The proceeds from the BHFC notes are used to fund originated loans and acquired loans of Clayton Homes. As described in Note 12 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, our finance and financial products businesses are party to equity index put option and credit default contracts. With limited exception, these contracts contain no collateral posting requirements under any circumstances, including changes in either the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts or a downgrade in Berkshire’s credit ratings. At December 31, 2014, the liabilities recorded for such contracts were approximately $4.8 billion and we had no collateral posting requirements. The full and timely payment of principal and interest on the BHFC notes and payment of amounts due at the expiration of the equity index put option and credit default contracts is guaranteed by Berkshire. We regularly access the credit markets, particularly through our railroad, utilities and energy and finance and financial products businesses. Restricted access to credit markets at affordable rates in the future could have a significant negative impact on our operations. In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Reform Act”) was signed into law. The Reform Act reshapes financial regulations in the United States by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and market participants and providing new enforcement powers to regulators. Virtually all major areas of the Reform Act have been subject to extensive rulemaking proceedings being conducted both jointly and independently by multiple regulatory agencies, some of which have been completed and others that are expected to be finalized during the next several months. Although the Reform Act may adversely affect some of our business activities, it is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition. 50 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as minimum rentals under operating leases and certain purchase obligations, and are not currently reflected in the financial statements. Such obligations will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included in the following table to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date. The timing and/or amount of the payments under certain contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table that follows. Most significantly, the timing and amount of payments arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future claim settlement activities or events. In addition, obligations arising under life, annuity and health insurance benefits are contingent on future premiums, allowances, mortality, morbidity, expenses and policy lapse rates, as applicable. These amounts are based on the liability estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014. Although certain insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and life, annuity and health benefits are ceded under reinsurance contracts, receivables recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are not reflected in the table. A summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 follows. Amounts are in millions. Estimated payments due by period Total 2015 2016-2017 2018-2019 After 2019 Notes payable and other borrowings (1) $ 128,267 $ 10,775 $ 16,157 $ 16,772 $ 84,563 Operating leases 8,642 1,279 2,160 1,598 3,605 Purchase obligations 43,985 14,592 9,091 6,635 13,667 Losses and loss adjustment expenses (2) 73,222 14,883 15,942 9,282 33,115 Life, annuity and health insurance benefits (3) 25,336 1,443 235 325 23,333 Other 20,635 5,107 1,280 2,158 12,090 Total $ 300,087 $ 48,079 $ 44,865 $ 36,770 $ 170,373 (1) Includes interest. (2) Before reserve discounts of $1,745 million. (3) Amounts represent estimated undiscounted benefits, net of estimated future premiums, as applicable. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Property and casualty losses A summary of our consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Amounts are in millions. Gross unpaid losses Net unpaid losses * Dec. 31, 2014 Dec. 31, 2013 Dec. 31, 2014 Dec. 31, 2013 GEICO $ 12,207 $ 11,342 $ 11,402 $ 10,644 General Re 14,790 15,668 14,006 14,757 BHRG 35,916 30,446 27,420 25,314 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 8,564 7,410 7,761 6,737 Total $ 71,477 $ 64,866 $ 60,589 $ 57,452 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges on reinsurance assumed. 51 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts with respect to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. Except for certain workers’ compensation liabilities, all liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as “gross unpaid losses”) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value. The timing and amount of loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the final determination of the ultimate loss amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used in establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses. Regardless of the techniques used, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate liabilities payable in the future. In establishing liability estimates at our various insurance operations, we utilize processes and techniques that are believed to best suit the underlying claims and available data. As of any balance sheet date, not all claims that have occurred have been reported and not all reported claims have been settled. Loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities include provisions for reported claims (referred to as “case reserves”) and for claims that have not been reported (referred to as incurred but not yet reported (“IBNR”) reserves). The time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement or payment date is referred to as the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within a few years of occurrence. Casualty losses usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contributes to extending claim-tails. Receivables are recorded with respect to losses ceded to other reinsurers and are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses. In addition, reinsurance receivables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders. Additional information regarding those processes and techniques of our significant insurance businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows. GEICO GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. GEICO’s gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities as of December 31, 2014 were $12.2 billion compared to $11.3 billion as of December 31, 2013. Liabilities at December 31, 2014 included $8.6 billion of reported average, case and case development reserves and $3.6 billion of IBNR reserves. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims (or a “ground-up” approach), which yield an aggregate estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. The key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). Our actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The significant liability components (and percentage of GEICO’s gross liabilities as of December 31, 2014) are: (1) average reserves (15%), (2) case and case development reserves (55%) and (3) IBNR reserves (30%). Each of these liability components is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. Liabilities are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, rated state, reporting date and occurrence date, among other ways. A brief discussion of each liability component follows. We establish average reserves for reported auto damage claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. The average reserves are intended to represent a reasonable estimate for incurred claims for claims when adjusters have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that are paid within a relatively short time after being reported. Aggregate average reserves are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened. Claims adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss reserve estimates once the facts and merits of each claim are evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised over time as more information becomes available. 52 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Within the automobile line of business, reserves for liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of protracted litigation, and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is first established. As a result case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of ultimate cost, so we establish additional case development reserve estimates, which are usually percentages of the case reserve. As of December 31, 2014, case development reserves averaged approximately 25% of the established case reserves. In general, case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves and are reviewed and revised periodically. Approximately 92% of GEICO’s reserves as of December 31, 2014 were for automobile liability coverages, of which BI coverage accounted for approximately 55%. For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are deducted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established through the collaborative effort of actuarial, claims and other management personnel. For each significant coverage, we test the adequacy of the aggregate liabilities for unpaid losses using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability estimates recorded at the end of 2013 developed downward by $386 million when reevaluated through December 31, 2014, producing a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2014. These reserve developments represented approximately 1.9% of earned premiums in 2014 and approximately 3.6% of prior year-end recorded net liabilities. During 2013, estimated liabilities for pre-2013 occurrences developed downward $238 million or 2.4% of net liabilities as of the end of 2012. In both years, the downward development reflected overall lower than expected frequencies and severities. Reserving assumptions at December 31, 2014 were modified as appropriate to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future reserve development will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated. We believe it is reasonably possible that the average BI severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used. If actual BI severity changes one percentage point from what was used in establishing the reserves, our reserves would develop up or down by approximately $185 million resulting in a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to be different from expected would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. GEICO’s exposure to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining liabilities associated with such exposure are currently an immaterial component of GEICO’s total reserves (approximately 1.2%) and there is minimal apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure. General Re and BHRG Liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses of General Re and BHRG derive primarily from reinsurance contracts. Additional uncertainties are unique to the processes used in estimating reinsurance liabilities. The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than under primary insurance policies. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk), per occurrence excess or retroactive reinsurance contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract, if reinsurer personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. However, loss information related to aggregate excess-of-loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Loss information may be reported in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is usually provided through periodic reports, which may include currently recoverable losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers. 53 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re and BHRG (Continued) Each of our reinsurance businesses has established practices to identify and gather needed information from clients in order to establish adequate liability estimates. These practices include, for example, comparison of expected premiums to reported premiums to help identify delinquent client reports and claim reviews to facilitate loss reporting and identify inaccurate or incomplete claim reporting. The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is typically delayed in comparison with claim reporting to primary insurers. In some instances, multiple reinsurers assume and cede parts of an underlying risk thereby causing multiple contractual intermediaries between General Re or BHRG and the primary insured. In these instances, the claim reporting delays are compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, and the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance contract and for other reasons. Periodic premium and claims reports are often required from ceding companies. In the U.S., such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. Outside the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices vary. In certain countries, clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. Premium and loss data is provided through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data provided is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Generally, BHRG and General Re are permitted under the contracts to access the cedant’s books and records with respect to the subject business, thus providing us the ability to conduct audits to determine the accuracy and completeness of information. Audits are conducted as we deem appropriate. In the normal course of business, disputes with clients occasionally arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through the involvement of our claims department personnel and the appropriate client personnel or through independent outside counsel. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or an alternative dispute resolution process will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. General Re General Re’s gross and net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and gross reserves by major line of business as of December 31, 2014 are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Type Line of business Reported case reserves $ 7,369 Workers’ compensation (1) $ 2,720 IBNR reserves 7,421 Mass tort-asbestos/environmental 1,522 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 14,790 Auto liability 3,795 Ceded reinsurance receivables and deferred charges (784 ) Other casualty (2) 2,162 Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 14,006 Other general liability 2,231 Property 2,360 Total $ 14,790 (1) Net of discounts of $1,745 million. (2) Includes directors and officers, errors and omissions, medical malpractice and umbrella coverage. General Re’s loss reserve estimation process is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case loss estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (“ACRs”) and IBNR reserves. The critical processes in establishing loss reserves involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the determination of expected ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and the comparison of case reserve reporting trends to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded liabilities are subject to “tail risk” where reported losses develop beyond the maximum expected loss emergence time period. We do not routinely determine loss reserve ranges. We believe that the techniques necessary to make such determinations have not sufficiently developed and that the myriad of assumptions required render such ranges to be unreliable. 54 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, our claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners’ estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners’ estimates are significantly greater than the ceding company’s estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACRs are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2014, ACRs aggregated approximately $2.0 billion before discounts and were concentrated in workers’ compensation reserves, and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. Our examiners also periodically conduct detailed claim reviews of individual clients and case reserves are often increased as a result. Our actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (“reserve cells”) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative and program), line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, and workers’ compensation), and jurisdiction. For each reserve cell, premiums and losses are aggregated by accident year, policy year or underwriting year (depending on client reporting practices) and analyzed over time. We internally refer to these loss aggregations as loss triangles, which serve as the basis for our IBNR reserve calculations. Globally, we review approximately 1,200 reserve cells. We use loss triangles to determine the expected case loss emergence and development patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, we calculate IBNR reserves. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, we may use loss emergence estimation formulae along with other loss triangles and actuarial judgment to determine loss emergence patterns. Factors affecting our loss development triangles include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in client claims practices, changes in claim examiners’ use of ACRs or the frequency of client company claim reviews, changes in policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. Collectively, these factors influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns. We select expected loss ratios by reserve cell and by accident year based upon indicated ultimate loss ratios and forecasted losses obtained from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are determined from the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premiums. If through subsequent development the selected loss emergence pattern proves to be inaccurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios may be inaccurate, which can then impact the selected loss ratios and the IBNR reserve. Actuarial judgment is necessary in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing statistics. We estimate IBNR reserves by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, our actuaries estimate the expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year, based on the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year. Our recorded net liabilities as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $14.8 billion and $14.9 billion, respectively. During 2014, we reduced net losses for prior years’ occurrences by $410 million and in 2013 we reduced net losses for prior years’ occurrences by $728 million. These reductions produced corresponding increases in pre-tax earnings in each year. In 2014, reported claims for prior years’ workers’ compensation losses were $219 million less than expected. However, further analysis of the workers’ compensation reserve cells by segment indicated the need for maintaining IBNR reserves. These developments precipitated an increase of $120 million in nominal IBNR reserve estimates for unreported occurrences and after adjusting for changes in reserve discounts, the net increase in workers’ compensation losses from prior years’ occurrences had a minimal impact on pre-tax earnings. To illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on significant excess-of-loss workers’ compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves of approximately $824 million and $471 million on a discounted basis at December 31, 2014. An increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. 55 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) Other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) developed favorably in 2014 relative to expectations. However, casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given year will continue in the future. For our significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells, we estimate that an increase of five points in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and a five percent increase in expected loss ratios (one percent for large international proportional reserve cells) would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $1.1 billion. This amount includes changes in assumptions used in certain U.K. motor annuity claims liabilities. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $1.1 billion. In 2014, reported claims for prior years’ property loss events were less than expected and we reduced our estimated ultimate liabilities by $287 million. However, the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses. In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (“D&O and E&O”) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected loss emergence patterns. For our large D&O and E&O reserve cells, an increase of five points in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern (for those cells where loss emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of five percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $77 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, “mass tort”) claims. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. Gross unpaid mass tort liabilities at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $1.5 billion and net of reinsurance were approximately $1.2 billion. Mass tort net claims paid were $71 million in 2014. In 2014, ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims were increased by $72 million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider “survival ratios” based on average net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. Our survival ratio was approximately 14.9 years as of December 31, 2014 and 15.6 years as of December 31, 2013. The reinsurance industry’s survival ratio for asbestos and pollution liabilities was approximately 14.2 years as of December 31, 2013. BHRG BHRG’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2014 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions. Property Casualty Total Reported case reserves $ 1,909 $ 2,618 $ 4,527 IBNR reserves 2,326 4,737 7,063 Retroactive reinsurance — 24,326 24,326 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 4,235 $ 31,681 35,916 Deferred charges and ceded reinsurance receivables (8,496 ) Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 27,420 56 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG (Continued) In general, the methodologies we use to establish BHRG’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities vary widely and encompass many of the common methodologies employed in the actuarial field today. Certain traditional methodologies such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques are utilized, as well as ground-up techniques where appropriate. Additional judgments are employed to consider changes in contract conditions and terms as well as the incidence of litigation or legal and regulatory change. Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses related to our retroactive reinsurance policies were approximately $24.3 billion, and were predominately for casualty or liability coverages. Retroactive reinsurance policies relate to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date and include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses above a contractual retention are indemnified and contracts that indemnify losses paid by the counterparty immediately after the policy effective date. These contracts may include significant exposures to asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. We do not retrocede liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts to third party reinsurers. The classification “reported case reserves” has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since such amounts are derived from ceding company reports which may employ varying definitions of “case reserves.” We review and establish loss reserve estimates in the aggregate by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing retroactive reinsurance liabilities, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. We assign judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, we reassess expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process. BHRG’s liabilities under retroactive reinsurance include estimated liabilities for environmental, asbestos and latent injury losses of approximately $12.7 billion at December 31, 2014 and $11.9 billion at December 31, 2013. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not receive consistently reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, we conduct a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data of the reinsured to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, our estimates can only be developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. Potential legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on establishing loss reserves for mass tort claims in the future. We increased ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by approximately $825 million in 2014 and $300 million in 2013. In both years, the increases primarily related to asbestos and environmental risks assumed. The increase in 2014, net of deferred charge balances adjustments related to changes in estimated timing and amount of remaining unpaid liabilities, produced charges to pre-tax earnings of approximately $450 million in 2014. In 2013, the impact of the increase on pre-tax earnings was relatively insignificant. Our aggregate net payments of retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses approximated $1.1 billion in 2014 and $1.3 billion in 2013. We currently believe that maximum losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed approximately $40 billion due to the aggregate contract limits that are applicable to most of these contracts. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also believe it unlikely that our reported year end 2014 gross unpaid losses of $24.3 billion will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15%. Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from BHRG’s property and casualty contracts, other than retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $11.6 billion as of December 31, 2014 and consisted of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties, and to a lesser extent, under individual risk contracts. These coverages included catastrophe and aviation contracts that periodically generate low frequency/high severity losses. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event. 57 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG (Continued) Under most of our non-catastrophe property and casualty treaties, liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustments expenses are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on a portfolio basis, supplemented by management’s estimates of the impact of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon management’s judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding company’s loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared. For BHRG’s property/casualty contracts other than retroactive reinsurance, we decreased estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ occurrences by approximately $889 million in 2014 and $714 million in 2013. In both years, the decreases primarily derived from lower than expected losses reported by ceding companies. These decreases produced corresponding increases in pre-tax earnings in 2014 and 2013. Derivative contract liabilities Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. Our most significant derivative contract exposures relate to equity index put option contracts written between 2004 and 2008. These contracts were entered into in over-the-counter markets. Certain elements of the terms and conditions of these contracts are not standard and we are not required to post collateral under most of these contracts. Furthermore, there is no source of independent data available to us showing trading volume and actual prices of completed transactions. As a result, the values of these liabilities are based on valuation models that we believe would be used by market participants. Such models or other valuation techniques use inputs that are observable in the marketplace, while others are unobservable. Unobservable inputs require us to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in establishing prices. We believe that the fair values produced for long-duration options are inherently subjective. The values of contracts in an actual exchange are affected by market conditions and perceptions of the buyers and sellers. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model. We determine the estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts using a Black-Scholes based option valuation model. Inputs to the model include the current index value, strike price, interest rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted average interest and dividend rates used as of December 31, 2014 were 1.5% and 3.3%, respectively, and were 2.5% and 3.6%, respectively, as of December 31, 2013. The interest rates as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 were approximately 53 basis points and 64 basis points (on a weighted average basis), respectively, over benchmark interest rates and represented our estimate of our nonperformance risk. We believe that the most significant economic risks under these contracts relate to changes in the index value component and, to a lesser degree, the foreign currency component. The Black-Scholes based model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. Our contracts have an average remaining maturity of about 6 years. The weighted average volatility used as of December 31, 2014 was approximately 20.9%, compared to 20.7% as of December 31, 2013. The weighted average volatilities are based on the volatility input for each equity index put option contract weighted by the notional value of each equity index put option contract as compared to the aggregate notional value of all equity index put option contracts. The volatility input for each equity index put option contract reflects our expectation of future price volatility. The impact on fair value as of December 31, 2014 ($4.6 billion) from changes in the volatility assumption is summarized in the table that follows. Dollars are in millions. Hypothetical change in volatility (percentage points) Hypothetical fair value Increase 2 percentage points $ 4,899 Increase 4 percentage points 5,252 Decrease 2 percentage points 4,237 Decrease 4 percentage points 3,935 For several years, we also have had exposures relating to a number of credit default contracts written involving corporate and state/municipality issuers. At December 31, 2014, our remaining exposures relate to state/municipality exposures which begin to expire in 2019. The fair values of our state/municipality contracts are generally based on pricing data and current ratings on the underlying bond issues and credit spread estimates. We monitor and review pricing data and spread estimates for consistency as well as reasonableness with respect to current market conditions. 58 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Other Critical Accounting Policies We record deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over the consideration received. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. Deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of remaining loss payments. Adjustments to deferred charge balances resulting from changes to these assumptions are determined retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were approximately $7.8 billion at December 31, 2014. Significant changes in the estimated amount and the timing of payments of unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $60.7 billion, which includes approximately $4.0 billion associated with our various acquisitions in 2014. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2014. Our review includes determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then, as required by GAAP, we estimate the fair values of the individual assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Interest Rate Risk We regularly invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire such securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur with respect to assets. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We strive to maintain high credit ratings so that the cost of our debt is minimized. We rarely utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate instruments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate instruments. 59 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Interest Rate Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that there are no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available to the issuer. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Equity Price Risk Historically, we have maintained large amounts of invested assets in exchange traded equity securities. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices and prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2014, approximately 59% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated within four companies. We often hold equity investments for long periods of time so we are not troubled by short-term price volatility with respect to our investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. We strive to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate potential liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, fair values of these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract. 60 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Equity Price Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes our equity and other investments and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. The effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates are also shown. The selected 30% hypothetical changes do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

Foreign Currency Risk We generally do not use derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency price changes primarily because of the natural hedging that occurs between assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies such as The Coca-Cola Company that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. Our net assets subject to translation are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy subsidiaries, and certain manufacturing and services subsidiaries, as well as through our investments in Heinz that are accounted for under the equity method. The translation impact is somewhat offset by transaction gains or losses on net reinsurance liabilities of certain U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies as well as the equity index put option liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries relating to contracts that would be settled in foreign currencies. Commodity Price Risk Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We utilize derivative contracts to a limited degree in managing commodity price risks, most notably at BHE. BHE’s exposures to commodities include variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold and natural gas supply for customers. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage and transmission and transportation constraints. 61 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion (Continued) Commodity Price Risk (Continued) To mitigate a portion of the risk, BHE uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Financial results would be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. The table that follows summarizes commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of BHE as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of each date. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Dollars are in millions.

Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane or act of terrorism that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. 63 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 65.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Amounts are in millions. 2015 2014 2013 Insurance – underwriting $ 1,162 $ 1,692 $ 1,995 Insurance – investment income 3,725 3,542 3,708 Railroad 4,248 3,869 3,793 Utilities and energy 2,132 1,882 1,470 Manufacturing, service and retailing 4,683 4,468 3,877 Finance and financial products 1,378 1,243 1,008 Investment and derivative gains/losses 6,725 3,321 4,337 Other 30 (145 ) (712 ) Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 24,083 $ 19,872 $ 19,476 Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. Our operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance practices, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate “tone at the top” messages to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $1.2 billion in 2015, a decline of $530 million from 2014, which reflected rising claim costs at GEICO and lower earnings from our reinsurers, partially offset by increased earnings from our other primary insurance operations. In 2014, earnings from underwriting declined $303 million compared to 2013, which was primarily due to lower earnings from reinsurance. Our railroad business generated a 9.8% increase in after-tax earnings in 2015 compared to 2014. Results in 2015 were positively impacted by improved service levels and lower fuel costs. Railroad earnings increased 2.0% in 2014 compared to 2013, although earnings were negatively impacted by various service-related challenges during the year. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy businesses in 2015 increased 13.3% over 2014, which increased 28.0% over 2013. Earnings in 2015 and 2014 benefitted from the inclusion of newly-acquired businesses (AltaLink beginning in December 2014 and NV Energy beginning in December 2013) and higher earnings from several of our other energy businesses. After-tax earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2015 increased 4.8% in the aggregate over 2014. In 2015, the positive impacts of business acquisitions and higher earnings from our building products businesses were partly offset by lower earnings from certain of our industrial products and service businesses. Earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2014 increased 15.2% over 2013, reflecting the impact of bolt-on business acquisitions, earnings growth in certain operations and reductions in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. After-tax investment and derivative gains/losses were approximately $6.7 billion in 2015, $3.3 billion in 2014 and $4.3 billion in 2013. In 2015, after-tax gains included a non-cash holding gain of approximately $4.4 billion that was realized in connection with our investment in Kraft Heinz common stock. In 2014, after-tax gains included approximately $2.0 billion related to the exchanges of Phillips 66 common stock and Graham Holdings Company common stock for a specified subsidiary of each of those companies. After-tax investment gains in 2013 included gains associated with the fair value increases of certain investment securities where unrealized gains or losses were reflected in periodic earnings. Derivative contracts contributed after-tax gains of $633 million in 2015, $329 million in 2014 and $1.7 billion in 2013. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance. These gains and losses have caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 32 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing decisions, with limited exceptions, are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to BHRG and General Re. We define pre-tax catastrophe losses in excess of $100 million from a single event or series of related events as significant. In 2015, we recorded estimated losses of $136 million in connection with a property loss event in China. In 2014, we did not incur any significant catastrophe losses. In 2013, we incurred pre-tax losses of $436 million related to two catastrophe events in Europe. Our periodic underwriting results may be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. Actual claim settlements and revised loss estimates will develop over time, which will likely differ from the liability estimates recorded as of year-end (approximately $73.1 billion). Accordingly, the unpaid loss estimates recorded as of December 31, 2015 may develop upward or downward in future periods, producing a corresponding decrease or increase to pre-tax earnings. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rates can be volatile and the resulting impact on our underwriting earnings can be relatively significant. A key marketing strategy of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. A measure of capital strength is combined shareholders’ equity determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules (“Statutory Surplus”). Statutory Surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $124 billion at December 31, 2015. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers. Underwriting results from our insurance businesses are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. 2015 2014 2013 Underwriting gain attributable to: GEICO $ 460 $ 1,159 $ 1,127 General Re 132 277 283 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 421 606 1,294 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 824 626 385 Pre-tax underwriting gain 1,837 2,668 3,089 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 675 976 1,094 Net underwriting gain $ 1,162 $ 1,692 $ 1,995 33 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO’s policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. This is a significant element in our strategy to be a low-cost auto insurer. In addition, we strive to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICO’s underwriting results are summarized below. Dollars are in millions. 2015 2014 2013 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 23,378 $ 20,962 $ 19,083 Premiums earned $ 22,718 100.0 $ 20,496 100.0 $ 18,572 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 18,647 82.1 15,924 77.7 14,255 76.7 Underwriting expenses 3,611 15.9 3,413 16.6 3,190 17.2 Total losses and expenses 22,258 98.0 19,337 94.3 17,445 93.9 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 460 $ 1,159 $ 1,127 Premiums written and earned in 2015 increased 11.5% and 10.8%, respectively, over 2014. The increases in premiums reflected growth in voluntary auto policies-in-force (5.4%) and rate increases. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2015 exceeded 2014 by about 1%. In 2015, our voluntary auto policies-in-force grew by 707,000 policies. In 2015, pre-tax underwriting gains were $460 million compared to $1.16 billion in 2014 and $1.13 billion in 2013. Throughout 2015, we experienced increases in claims frequencies and severities across all of our major coverages. Our loss ratio, which is the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned, in 2015 was 82.1% compared to 77.7% in 2014. As a result, we continue to implement premium rate increases where necessary. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2015 increased $2.7 billion (17.1%) over 2014. Claims frequencies (claim counts per exposure unit) in 2015 increased in all major coverages over 2014, including property damage and collision coverages (three to five percent range), bodily injury coverage (four to six percent range) and personal injury protection (PIP) coverage (one to two percent range). Average claims severities were also higher in 2015 for property damage and collision coverages (four to five percent range), bodily injury coverage (six to seven percent range) and PIP coverage (two to four percent range). We believe that increases in miles driven, repair costs (parts and labor) and medical costs, as well as weather conditions contributed to the increases in frequencies and severities. Underwriting expenses in 2015 increased 5.8% to $3.6 billion. The largest components of underwriting expenses are employee-related costs (salaries and benefits) and advertising. During 2015, these costs grew at a slower rate than premiums. As a result, our expense ratio (the ratio of underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in 2015 declined 0.7 percentage points compared to 2014. Premiums written and earned in 2014 increased $1.88 billion (9.8%) and $1.92 billion (10.4%), respectively, compared to premiums written and earned in 2013. These increases were attributable to an increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force of 6.6% and increased average premium per policy. Voluntary auto new business sales increased about 1.8% in 2014 as compared to 2013 and voluntary auto policies-in-force increased 821,000 policies during 2014. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2014 increased $1.7 billion (11.7%) to $15.9 billion. In 2014, claims frequencies for property damage and collision coverages increased in the three to four percent range over 2013, partially due to more severe winter weather in the first quarter of 2014. Claims frequencies for bodily injury coverage increased about one percent, while frequencies for personal injury protection decreased three to four percent. Physical damage severities increased one to two percent in 2014 and bodily injury severities decreased in the one to two percent range from severities in 2013. Overall, personal injury protection severities were relatively unchanged although we experienced relatively large, but offsetting, changes by jurisdiction. Underwriting expenses in 2014 increased $223 million (7.0%) to $3.4 billion. The increase reflected the increased policy acquisition costs to generate the growth in policies-in-force and increased other operating expenses. 34 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) General Re General Re conducts a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. We write property and casualty reinsurance in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Germany-based General Reinsurance AG and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written in broker markets through Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG. General Re strives to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines. Our management does not evaluate underwriting performance based upon market share and our underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. In 2015, we changed the allocation of certain underwriting expenses related to a global systems implementation project among our business units. There was no impact on consolidated results. Prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to current year presentations. General Re’s underwriting results are summarized in the following table. Amounts are in millions. Premiums written Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 Property/casualty $ 2,725 $ 3,257 $ 2,972 $ 2,805 $ 3,103 $ 3,007 $ 150 $ 204 $ 171 Life/health 3,165 3,161 2,991 3,170 3,161 2,977 (18 ) 73 112 $ 5,890 $ 6,418 $ 5,963 $ 5,975 $ 6,264 $ 5,984 $ 132 $ 277 $ 283 Property/casualty In 2015, property/casualty premiums written declined $532 million (16%), while premiums earned decreased $298 million (10%), as compared to 2014. Adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums written and earned in 2015 declined 9% and 2%, respectively, compared to 2014. Our premium volume declined in both the direct and broker markets worldwide. Insurance industry capacity remains high and price competition in most property/casualty reinsurance markets persists. We continue to decline business when we believe prices are inadequate. However, we remain prepared to write substantially more business when more appropriate prices can be attained relative to the risks assumed. Our property/casualty business produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $150 million in 2015 and $204 million in 2014. In 2015, our property business generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $289 million compared to $445 million in 2014. The comparative decrease in underwriting gains from property business was driven by an increase in the current accident year loss ratio, reflecting a relative increase in reported losses. The property results in 2015 included estimated incurred losses of $50 million from an explosion in Tianjin, China. There were no significant catastrophe losses during 2014. Our property business results in both years benefitted from reductions of estimated losses for prior years’ exposures. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results. In 2015 and 2014, our casualty/workers’ compensation business produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $139 million and $241 million, respectively. Underwriting results in each year included net losses on current year business, driven by our prudent reserving philosophy that reflects the inherent uncertainty in long-tail exposures. These losses were partially offset by gains from reductions of estimated losses on prior years’ business of $150 million in 2015 and $123 million in 2014, which were net of recurring charges for discount accretion on workers’ compensation liabilities and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance contracts. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given period means that the ultimate liability estimates currently established will continue to develop favorably. Premiums written and earned in 2014 increased $285 million (9.6%) and $96 million (3.2%), respectively, compared to 2013. Adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums written and earned in 2014 increased 8% and 3%, respectively, reflecting increases in treaty participations as well as growth in our facultative and primary casualty businesses. Our property/casualty business produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $204 million in 2014 and $171 million in 2013. Our property business generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $445 million in 2014 and $140 million in 2013. Underwriting results in 2013 included $400 million of catastrophe losses primarily attributable to a hailstorm ($280 million) and floods ($120 million) in Europe. In both 2014 and 2013, property results benefitted from reductions of estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ exposures. The favorable development in each period was primarily attributable to lower than expected losses reported from ceding companies. Our casualty/workers’ compensation business produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $241 million in 2014 and underwriting gains of $31 million in 2013. Casualty/workers’ compensation underwriting results included gains from reductions of estimated ultimate losses on prior years’ business of $123 million in 2014 and $354 million in 2013, which included charges related to discount accretion on workers’ compensation liabilities and amortization of deferred charges pertaining to retroactive reinsurance contracts. 35 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) General Re (Continued) Life/health In 2015, life/health premiums written and earned were relatively unchanged from 2014. However, adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums earned in 2015 increased $266 million (8%) as compared to 2014. In 2015, life business increased across a number of non-U.S. markets, particularly in Canada and Asia. Our life/health business produced aggregate pre-tax underwriting losses in 2015 of $18 million compared to gains of $73 million in 2014. In 2015, our North American long-term care business generated increased underwriting losses of $77 million compared to 2014 due primarily to increased reserves from estimated premium deficiencies. Also we experienced higher frequency and severity of losses in North American individual life business, which were partially offset by increased underwriting gains from international life business. Premiums written and earned in 2014 increased $170 million (5.7%) and $184 million (6.2%), respectively, compared to 2013. Adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums earned in 2014 increased 8% over 2013, which primarily derived from life business across a number of non-U.S. markets. Our life/health operations produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $73 million in 2014 compared to $112 million in 2013. In 2014, we increased benefit liabilities by approximately $50 million as a result of reducing discount rates for certain European long-term care and disability business. In 2014, we also experienced increased frequency and severity of claims in Australian disability business. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group BHRG underwrites excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages on property and casualty risks for insurers and reinsurers worldwide, including property catastrophe insurance and reinsurance. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce extraordinary volatility in the periodic underwriting results. Occasionally, BHRG also writes retroactive reinsurance, which provides indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events arising under property/casualty coverages. BHRG’s underwriting activities also include life reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses. BHRG’s underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in millions. Premiums written Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 Property/casualty $ 4,702 $ 4,097 $ 4,768 $ 4,416 $ 4,064 $ 5,149 $ 944 $ 1,411 $ 1,248 Retroactive reinsurance 5 3,371 328 5 3,371 328 (469 ) (632 ) (333 ) Life and annuity 2,786 2,681 3,309 2,786 2,681 3,309 (54 ) (173 ) 379 $ 7,493 $ 10,149 $ 8,405 $ 7,207 $ 10,116 $ 8,786 $ 421 $ 606 $ 1,294 Property/casualty Premiums written and earned in 2015 increased $605 million (15%) and $352 million (9%), respectively, compared to 2014. These increases were primarily attributable to a new 10-year, 20% quota-share contract with Insurance Australia Group Ltd. (“IAG”), which became effective on July 1, 2015. Partially offsetting this increase were premium declines in property catastrophe, property quota-share and London facilities business. Our premium volume is generally constrained for most property/casualty coverages, and for property catastrophe coverages in particular as rates, in our view, are inadequate. However, we have the capacity and desire to write substantially more business when appropriate pricing can be obtained. The property/casualty business generated pre-tax underwriting gains in 2015 of $944 million compared to $1.4 billion in 2014. In 2015, we incurred losses of $86 million from an explosion in Tianjin, China. There were no significant catastrophe losses in 2014. Underwriting results in 2015 included comparatively lower gains from property catastrophe reinsurance and the run off of prior years’ business. Premiums earned in 2014 were $4.1 billion, a decline of $1.1 billion (21%) compared to 2013. Premiums earned in 2014 with respect to a 20% quota-share contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. (“Swiss Re”) declined $1.3 billion from premiums earned in 2013. The Swiss Re contract expired at the end of 2012 and is in run-off. Property catastrophe premiums earned in 2014 declined $113 million (14%) as compared to 2013. These declines were partially offset by increased premiums earned from property quota-share contracts. 36 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) The property/casualty business generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $1.4 billion in 2014 compared to $1.2 billion in 2013. In each year, the underwriting gains were primarily attributable to our property business, which benefitted from relatively low loss ratios, and the favorable run-off of prior years’ business, including the Swiss Re contract. Retroactive reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events, and related claims are generally expected to be paid over long periods of time. At the inception of a contract, deferred charge assets are recorded for the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate losses payable over the premiums earned. Deferred charges are subsequently amortized over the estimated claims payment period based on estimates of the timing and amount of future loss payments. The original estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments are periodically analyzed against actual experience and revised based on an actuarial evaluation of the expected remaining losses. Amortization charges and deferred charge adjustments resulting from changes to the estimated timing and amount of future loss payments are included in periodic earnings. Premiums earned from retroactive reinsurance contracts were not significant in 2015 or 2013, whereas premiums in 2014 included $3 billion from a single contract with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (“LMIC”). Under the LMIC agreement, we reinsure substantially all of LMIC’s unpaid losses and allocated loss adjustment expense liabilities related to (a) asbestos and environmental claims from policies incepting prior to 2005 and (b) workers’ compensation claims occurrences arising prior to January 1, 2014, in excess of an aggregate retention of approximately $12.5 billion and subject to an aggregate limit of $6.5 billion. Pre-tax underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance policies were $469 million in 2015, $632 million in 2014 and $333 million in 2013. In each year, underwriting losses included deferred charge amortization and foreign currency transaction gains or losses associated with foreign currency denominated reinsurance liabilities of U.S.-based subsidiaries. In 2015 and 2014, foreign currency exchange rate movements produced decreases in liabilities, generating pre-tax gains of $150 million and $273 million, respectively. Foreign currency gains/losses were not significant in 2013. Retroactive reinsurance underwriting results were also impacted during the last two years by increases in the estimated ultimate liabilities for contracts written in prior years, partially offset by increases in related deferred charge balances. The liability increases were approximately $550 million in 2015 and $825 million in 2014. In each year, the ultimate liability increases primarily related to asbestos and environmental exposures. We also re-estimated the timing of future payments of such liabilities as part of our actuarial analysis. The increase in ultimate liabilities, net of related deferred charge adjustments, produced incremental pre-tax underwriting losses of approximately $90 million in 2015 and $450 million in 2014. Gross unpaid losses from retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $23.7 billion at December 31, 2015, $24.3 billion at December 31, 2014 and $17.7 billion at December 31, 2013. Unamortized deferred charges related to BHRG’s retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $7.6 billion at December 31, 2015, $7.7 billion at December 31, 2014 and $4.25 billion at December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2015, over 80% of unpaid losses and deferred charge balances were concentrated in six contracts. Life and annuity BHRG’s life and annuity underwriting results are summarized as follows (in millions). Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 Periodic payment annuity $ 1,286 $ 1,105 $ 1,413 $ (202 ) $ (197 ) $ (213 ) Life reinsurance 1,481 1,555 191 (45 ) (23 ) 336 Variable annuity guarantee 19 21 1,705 193 47 256 $ 2,786 $ 2,681 $ 3,309 $ (54 ) $ (173 ) $ 379 Periodic payment annuity premiums in 2015 increased 16% compared with 2014, while premiums earned in 2014 declined 22% compared to 2013. Premiums earned in 2015 and 2013 included approximately $425 million and $470 million, respectively, from a single reinsurance contract written in each year. Annuity payments under these contracts are not expected to begin for several years. 37 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Life and annuity (Continued) Periodic payment annuity contracts generated pre-tax underwriting losses of $202 million in 2015, $197 million in 2014 and $213 million in 2013. Generally, premiums under these contracts are received at inception and payments are made over time, often extending for decades. No gains or losses are recognized in earnings at the inception of these contracts. Periodic underwriting losses are primarily attributable to the recurring impact of the accretion of discounted annuity liabilities. Underwriting results in each year also included pre-tax gains from foreign currency exchange rate changes of $103 million in 2015 and $102 million in 2014 and pre-tax losses of $62 million in 2013. These gains/losses reflected changes in foreign currency denominated liabilities due to foreign currency exchange rate movements. Aggregate annuity liabilities were approximately $8.7 billion at December 31, 2015, $7.1 billion at December 31, 2014 and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2013. In 2015, life reinsurance premiums declined $74 million (5%) compared to 2014. Pre-tax underwriting losses from the life reinsurance business in 2015 were $45 million, which included losses in connection with business that was terminated. In 2013, life reinsurance underwriting results included a one-time pre-tax gain of $255 million related to an amendment to a reinsurance contract, which resulted in the reversal of premiums earned, which was more than offset by the reversal of life benefits incurred and the release of the liabilities for future losses. Our variable annuity business consists of contracts that provide guarantees on closed blocks of variable annuity business written by other insurers. Our initial contract was written in 2013 and produced premiums earned of $1.7 billion. The underwriting gains in each of the past three years reflect the impacts of changes in equity markets and interest rates which generally resulted in decreases in estimated liabilities for guaranteed minimum benefits. Periodic results from these contracts can be volatile reflecting changes in investment market conditions, which impact the underlying insured exposures. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses. These businesses include: MedPro Group, providers of healthcare malpractice insurance coverages; National Indemnity Company’s primary group (“NICO Primary”), writers of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to as Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), providers of commercial multi-line insurance, including workers’ compensation; Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), which concentrates on providing large scale insurance solutions for commercial property and casualty risks; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers’ compensation solutions; Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), providers of workers’ compensation and commercial property and casualty insurance coverages to small and mid-sized businesses; and Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and Medicare Supplement insurance. Premiums earned in 2015 and 2014 increased by approximately $1.0 billion over the corresponding prior year. The increases were primarily attributable to volume increases from BH Specialty, NICO Primary, BHHC and GUARD. The BH Primary insurers produced aggregate pre-tax underwriting gains of $824 million in 2015, $626 million in 2014 and $385 million in 2013. Combined loss ratios were 57% in 2015 and 60% in 2014 and 2013. Overall, the claim environment over the past three years has been relatively favorable. However, these primary insurers write sizable amounts of liability and workers’ compensation business, which can have extended claim tails. It should not be assumed that the current claim experience or underwriting results will continue into the future. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income generated by investments held by our insurance operations follows. Amounts are in millions. 2015 2014 2013 Interest income $ 888 $ 1,009 $ 1,693 Dividend income 3,662 3,348 3,020 Investment income before taxes and noncontrolling interests 4,550 4,357 4,713 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 825 815 1,005 Net investment income $ 3,725 $ 3,542 $ 3,708 38 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Interest earned in 2015 declined $121 million (12%) from 2014, which declined $684 million (40%) from 2013. The reductions reflected the maturities and dispositions of fixed maturity securities with higher interest rates, including $4.4 billion par amount of Wrigley 11.45% subordinated notes as a result of the repurchase of those notes by the issuer in 2013. We also continue to hold significant cash and cash equivalent balances earning very low yields. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to such balances. Dividend income in 2015 increased $314 million (9%) versus 2014, while dividend income in 2014 exceeded 2013 by $328 million (11%). The increases reflected higher dividend rates for certain of our equity holdings and increased investment levels. Beginning in 2015, dividend income included income from our investment in Restaurant Brands International, Inc. 9% Preferred Stock ($3 billion stated value), which was acquired in December 2014. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $88 billion at December 31, 2015, $84 billion at December 31, 2014 and $77 billion at December 31, 2013. The cost of float was negative over the last three years as our insurance business generated pre-tax underwriting gains in each year. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 follows. Other investments include investments in The Dow Chemical Company, Bank of America Corporation and Restaurant Brands International, Inc.

BNSF operates approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states and also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF’s major business groups are classified by type of product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. Earnings of BNSF are summarized below (in millions). 2015 2014 2013 Revenues $ 21,967 $ 23,239 $ 22,014 Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 5,043 5,023 4,651 Fuel 2,656 4,478 4,503 Purchased services 2,546 2,592 2,418 Depreciation and amortization 2,001 2,123 1,973 Equipment rents, materials and other 2,018 2,021 1,812 Total operating expenses 14,264 16,237 15,357 Interest expense 928 833 729 15,192 17,070 16,086 Pre-tax earnings 6,775 6,169 5,928 Income taxes 2,527 2,300 2,135 Net earnings $ 4,248 $ 3,869 $ 3,793 Consolidated revenues during 2015 were approximately $22.0 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion (5%), compared to 2014. Pre-tax earnings in 2015 were $6.8 billion, an increase of $606 million (10%) over 2014. Results in 2015 benefitted from significantly improved operating performance compared to substandard service during 2014. Our system velocity and on-time performance improved significantly in 2015. The operational improvements in 2015 reflected the capacity added in 2014 and 2015 through capital investments for line expansion, system improvement projects and additional equipment, other operational initiatives and more favorable winter weather conditions. Our total volume in 2015 was approximately 10.3 million cars/units. During the second half of 2015 and particularly in the fourth quarter, we experienced declining demand, especially in coal and certain industrial products categories. If conditions persist, we anticipate that volumes for these categories in 2016 may decline and our revenues and earnings may be lower than in 2015. In 2015, the decrease in overall revenues reflected a 6% decline in average revenue per car/unit and a 0.1% decrease in volume. The decrease in average revenue per car/unit in 2015 was attributable to a 55% decline in fuel surcharges ($1.6 billion) versus 2014, primarily due to lower fuel prices. The impact of lower fuel surcharge revenues affected revenues of all product lines. In 2015, freight revenues from industrial products decreased 11% from 2014 to $5.6 billion. The decrease reflected lower volumes for petroleum products, frac sand and steel products and lower average revenue per car/unit. With oil at low prices, we expect that volumes in 2016 will weaken compared to 2015. Freight revenues from agricultural products in 2015 increased 2% to approximately $4.2 billion as compared to revenues in 2014. The increase in 2015 was attributable to higher domestic grain shipments and milo exports. Freight revenues in 2015 from coal decreased 7% to $4.6 billion compared to 2014. The revenue decline was primarily due to lower average rate per car. Coal volume increased 1% in 2015 primarily due to higher demand in the early part of the year as customers restocked coal inventories. We currently believe that utility coal inventories are relatively high and there is increased usage of other fuel sources in generating electricity. As a result, we expect lower coal volume in 2016. Freight revenues from consumer products in 2015 were $6.6 billion, a decline of 6% from 2014. The revenue decline reflected lower average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by volume increases of 1%. In the first quarter of 2015, we experienced a decline in international intermodal volume attributable to diversions of freight from U.S. West Coast ports to other import gateways as a result of the port productivity slow-down from port labor disruptions. Over the remainder of 2015, we experienced increased volume, as port productivity improvements allowed the backlog to clear, and also from higher demand. 40 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Operating expenses in 2015 were $14.3 billion, a decrease of $2 billion (12%) compared to 2014. In 2015, the ratio of operating expenses to revenues declined 4.9 percentage points to 64.9% as compared to 2014. Compensation and benefits expenses were relatively flat versus 2014. In response to weakening customer demand in the latter half of 2015, employment levels were reduced. Fuel expenses in 2015 declined $1.8 billion (41%) compared to 2014, reflecting significantly lower average fuel prices, improved efficiency and lower gross ton miles volume. In 2015, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $122 million (6%) compared to 2014 as a result of lower capitalized software amortization expenses, partially offset by increased depreciation expense attributable to increased levels of railroad assets in service. Interest expense in 2015 was $928 million, an increase of $95 million (11%) compared to 2014. Interest expense in 2014 was $833 million, an increase of $104 million (14%) compared to 2013. BNSF funds its capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and new debt issuances. In each period, the increased interest expense resulted from higher average outstanding debt. Consolidated revenues in 2014 were approximately $23.2 billion, representing an increase of $1.2 billion (5.6%) over 2013. The overall increase in revenues reflected a 1.8% increase in cars/units handled and a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit. In 2014, our combined volume was approximately 10.3 million cars/units. Our rail operations were negatively affected by severe winter weather conditions during the first quarter of 2014, particularly in the Northern U.S. service territory, and from various other service issues throughout 2014. These issues resulted in slower average speeds on our system and negatively impacted volumes and revenues of each of our business groups. We experienced improvement in operating performance and freight volumes over the fourth quarter of 2014. Revenues from consumer products in 2014 were $7.0 billion, and were relatively unchanged from 2013. In 2014, unit volume and average revenues per car were relatively flat versus 2013. In 2014, our international intermodal business volume was negatively affected by congestion at U.S. West Coast ports. In 2014, revenues from industrial products increased $508 million (9%) to $6.2 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases in overall unit volume, and to a lesser extent, changes in rates and product mix. Revenues from agricultural products in 2014 increased $584 million (16%) to approximately $4.2 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to increased volume, rates and product mix changes. Also, agricultural products volume in 2013 was negatively affected by the drought conditions in 2012. In 2014, coal revenues of $5.0 billion were essentially unchanged from 2013, as a 2% increase in year-to-date unit volume was offset by a 2% decline in average rates. Operating expenses in 2014 were $16.2 billion, an increase of $880 million (6%) over 2013. A significant portion of this increase was due to increased costs related to severe weather issues and service-related challenges. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $372 million (8%) in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to increased employment levels, and to a lesser extent, wage inflation and higher overtime. Fuel expenses were relatively unchanged compared to 2013. The favorable impact from lower average fuel prices was largely offset by higher volumes. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $150 million (8%) as a result of additional assets in service. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $209 million (12%) compared to 2013 as a result of higher crew transportation and other travel costs, and increased costs of utilities. Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) We hold an 89.9% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates an international energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”), and NV Energy, which was acquired in December 2013. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE acquired AltaLink, L.P. (“AltaLink”), a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada, on December 1, 2014. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. In addition, BHE operates a diversified portfolio of independent power projects and the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest franchise networks in the United States. 41 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based, in large part, on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent these operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. Revenues and earnings of BHE are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 PacifiCorp $ 5,279 $ 5,315 $ 5,215 $ 1,026 $ 1,010 $ 982 MidAmerican Energy Company 3,459 3,818 3,453 314 298 230 NV Energy 3,382 3,279 (36 ) 586 549 (58 ) Northern Powergrid 1,141 1,284 1,026 460 527 362 Natural gas pipelines 1,018 1,093 971 401 379 385 Other energy businesses 1,416 664 292 372 236 62 Real estate brokerage 2,536 2,161 1,822 191 139 139 $ 18,231 $ 17,614 $ 12,743 Earnings before corporate interest and income taxes (“EBIT”) 3,350 3,138 2,102 Corporate interest 499 427 296 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 719 829 336 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 2,132 $ 1,882 $ 1,470 PacifiCorp PacifiCorp operates a regulated utility business in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. Revenues in 2015 declined $36 million (1%) compared to 2014. In 2015, wholesale and other revenues declined $129 million, principally due to lower wholesale prices and volumes and lower renewable energy credit revenue, while retail revenues increased compared to 2014, reflecting higher average rates partially offset by slightly lower loads. In 2015, EBIT increased $16 million (2%) compared to 2014. In 2015, gross margins (operating revenues less cost of sales) increased $109 million versus 2014, as energy costs declined more than revenues. In 2015, the increase in gross margins was substantially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense ($35 million) due to increased plant-in-service, lower allowances for equity funds used during construction ($18 million) and the impact of the recognition in 2014 of expected insurance recoveries on fire losses. Revenues in 2014 were $5.3 billion, an increase of $100 million (2%) compared to revenues in 2013. In 2014, revenues increased primarily due to higher retail rates and wholesale prices, partially offset by lower retail customer load. EBIT were $1.0 billion, an increase of $28 million (3%) over 2013. The increase in EBIT reflected the impact of the increase in operating revenues and the recognition of estimated insurance recoveries from a fire loss in 2014 (as compared to a reduction in 2013 EBIT from charges related to the fire), partially offset by increased energy costs and higher depreciation expense. The increase in depreciation expense reflected the impact of changes in depreciation rates and higher plant-in-service, including a new generation facility. MidAmerican Energy Company MEC operates a regulated utility business primarily in Iowa and Illinois. In 2015, MEC’s revenues declined $359 million (9%) from 2014. In 2015 regulated natural gas revenues declined $335 million, which was primarily attributable to lower average per-unit cost of gas sold, which is substantially offset in lower cost of sales. Regulated electric revenues in 2015 increased slightly over 2014, primarily due to higher retail rates in Iowa and higher loads, partially offset by lower average wholesale prices. The increases in Iowa regulated electric rates are attributable to higher retail rates and changes in rate structure approved in August 2014, which results in a greater differential between higher rates from June to September and lower rates in the remaining months. 42 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) MidAmerican Energy Company (Continued) MEC’s EBIT in 2015 increased $16 million (5%) compared to 2014, reflecting an increase in gross margins ($97 million), partially offset by increases in depreciation expense from new wind generation and other plant-in-service ($56 million), interest expense ($17 million), and lower allowances for equity funds used during construction ($19 million). The increase in gross margins derived primarily from the regulated electric business, which benefitted from the aforementioned changes in Iowa rates and rate structure and lower fuel and purchased power costs. Revenues in 2014 increased $365 million (11%) to $3.8 billion, reflecting increases from regulated natural gas ($172 million), regulated electric ($55 million) and nonregulated revenues ($122 million). The increase in regulated natural gas revenues was driven by higher per-unit natural gas costs, which are recovered from customers via adjustment clauses, and higher volume. The increase in regulated electric revenues was primarily due to increased retail rates. The increase in nonregulated revenues was due to higher natural gas and electricity prices and higher electricity volumes, partly offset by lower natural gas volumes. EBIT were $298 million in 2014, an increase of $68 million (30%) compared to 2013. The comparative increase in EBIT was primarily due to increased earnings from the regulated electric business, reflecting the impact of higher revenues and lower depreciation and amortization expense due to the impact of depreciation rate changes, partially offset by increased energy and operating costs. NV Energy BHE acquired NV Energy on December 19, 2013, and its results are included in our consolidated results beginning as of that date. NV Energy operates electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. Revenues and EBIT in 2015 were $3.4 billion and $586 million, respectively, representing increases of $103 million (3%) and $37 million (7%), respectively, over 2014. The increase in revenues was due primarily to higher retail electric revenues reflecting increased customers and higher loads. The increase in EBIT was attributable to an increase in gross margins ($82 million) and lower interest expense ($22 million), partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization ($31 million) and higher other operating expenses, including increased energy efficiency costs. For the December 19 through December 31, 2013 period, NV Energy’s results reflected one-time customer refunds, acquisition costs and other charges arising from the acquisition. Northern Powergrid Revenues in 2015 declined $143 million (11%) versus 2014, reflecting the adverse impact of the stronger U.S. Dollar ($90 million) and comparatively lower distribution revenues. The decline in distribution revenues reflected lower rates due mainly to the new price control period effective April 1, 2015. In 2015, EBIT declined $67 million (13%) compared to 2014, reflecting the adverse effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar and lower distribution revenues partially offset by lower interest expense ($13 million). Revenues in 2014 increased $258 million (25%) and EBIT increased $165 million (46%) as compared to 2013. The increases were due mainly to increased distribution revenues in 2014 from increased rates and favorable regulatory provisions and from the impact of the weaker U.S. Dollar. Natural Gas Pipelines Revenues in 2015 declined $75 million (7%) versus 2014, which was primarily due to lower gas sales as a result of reduced system and operational balancing activities, partially offset by higher transportation revenues. In 2015, EBIT increased $22 million (6%) as compared to 2014, as decreased costs of gas sold and lower operating expenses more than offset the decline in revenues. Revenues in 2014 increased $122 million (13%) compared to 2013. The increase reflected comparatively higher natural gas rates and volumes as a result of significantly colder weather conditions in the first quarter of 2014 in one of our pipeline company’s service territory and system rebalancing activities. EBIT in 2014 of $379 million were relatively unchanged from 2013, as the impact of higher revenues was offset by increased costs of gas sold, and higher system inspection, testing and maintenance costs. Other energy businesses Revenues of other energy businesses in 2015 increased $752 million (113%) over revenues in 2014, while EBIT increased $136 million (58%) versus 2014. Revenues and EBIT in 2015 reflect the acquisition of AltaLink on December 1, 2014. AltaLink’s revenues and EBIT in 2015 were $621 million and $170 million, respectively. The remaining increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in solar capacity placed in service. Excluding the acquisition of AltaLink, the impact of higher revenues in 2015 was more than offset by higher operating, depreciation and interest expenses. 43 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) Other energy businesses (Continued) Revenues and EBIT in 2014 from other energy businesses increased $372 million and $174 million, respectively, over revenues and EBIT in 2013. The increases were primarily attributable to increased revenues from new solar facilities as additional assets were placed in service and the acquisition of AltaLink on December 1, 2014. Real estate brokerage Real estate brokerage revenues and EBIT in 2015 increased 17% and 37%, respectively, compared to 2014. The revenue increase reflected comparative increases in closed transactions and average home prices and the impact of business acquisitions. The increase in EBIT in 2015 was primarily due to the increased revenues, net of commission expense, as well as a lower operating expense to revenue ratio as compared to 2014. Revenues of the real estate brokerage businesses increased $339 million (19%) in 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase reflected the impact of revenues from acquired businesses, partially offset by lower revenues from existing operations, due to a 6% decline in closed units and lower franchise revenues. EBIT of $139 million in 2014 were unchanged from 2013 as the increase in EBIT from acquired businesses was offset by lower EBIT from existing businesses and higher operating expenses. Corporate interest and income taxes Corporate interest includes interest on unsecured debt issued by BHE. In 2015 and 2014, corporate interest expense increased over the corresponding prior year due to new borrowings in connection with the NV Energy and AltaLink acquisitions. BHE’s consolidated effective income tax rates were approximately 16% in 2015, 23% in 2014 and 7% in 2013. In each year, BHE’s income tax rates reflect significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation in the United States. BHE’s effective rates in 2015 and 2013 included the impact of reductions in deferred income tax liabilities as a result of enacted statutory income tax rate decreases in the United Kingdom and increased deferred state income tax benefits. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, retailing and service businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 Manufacturing $ 36,136 $ 36,773 $ 34,258 $ 4,893 $ 4,811 $ 4,205 Service and retailing 71,689 60,916 59,214 2,222 1,981 1,955 $ 107,825 $ 97,689 $ 93,472 Pre-tax earnings 7,115 6,792 6,160 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 2,432 2,324 2,283 $ 4,683 $ 4,468 $ 3,877 Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of businesses that produce industrial, building and consumer products.

Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 Industrial products $ 16,760 $ 17,622 $ 16,065 $ 2,994 $ 3,159 $ 2,777 Building products 10,316 10,124 9,640 1,167 896 846 Consumer products 9,060 9,027 8,553 732 756 582 $ 36,136 $ 36,773 $ 34,258 $ 4,893 $ 4,811 $ 4,205 Aggregate revenues of our manufacturers were $36.1 billion in 2015, a decline of $637 million (2%) from 2014. Pre-tax earnings from manufacturing activities were $4.9 billion in 2015, an increase of $82 million (2%) versus 2014. In 2015, operating results of our industrial products and consumer products businesses were generally lower than earnings in 2014. Earnings of our building products businesses were higher than in 2014. Industrial products Revenues in 2015 of our industrial products manufacturers declined $862 million (5%) versus 2014. The foreign currency translation impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar produced $782 million of the comparative revenue decline. In addition, commodity cost deflation in petroleum and metals used in certain of our products resulted in lower average selling prices, in particular for specialty chemicals, metal cutting tools, copper wire and plumbing products. Certain of our businesses experienced slowing customer demand over the last half of the year as the decline in oil prices and competitive pressures resulted in significantly lower sales volumes to customers in or related to the oil and gas industry. The negative effect of foreign currency translation and lower selling prices in 2015 was partially offset by the impact of bolt-on acquisitions by Lubrizol ($433 million). Pre-tax earnings in 2015 of these businesses declined $165 million (5%) compared to 2014. The average pre-tax margin rate was 17.9% in 2015 and 2014. The comparative declines in earnings in 2015 reflected the adverse impact of the stronger U.S. Dollar, partially offset by earnings from bolt-on acquisitions, lower average commodity-based material costs, and actions taken in response to the slowing sales volumes previously referenced. Such actions address cost structures and exiting lower margin business. Our businesses expect soft market conditions in 2016 and expect to take additional actions as necessary, in response to further slowdowns in customer demand. Revenues in 2014 increased approximately $1.6 billion (10%) in comparison to 2013. The increase in revenues reflected the impact of bolt-on acquisitions by Lubrizol and Marmon (approximately $1.3 billion). In 2014, we also experienced revenue growth in several business markets, most notably for the metal cutting tools and at certain Marmon business units (commercial trailer and aftermarket brake drum products and water treatment systems). These increases were substantially offset by revenue declines from certain other Marmon business units due to lower copper prices and lower volumes in the electrical and plumbing products. Pre-tax earnings in 2014 increased $382 million (14%) over 2013 and average pre-tax margins were 17.9% in 2014 and 17.3% in 2013. The increase in earnings in 2014 was primarily due to the impact of bolt-on acquisitions ($213 million), increased sales and cost savings and restructuring initiatives. Building products Revenues in 2015 of our building products manufacturers increased $192 million (2%) over 2014. In 2015, the revenue increase reflected sales volume increases at Shaw, Johns Manville and MiTek, as well as the impact of bolt-on business acquisitions. These revenue increases were partially offset by the adverse impact of foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar ($165 million). Pre-tax earnings increased $271 million (30%) compared to 2014. The overall increase in earnings was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in revenues and lower average raw material and energy costs, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation and increased restructuring charges. Most of the comparative increases in earnings were generated by Shaw, Johns Manville and Benjamin Moore. 45 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) Revenues in 2014 were approximately $10.1 billion, an increase of 5% over 2013. Johns Manville, Acme and MiTek produced revenue increases, which were primarily due to higher sales volume, as well as from the impact of bolt-on acquisitions ($150 million). Shaw’s revenues in 2014 were relatively unchanged from 2013, reflecting the impact of the closure of the rugs division in early 2014 and lower carpet sales, offset by higher sales of hard surface flooring products. Pre-tax earnings of the building products businesses increased 6% in 2014 as compared to 2013. With the exception of Shaw, our building products businesses generated increased earnings compared to 2013. Shaw’s earnings were lower due to comparatively higher raw material costs. Consumer products Revenues of our consumer products manufacturers were approximately $9.1 billion in 2015, relatively unchanged from 2014. In 2015, Forest River’s revenues increased $217 million (6%) over 2014, due to a 4% increase in unit sales and increased average prices. Apparel revenues declined $157 million (4%) compared to 2014. In 2015, the decline in apparel revenues was attributable to generally lower sales volumes compared to 2014 and the negative impact of foreign currency translation as a result of a stronger U.S. Dollar ($113 million). Pre-tax earnings declined $24 million in 2015 (3%) compared to 2014. The decline was primarily due to a pre-tax loss in 2015 from the disposition of an unprofitable operation within Fruit of the Loom and lower earnings from our footwear businesses, partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River. Revenues were $9.0 billion in 2014, an increase of $474 million (6%) compared to 2013. The increase was driven by a 14% increase in Forest River’s revenues due to increased unit sales. Pre-tax earnings were $756 million in 2014, an increase of $174 million (30%) compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings from apparel businesses, and to a lesser extent, Forest River. Operating results of our apparel businesses benefitted from restructuring initiatives undertaken beginning in 2013, which included discontinuing unprofitable business, as well as from comparatively lower manufacturing and pension costs. The increase in Forest River’s earnings reflected the aforementioned increase in unit sales and lower unit manufacturing costs. Service and retailing Our service and retailing businesses are comprised of a large group of independently managed businesses engaged in a variety of activities. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of these operations follows (in millions). Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 Service $ 10,201 $ 9,854 $ 8,996 $ 1,156 $ 1,202 $ 1,093 Retailing 13,265 4,422 4,288 564 344 376 McLane Company 48,223 46,640 45,930 502 435 486 $ 71,689 $ 60,916 $ 59,214 $ 2,222 $ 1,981 $ 1,955 Service Our service businesses offer fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI) and provide electronic distribution services of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire). We franchise and service quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen) and publish newspapers and other publications (Buffalo News and the BH Media Group). In June 2014, we acquired a television station operating in Miami, Florida (WPLG) and in December 2014, we acquired a third party logistics services business that primarily serves the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). Revenues in 2015 increased $347 million (3.5%) as compared to 2014. The increase in revenues included a 5% increase in NetJets’ revenues and the impact of the acquisitions of Charter Brokerage and WPLG, partly offset by lower revenues from our newspapers. The increase in NetJets’ revenues was attributable to a 50% increase in aircraft sales, partially offset by lower operations revenue due primarily to lower fuel cost recoveries ($189 million) and unfavorable foreign currency effects ($105 million). 46 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service (Continued) Pre-tax earnings in 2015 declined $46 million compared to 2014. Earnings in 2015 were favorably impacted by the WPLG and Charter Brokerage acquisitions, which were more than offset by lower earnings from NetJets. Earnings declined at NetJets as the impact of increased aircraft sales margins was more than offset by increased personnel, aircraft subcontracting and maintenance expenses. A portion of the increase in personnel costs pertained to lump-sum payments made in connection with a collective bargaining agreement reached with our pilots in the fourth quarter. Revenues in 2014 increased $858 million (9.5%) over 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to comparative increases generated by NetJets, FlightSafety and TTI. The revenue increase at NetJets reflected increased flight hours as well as increased fractional aircraft sales. The revenue increase at TTI was driven by higher unit volume and, to a lesser extent, by bolt-on acquisitions. The revenue increase at FlightSafety was primarily due to increased simulator training hours. Pre-tax earnings in 2014 increased $109 million (10%) versus 2013, and was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in revenues. In addition, NetJets business benefitted from comparatively lower aircraft impairment and restructuring charges and financing expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation expense, maintenance costs and subcontracted flight expenses. Retailing Our retailing businesses include four distinct home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. In the first quarter of 2015, we acquired The Van Tuyl Group (now named Berkshire Hathaway Automotive or “BHA”) which included 81 auto dealerships located in 10 states. BHA sells new and pre-owned automobiles and offers repair and other related services and products, and includes two related insurance businesses, two auto auctions and a distributor of automotive fluid maintenance products. Our other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies, which makes and sells confectionary products through its retail stores and quantity order centers, Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools and Oriental Trading Company, a direct retailer of party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties. On April 30, 2015, we also acquired Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. Revenues of our retailing businesses in 2015 increased approximately $8.8 billion as compared to 2014. The increase reflected the impact of the BHA and Louis acquisitions, which contributed revenues of approximately $8.3 billion. Revenues of our home furnishings retailers in 2015 increased $572 million (24%) over 2014, driven by Nebraska Furniture Mart, which opened a new store in March of 2015, and from increases at R.C. Willey and Jordan’s. Retailing earnings increased $220 million in 2015 (64%) compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the BHA and Louis acquisitions. Revenues in 2014 increased $134 million (3%), while pre-tax earnings declined $32 million (8.5%) compared to 2013. The earnings decline in 2014 was primarily attributable to lower earnings from Nebraska Furniture Mart, due primarily to start-up costs related to its new store, and Pampered Chef, due to a decline in sales. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery unit”) and to restaurants (“foodservice unit”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage unit”). The grocery and foodservice units are marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins and have several significant customers, including Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven and Yum! Brands. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have a significant adverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues in 2015 increased $1.6 billion (3%) over 2014, reflecting revenue increases in the foodservice unit (6%), beverage unit (8%) and grocery unit (2%). Pre-tax earnings in 2015 increased $67 million (15%) versus 2014. Pre-tax earnings in 2015 included a gain of $19 million from the sale of a subsidiary and otherwise benefitted from lower fuel and trucking costs. 47 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) McLane Company (Continued) Revenues in 2014 increased $710 million (1.5%) compared to 2013, primarily due to revenue increases in the foodservice unit (7%) and beverage unit (11%). Pre-tax earnings in 2014 declined $51 million (10.5%) from 2013. Earnings in 2013 included a pre-tax gain of $24 million from the sale of a logistics business. Before the impact of this gain, earnings decreased 6% compared to 2013. The decline reflected slightly higher earnings from the grocery unit and beverage unit, which were more than offset by lower earnings from the foodservice unit. In 2014, our foodservice unit experienced higher processing costs and higher other operating costs which more than offset the increase in revenues. Finance and Financial Products Our finance and financial products businesses include manufactured housing and finance (Clayton Homes), transportation equipment manufacturing and leasing businesses (UTLX and XTRA, and together, “transportation equipment leasing”), as well as other leasing and financing activities. UTLX manufactures, owns and leases railcars and intermodal tank cars, and also owns and leases cranes, while XTRA owns and leases over-the-road trailers. A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. Revenues Earnings 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 Manufactured housing and finance $ 3,576 $ 3,310 $ 3,199 $ 706 $ 558 $ 416 Transportation equipment leasing 2,540 2,427 2,180 909 827 704 Other 848 789 731 471 454 444 $ 6,964 $ 6,526 $ 6,110 Pre-tax earnings 2,086 1,839 1,564 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 708 596 556 $ 1,378 $ 1,243 $ 1,008 Manufactured housing and finance Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2015 increased $266 million (8%) and $148 million (27%), respectively, compared to 2014. The revenue increase was primarily due to a 9% increase in home unit sales. The increase in earnings was primarily due to lower interest expense on borrowings, improved manufacturing results and relatively low delinquency rates and lower loss rates on loan foreclosures. The decline in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest rates and to a lesser extent lower average balances. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 95% of the installment loan portfolio was current in terms of payment status. Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2014 increased $111 million (3%) and $142 million (34%), respectively, compared to revenues and earnings in 2013. The increase in revenues was principally due to a 7% increase in homes sold over 2013. Earnings continued to benefit from lower loan loss provisions on installment loan portfolios, lower interest expense on borrowings and improved manufacturing results. The decline in loan loss provisions reflected fewer delinquencies and foreclosures, while the decline in interest expense was primarily due to lower rates. Transportation equipment leasing Transportation equipment leasing revenues in 2015 increased 5% compared to 2014. The increase reflected increased rail car lease rates, a larger fleet of rail/tank cars, higher volumes in our Australian crane business, increased over-the-road trailers on lease and gains on dispositions of trailers. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange effects attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower volumes in our North American crane leasing business due to declines in oil drilling activity. On September 30, 2015, UTLX acquired approximately 25,000 tank cars from General Electric Company’s leasing unit for a total purchase price of approximately $1.0 billion. On December 31, 2015, UTLX also completed the acquisition of several railcar repair and maintenance facilities, which will further enhance its full-service leasing, repair and maintenance network. Pre-tax earnings in 2015 increased $82 million (10%) over 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the positive impact of the revenue growth discussed above, which more than offset the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and higher railcar repair and warranty costs and depreciation expense attributable to a larger fleet size. A significant portion of the transportation leasing business costs such as depreciation, do not vary proportionately to revenue changes and therefore changes in revenues can disproportionately impact earnings. 48 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Finance and Financial Products (Continued) Transportation equipment leasing (Continued) Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2014 from our transportation equipment leasing businesses were $2.4 billion and $827 million, respectively, which exceeded revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2013 by 11% and 17%, respectively. The earnings increase reflected a 9% increase in aggregate lease revenues, primarily due to increased units on lease and higher lease rates for railcars. Other Other earnings from finance activities include CORT furniture leasing, our share of the earnings of a commercial mortgage servicing business (“Berkadia”) in which we own a 50% joint venture interest, and interest and dividends from a portfolio of investments. In 2015, the increase in other earnings compared to 2014 reflected increased earnings from investment securities and CORT, partially offset by lower earnings from Berkadia. In addition, other earnings includes income from interest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes on borrowings by a Berkshire financing subsidiary that are used to fund installment loans made by Clayton Homes and debt guarantee fees charged to NetJets. Corresponding expenses are included in Clayton Homes’ and NetJets’ results. Guarantee fees and interest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes and NetJets were $63 million in 2015, $70 million in 2014, and $89 million in 2013. Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows. Amounts are in millions. 2015 2014 2013 Investment gains/losses $ 9,399 $ 4,272 $ 4,293 Other-than-temporary impairments (26 ) (697 ) (228 ) Derivative gains/losses 974 506 2,608 Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 10,347 4,081 6,673 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 3,622 760 2,336 Net gains/losses $ 6,725 $ 3,321 $ 4,337 Investment gains/losses Investment gains/losses arise primarily from the sale, redemption or exchange of investments or when investments are carried at fair value with the periodic changes in fair values recorded in earnings. The timing of gains or losses can have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses included in earnings usually have minimal impact on the periodic changes in our consolidated shareholders’ equity since most of our investments are recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical or predictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will have on our reported earnings. Although we do not consider investment gains and losses in a given period as necessarily meaningful or useful in evaluating periodic earnings, we are providing information to explain the nature of such gains and losses when reflected in earnings. Pre-tax investment gains in 2015 included non-cash holding gains related to our investment in Kraft Heinz of $6.8 billion, as well as net gains from dispositions of equity and fixed maturity securities of approximately $2.5 billion. In connection with its acquisition of Kraft Foods on July 2, 2015, Kraft Heinz issued new shares of its common stock in exchange for the outstanding shares of Kraft Foods common stock, thus reducing Berkshire’s ownership interest in Kraft Heinz by approximately 50%. Under the equity method of accounting, such transactions are treated by the investor as if it sold a portion of its interests. For additional information see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Pre-tax investment gains in 2014 were $4.3 billion, which included gains of approximately $2.1 billion realized in connection with the exchanges of common stock of Phillips 66 and Graham Holdings Company for 100% of the common stock of a specified subsidiary of each of those companies. Each exchange transaction was structured as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, no income taxes are payable on the excess of the fair value of the businesses received over the tax-basis of the common stock of Phillips 66 and Graham Holdings Company exchanged. 49 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) Investment gains/losses (Continued) Pre-tax investment gains/losses in 2013 were $4.3 billion and included approximately $2.1 billion related to our investments in General Electric and Goldman Sachs common stock warrants and Wrigley subordinated notes. Beginning in 2013, the unrealized gains or losses associated with the warrants were included in earnings. These warrants were exercised in October 2013 on a cashless basis in exchange for shares of General Electric and Goldman Sachs common stock with an aggregate value of approximately $2.4 billion. The Wrigley subordinated notes were repurchased for cash of $5.08 billion, resulting in a pre-tax investment gain of $680 million. Other-than-temporary impairments (“OTTI”) OTTI charges in 2015 were not significant and in 2014 were $697 million, which predominantly related to our investments in equity securities of Tesco PLC. OTTI charges in 2013 related to our investments in Texas Competitive Electric Holdings bonds. Although we have periodically recorded OTTI charges in earnings in past years, we continue to hold some of those securities. If the market values of those investments increase following the date OTTI charges are recorded in earnings, the increases are not reflected in earnings but are instead included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. When recorded, OTTI charges have no impact whatsoever on the asset values otherwise recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets or on our consolidated shareholders’ equity. In addition, the recognition of such losses in earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income does not necessarily indicate that sales are planned and sales ultimately may not occur for a number of years. Furthermore, the recognition of OTTI charges does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is permanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, consolidated gross unrealized losses on our investments in equity and fixed maturity securities determined on an individual purchase lot basis were approximately $3.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. We have concluded that as of December 31, 2015, these unrealized losses were not other than temporary. We consider several factors in determining whether or not impairments are deemed to be other than temporary, including the current and expected long-term business prospects and if applicable, the creditworthiness of the issuer, our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers and the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline. Derivative gains/losses Derivative gains/losses primarily represent the changes in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contracts. Periodic changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying credit and equity markets. In 2015, equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax gains of approximately $1.0 billion, which were primarily attributable to the impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar and shorter remaining durations. As of December 31, 2015, the intrinsic value of these contracts was approximately $1.1 billion and the fair value of our recorded liabilities was approximately $3.55 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates, which begin in 2018, and will be based on the intrinsic value, as defined under the contracts. We have made no loss payments to date. Our remaining credit default contract produced a pre-tax loss in 2015 of $34 million. The loss represents an increase in the estimated fair value of our recorded liabilities during the period, reflecting changes in credit spreads, interest rates and remaining durations of the underlying exposures. There were no loss payments over the three years ending December 31, 2015. In 2014, derivative contracts produced pre-tax gains of $506 million. The change in the fair value of our credit default contract during 2014 produced a pre-tax gain of $397 million, and was attributable to lower credit spreads. Equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax gains of $108 million in 2014. Such gains reflected the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and generally higher index values, partially offset by the negative impact of lower interest rate assumptions. In 2013, derivative contracts generated pre-tax gains of $2.6 billion, including gains of $2.8 billion from equity index put option contracts and a loss of $213 million from our credit default contract. The gains from equity index put option contracts were due to changes in fair values of the contracts as a result of overall higher equity index values, favorable currency movements and modestly higher interest rate assumptions. The credit default contract loss was primarily attributable to wider credit spreads. 50 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other Other earnings includes corporate income (including income from our investments in Kraft Heinz) and expenses and income taxes not allocated to operating businesses. Our investments in Kraft Heinz generated earnings before allocated corporate taxes of $730 million in 2015, $694 million in 2014 and $146 million in 2013, which included significant dividends received on our Preferred Stock investment and equity method earnings on our common stock investment. Also included in other earnings are amortization of fair value adjustments made in connection with several prior business acquisitions (primarily related to the amortization of identifiable intangible assets) and corporate interest expense. These two charges (after-tax) aggregated $708 million in 2015, $682 million in 2014 and $514 million in 2013. Financial Condition Our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2015 was $255.6 billion, an increase of $15.4 billion since December 31, 2014. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in 2015 were $24.1 billion, which was partially offset by approximately $8.8 billion of net losses in other comprehensive income primarily related to changes in unrealized investment appreciation and the impact of foreign currency translation. At December 31, 2015, insurance and other businesses held cash and cash equivalents of $61.2 billion, and investments (excluding our investments in Kraft Heinz) of $152.2 billion. We used cash of approximately $4.9 billion in 2015 to fund business acquisitions. On July 1, 2015, Berkshire used cash of approximately $5.3 billion to acquire additional shares of Kraft Heinz common stock. In 2015, Berkshire Hathaway parent company issued €3.0 billion in senior unsecured notes consisting of €750 million of 0.75% senior notes due in 2023, €1.25 billion of 1.125% senior notes due in 2027 and €1.0 billion of 1.625% senior notes due in 2035. During 2015, parent company senior notes of $1.7 billion matured and were repaid. Over the next twelve months, $1.05 billion of parent company senior notes will mature, including $300 million that matured in February 2016. Our various insurance and non-insurance businesses continued to generate significant cash flows from operations. On January 29, 2016 we completed our acquisition of Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). At that time, we acquired all outstanding PCC shares of common stock, other than the shares already owned (about 2.7 million shares or 1.96%), for aggregate consideration of approximately $32 billion. We funded the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and $10 billion borrowed under a new 364-day revolving credit agreement. See Note 22 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. We currently expect to issue new term debt in 2016 and use the proceeds to repay the revolving credit loan. Berkshire’s Board of Directors has authorized Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B common shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares at management’s discretion and there is no obligation to repurchase any shares. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. Repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash and cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. There were no share repurchases under the program in 2015. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. In 2015, aggregate capital expenditures of these businesses were approximately $11.6 billion, including $5.9 billion by BHE and $5.7 billion by BNSF. BNSF and BHE forecast additional aggregate capital expenditures of approximately $8.7 billion in 2016. Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded from cash flows from operations and debt issuances. 51 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) In 2015, BNSF issued $2.5 billion of senior unsecured debentures, consisting of $850 million of debentures due in 2025 and $1.65 billion of debentures due in 2045. In 2015, BNSF also issued $500 million of amortizing debt with a final maturity date of 2028, which is secured with locomotives. BNSF’s outstanding debt was approximately $21.7 billion as of December 31, 2015, an increase of $2.5 billion from December 31, 2014. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries, excluding borrowings from Berkshire insurance subsidiaries, were approximately $36.0 billion as of December 31, 2015, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2014. In 2015, BHE issued debt of approximately $2.5 billion which was substantially offset by debt repayments and the effect of the stronger U.S. Dollar on its non-dollar denominated debt. BNSF and BHE aggregate debt and capital lease obligations maturing within the next twelve months are $2.5 billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BHE or BNSF or any of their subsidiaries. Finance and financial products assets were approximately $39.0 billion as of December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $5.5 billion since December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents. Finance assets also include loans and finance receivables, equity securities and various types of equipment and furniture held for lease, including tank cars acquired from General Electric Company’s leasing unit on September 30, 2015 for approximately $1.0 billion. Finance and financial products liabilities were approximately $17.2 billion as of December 31, 2015, a decrease of approximately $1.7 billion compared to December 31, 2014. The reduction in liabilities during 2015 was primarily attributable to a reduction in liabilities of derivative contracts and notes payable and other borrowings. Notes payable and other borrowings were approximately $11.95 billion as of December 31, 2015, a decline of $779 million compared to year-end 2014. As of December 31, 2015, notes payable included $10.7 billion of senior notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). In 2015, $1.5 billion of BHFC debt matured and BHFC issued $1.0 billion of new floating rate senior notes of which $400 million mature in 2017 and $600 million mature in 2018. An additional $1.0 billion of BHFC senior notes mature within the next twelve months. The proceeds from the BHFC senior notes are used to fund loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes. We currently intend to issue additional notes in 2016 through BHFC to fund a portion of assets held for lease of our rail tank car business, UTLX Company. The amount of debt to be issued and related maturities will be determined based on prevailing market conditions. In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Reform Act”) was signed into law. The Reform Act reshapes financial regulations in the United States by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and market participants and providing new enforcement powers to regulators. Virtually all major areas of the Reform Act have been subject to extensive rulemaking proceedings being conducted both jointly and independently by multiple regulatory agencies, some of which have been completed and others that are expected to be finalized during the next several months. Although the Reform Act may adversely affect some of our business activities, it is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as minimum rentals under operating leases and certain purchase obligations, and are not currently reflected in the financial statements. Such obligations will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred were not included in the following table to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date. The timing and/or amount of the payments under certain contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table that follows. Most significantly, the timing and amount of payments arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future claim settlement activities or events. In addition, obligations arising under life, annuity and health insurance benefits are contingent on future premiums, allowances, mortality, morbidity, expenses and policy lapse rates, as applicable. These amounts are based on the liability estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. Although certain insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and life, annuity and health benefits are ceded under reinsurance contracts, receivables recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are not reflected in the table. 52 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Contractual Obligations (Continued) A summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 follows.

Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Property and casualty losses A summary of our consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Amounts are in millions. Gross unpaid losses Net unpaid losses * Dec. 31, 2015 Dec. 31, 2014 Dec. 31, 2015 Dec. 31, 2014 GEICO $ 13,743 $ 12,207 $ 12,752 $ 11,402 General Re 14,124 14,790 13,384 14,006 BHRG 35,413 35,916 27,064 27,420 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 9,864 8,564 8,950 7,761 Total $ 73,144 $ 71,477 $ 62,150 $ 60,589 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges on reinsurance assumed. We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. Except for certain workers’ compensation claims, all liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as “gross unpaid losses”) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used in establishing these liabilities and all techniques require significant judgments and assumptions. We utilize processes and techniques that are believed to best suit the underlying claims and available data. As of any balance sheet date, recorded liabilities include provisions for reported claims (referred to as “case reserves”) and claims that have not been reported (referred to as incurred but not yet reported (“IBNR”) reserves). The time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement or payment date is referred to as the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within a few years of occurrence. Casualty losses usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contributes to extending claim-tails. 53 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Reinsurance receivables are recorded for losses recoverable from third parties and are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses. Reinsurance receivables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders. Additional information regarding those processes and techniques of our significant insurance businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows. GEICO GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. GEICO’s gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities as of December 31, 2015 were $13.7 billion compared to $12.2 billion as of December 31, 2014. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims (or a “ground-up” approach), which yield an aggregate estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. The key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We establish and evaluate unpaid loss liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The significant components of recorded liabilities at December 31, 2015 included $9.7 billion of reported average, case and case development reserves and $4.0 billion of IBNR reserves. Our recorded liabilities are affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. We use statistical techniques to analyze historical claims data and adjust when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. We analyze claims data a number of ways, including by rated state, reporting date and occurrence date. We establish average reserves for reported new auto damage and liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. Average reserves represent our estimated liabilities for claims when our adjusters have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of relatively minor physical damage claims that are paid within a relatively short time after being reported. Aggregate average reserves are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened. We generally establish individual liability claim case loss reserve estimates once the facts and merits of each claim are evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised over time as information becomes available. Approximately 92% of GEICO’s claim liabilities as of December 31, 2015 related to automobile liability coverages, of which bodily injury (“BI”) coverage accounted for approximately 55%. Liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as BI, uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of protracted litigation, and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is first established. Case reserves alone insufficiently measure the ultimate claim cost, so we establish additional case development reserve estimates, which are usually percentages of the case reserves. As of December 31, 2015, case development reserves averaged approximately 25% of the case reserves. Case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves and are reviewed and revised periodically. For unreported claims, IBNR reserves are estimated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical quarterly and monthly claim counts to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are deducted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of estimated unreported claims is then multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as new or changing legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, we may establish supplemental IBNR reserves in these situations. For significant coverages, we test the adequacy of the aggregate liabilities for unpaid losses using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability estimates recorded at the end of 2014 developed downward by $147 million when reevaluated through December 31, 2015. The downward revisions produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2015, which was approximately 0.7% of earned premiums and 1.3% of prior year-end recorded net liabilities. In 2014, estimated liabilities for pre-2014 occurrences developed downward $386 million or 3.6% of net liabilities at December 31, 2013. Assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2015 were modified as appropriate to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated. 54 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) We believe it is reasonably possible that the average BI severities will change by at least one percentage point from the severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2015. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $205 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. GEICO’s exposure to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining liabilities associated with such exposures are currently an immaterial component of GEICO’s aggregate reserves (approximately 1.0%). General Re and BHRG Liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses of General Re and BHRG derive primarily from reinsurance contracts. In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than under primary insurance policies. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk), per occurrence excess or retroactive reinsurance contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract, if reinsurer personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. However, loss information related to aggregate excess-of-loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Loss information may be reported in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is usually provided through periodic reports, which may include currently recoverable losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers. The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is typically delayed compared to primary insurers. Periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies. In the U.S., such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. Outside the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices vary. In certain countries, clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. In some instances, reinsurers assume and cede parts of an underlying risk thereby creating multiple contractual intermediaries between General Re or BHRG and the primary insured. In these instances, the claim reporting delays can be compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, and the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance contract and for other reasons. Premium and loss data is provided through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data reported to us is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Generally, BHRG and General Re are contractually permitted to access the ceding company’s books and records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the accuracy and completeness of the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes with clients occasionally arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through the involvement of our claims personnel and the appropriate client personnel or through independent outside counsel. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or an alternative dispute resolution process will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 55 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re General Re’s gross and net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and gross reserves by major line of business as of December 31, 2015 are summarized below. Amounts are in millions. Type Line of business Reported case reserves $ 6,937 Workers’ compensation (1) $ 2,542 IBNR reserves 7,187 Auto liability 3,749 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 14,124 General liability and other casualty (2) 4,230 Ceded reinsurance receivables and deferred charges (740 ) Mass tort-asbestos/environmental 1,519 Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 13,384 Property 2,084 Total $ 14,124 (1) Net of discounts of $1,579 million. (2) Includes directors and officers, errors and omissions, medical malpractice and umbrella coverage. General Re’s loss reserve estimation process is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case loss estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (“ACRs”) and IBNR reserves. The critical processes involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the determination of expected ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and the comparison of incurred losses reporting trends to the expected loss reporting patterns by actuarial personnel. Recorded liabilities are subject to “tail risk” where reported losses develop beyond the expected loss emergence time period. We do not routinely determine loss reserve ranges. We believe that the techniques necessary to make such determinations have not sufficiently developed to render meaningful estimates of such ranges. Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, we independently evaluate loss amounts. In some cases, our estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If our estimates are significantly greater than the ceding company’s estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, we establish ACRs above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2015, ACRs aggregated approximately $2.4 billion before discounts and were concentrated in workers’ compensation reserves, and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. We also periodically conduct detailed claim reviews of individual clients and case reserves may be increased as a result. We classify all loss and premium data into segments (“reserve cells”) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative and program), line of business (e.g., auto liability, property and workers’ compensation) and jurisdiction. For each reserve cell, premiums and losses are aggregated by accident year, policy year or underwriting year and analyzed over time. We internally refer to these loss aggregations as loss triangles, which serve as the basis for our IBNR reserve calculations. Globally, we review approximately 1,200 reserve cells. We use loss triangles to determine the expected case loss emergence and development patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident, policy or underwriting year, we calculate IBNR reserves. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, we may use loss emergence estimation formulae along with other loss triangles and actuarial judgment to determine loss emergence patterns. Factors affecting our loss development triangles include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims practices; our use of ACRs or the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends, and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns. We select expected loss ratios by reserve cell and by accident, policy or underwriting year based upon indicated ultimate loss ratios and forecasted losses obtained from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are determined from the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premiums. If the selected loss emergence pattern proves to be unreasonable, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios may be unreasonable, which can then impact the selected loss ratios and the IBNR reserve. Judgment is necessary in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and pricing statistics. 56 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) We estimate IBNR reserves by reserve cell using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, we estimate the expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year, based on the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year. During 2015 and 2014, we reduced net losses for prior years’ occurrences by $410 million. These reductions produced corresponding increases in pre-tax earnings in each year. In 2015, reported claims for prior years’ workers’ compensation losses were $178 million less than expected. However, further analysis of the workers’ compensation reserve cells by segment indicated the need for maintaining IBNR reserves, which precipitated an increase of $78 million in nominal IBNR reserve. After adjusting for changes in reserve discounts, the net increase in workers’ compensation losses from prior years’ occurrences had a minimal impact on pre-tax earnings. To illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on significant excess-of-loss workers’ compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves of approximately $844 million and $487 million on a discounted basis at December 31, 2015. An increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. Other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) developed favorably in 2015 relative to expectations. However, casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given year will continue in the future. For our significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells, we estimate that an increase of five points in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and a five percent increase in expected loss ratios (one percent for large international proportional reinsurance reserve cells) would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $1.1 billion. This amount includes changes in assumptions used in certain U.K. motor annuity claims liabilities. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $1.1 billion. In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (“D&O and E&O”) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected loss emergence patterns. For our large D&O and E&O reserve cells, an increase of five points in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern (for those cells where loss emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of five percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $72 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, “mass tort”) claims. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. Mass tort net claims paid in 2015 were $83 million and we increased ultimate loss estimates for such claims by $87 million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider “survival ratios” based on average net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. Our survival ratio was approximately 15.1 years as of December 31, 2015 and 14.9 years as of December 31, 2014. The reinsurance industry’s survival ratio for asbestos and pollution liabilities was approximately 14.0 years as of December 31, 2014. In 2015, reported claims for prior years’ property loss events were less than expected and we reduced our estimated ultimate liabilities by $260 million. However, the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses. 57 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG BHRG’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions. Property Casualty Total Reported case reserves $ 1,634 $ 2,606 $ 4,240 IBNR reserves 2,736 4,705 7,441 Retroactive reinsurance — 23,732 23,732 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 4,370 $ 31,043 35,413 Deferred charges and ceded reinsurance receivables (8,349 ) Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 27,064 In general, we use a variety of actuarial methodologies to establish unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities. Certain methodologies, such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, are utilized, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate. A large percentage of BHRG’s aggregate reserves derive from retroactive reinsurance contracts. Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to such contracts were approximately $23.7 billion at December 31, 2015, and were predominately for casualty or liability coverages. Retroactive reinsurance policies relate to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date and include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses above a contractual retention are indemnified and contracts that indemnify losses paid by the counterparty immediately after the policy effective date. These contracts may include significant exposures to asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. The classification “reported case reserves” has no practical analytical value with respect to our retroactive policies. We review and establish loss reserve estimates in the aggregate by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing retroactive reinsurance liabilities, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. We assign judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, we reassess expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process. BHRG’s liabilities under retroactive reinsurance include estimated liabilities for environmental, asbestos and latent injury losses of approximately $12.4 billion at December 31, 2015. We do not receive consistently reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims data from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, we conduct a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, our estimates are developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on the ultimate liabilities for mass tort claims. We increased ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by approximately $550 million in 2015. The increases primarily related to asbestos and environmental risks assumed. The increase, net of deferred charge balances adjustments related to changes in estimated timing and amount of remaining unpaid liabilities, produced charges to pre-tax earnings of approximately $90 million. We paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of approximately $1.2 billion in 2015 with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts. We currently believe that maximum losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed approximately $40 billion due to the aggregate contract limits that are applicable to most of these contracts. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that our reported year end 2015 gross unpaid losses of $23.7 billion will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15%. 58 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG (Continued) Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities related to property and casualty contracts, other than retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $11.7 billion as of December 31, 2015 and consisted of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties, and to a lesser extent, under individual risk contracts. These coverages included catastrophe and aviation contracts that periodically generate low frequency/high severity losses. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event. Under most of our non-catastrophe property and casualty treaties, liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustments expenses are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on a portfolio basis, supplemented by management’s estimates of the impact of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon management’s judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding company’s loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared. For BHRG’s property/casualty contracts other than retroactive reinsurance, we decreased estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ occurrences by approximately $728 million in 2015, which primarily derived from lower than expected losses reported by ceding companies. The decrease produced a corresponding increase in pre-tax earnings. Derivative contract liabilities Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. Our most significant derivative contract exposures relate to equity index put option contracts written between 2004 and 2008. These contracts were entered into in over-the-counter markets. We believe that the fair values produced for long-duration options are inherently subjective. The values of contracts in an actual exchange are affected by market conditions and perceptions of the buyers and sellers. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model. We determine the estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts using a Black-Scholes based option valuation model. Inputs to the model include the current index value, strike price, interest rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted average interest and dividend rates used as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were 1.5% and 3.3%, respectively. The interest rates as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately 63 basis points and 53 basis points (on a weighted average basis), respectively, over benchmark interest rates and represented our estimate of our nonperformance risk. We believe that the most significant economic risks under these contracts relate to changes in the index value component and, to a lesser degree, the foreign currency component. The Black-Scholes based model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. Our contracts have an average remaining maturity of about 5 years. The weighted average volatility used as of December 31, 2015 was approximately 21.0%, compared to 20.9% as of December 31, 2014. The weighted average volatilities are based on the volatility input for each contract weighted by the contract notional value. The volatility input for each contract reflects our expectation of future price volatility. The impact on fair value as of December 31, 2015 ($3.6 billion) from changes in the volatility assumption is summarized in the table that follows. Dollars are in millions. Hypothetical change in volatility Hypothetical fair value Increase 2 percentage points $ 3,836 Increase 4 percentage points 4,132 Decrease 2 percentage points 3,284 Decrease 4 percentage points 3,033 For several years, we also wrote a number of credit default contracts involving corporate and state/municipality issuers. At December 31, 2015, our remaining exposures relate to state/municipality exposures which begin to expire in 2019. The fair value of our state/municipality contract is generally based on pricing data and current ratings on the underlying bond issues and credit spread estimates. We monitor and review pricing data and spread estimates for consistency as well as reasonableness with respect to current market conditions. 59 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other Critical Accounting Policies We record deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over the consideration received. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. Deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of remaining loss payments. Adjustments to deferred charge balances resulting from changes to these assumptions are determined retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were approximately $7.7 billion at December 31, 2015. Significant changes in the estimated amount and the timing of payments of unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $62.7 billion. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2015. Our review includes determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then, as required by GAAP, we estimate the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Equity Price Risk Historically, we have maintained large amounts of invested assets in exchange traded equity securities. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices and prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2015, approximately 59% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated within four companies. We often hold equity investments for long periods of time so we are not troubled by short-term price volatility with respect to our investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. We strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, fair values of these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract. 60 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Equity Price Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes our equity and other investments and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates are also shown. The selected 30% hypothetical changes do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

Interest Rate Risk We regularly invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire such securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur with respect to assets. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We strive to maintain high credit ratings so that the cost of our debt is minimized. We rarely utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate instruments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate instruments. 61 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Interest Rate Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that there are no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available to the issuer. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Foreign Currency Risk Certain of our subsidiaries operate in foreign jurisdictions and we transact business in foreign currencies. We generally do not use derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency price changes primarily because of the natural hedging that occurs between assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies such as The Coca-Cola Company that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. Our net assets subject to translation are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and services subsidiaries, as well as through our investment in Kraft Heinz common stock that is accounted for under the equity method. The translation impact is somewhat offset by transaction gains or losses on net reinsurance liabilities of certain U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies as well as the equity index put option liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries relating to contracts that would be settled in foreign currencies. 62 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Commodity Price Risk Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We utilize derivative contracts to a limited degree in managing commodity price risks, most notably at BHE. BHE’s exposures to commodities include variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold and natural gas supply for customers. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage and transmission and transportation constraints. To mitigate a portion of the risk, BHE uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Financial results would be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. The table that follows summarizes commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of BHE as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of each date. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Dollars are in millions.

Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane or act of terrorism that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. 63 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 65.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (in millions). 2016 2015 2014 Insurance – underwriting $ 1,370 $ 1,162 $ 1,692 Insurance – investment income 3,636 3,725 3,542 Railroad 3,569 4,248 3,869 Utilities and energy 2,287 2,132 1,882 Manufacturing, service and retailing 5,631 4,683 4,468 Finance and financial products 1,427 1,378 1,243 Investment and derivative gains/losses 6,497 6,725 3,321 Other (343 ) 30 (145 ) Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 24,074 $ 24,083 $ 19,872 Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance practices, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate “tone at the top” messages to employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $1.4 billion in 2016, an increase of $208 million from 2015, primarily due to increased earnings from Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group and General Re, partly offset by lower net underwriting gains from primary insurance. Our railroad business generated lower net earnings in 2016, primarily due to a 5.0% decline in unit volume. Earnings of our utilities and energy businesses increased in 2016, attributable to increased pre-tax earnings and a lower effective income tax rate. The increase in after-tax earnings in 2016 as compared to 2015 of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses was primarily due to earnings from PCC, partly offset by comparatively lower overall earnings from the other businesses within this group. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $1.2 billion in 2015, a decline of $530 million from 2014, which reflected rising claim costs at GEICO and lower earnings from our reinsurers, partially offset by increased earnings from our other primary insurance operations. Our railroad business generated a 9.8% increase in after-tax earnings in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting improved service levels and lower fuel costs. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy businesses in 2015 increased 13.3% over 2014, attributable to the acquisition of AltaLink in December 2014 and higher earnings from several of our other energy businesses. After-tax earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2015 increased 4.8% over 2014. The positive impacts of business acquisitions and higher earnings from our building products businesses were partly offset by lower earnings from certain of our industrial products and service businesses. After-tax investment and derivative gains were approximately $6.5 billion in 2016, $6.7 billion in 2015 and $3.3 billion in 2014. After-tax investment gains in 2016 included approximately $2.7 billion from the disposition or conversion of our Wrigley, Kraft Heinz and Dow preferred stock investments and non-cash gains of approximately $1.9 billion related to the exchange of P&G common stock for 100% of the common stock of Duracell. After-tax investment and derivative gains in 2015 included non-cash holding gains of approximately $4.4 billion in connection with our investment in Kraft Heinz common stock. In 2014, after-tax gains included approximately $2.0 billion related to the exchanges of Phillips 66 common stock and Graham Holdings Company common stock for a specified subsidiary of each of those companies. Derivative contracts contributed after-tax gains of $488 million in 2016, $633 million in 2015 and $329 million in 2014. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance. Investment and derivative gains and losses have caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 32 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, General Re, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing decisions, with limited exceptions, are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to BHRG and General Re. Our periodic underwriting results may be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. Actual claim settlements and revised loss estimates will develop over time, which will likely differ from the liabilities recorded as of year-end 2016 of approximately $76.9 billion. Accordingly, the unpaid loss estimates recorded as of December 31, 2016 will develop upward or downward in future periods, producing a corresponding decrease or increase to pre-tax earnings. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rates can be volatile and the resulting impact on our underwriting earnings can be relatively significant. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (in millions). 2016 2015 2014 Underwriting gain attributable to: GEICO $ 462 $ 460 $ 1,159 General Re 190 132 277 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 822 421 606 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 657 824 626 Pre-tax underwriting gain 2,131 1,837 2,668 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 761 675 976 Net underwriting gain $ 1,370 $ 1,162 $ 1,692 GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO’s policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. GEICO’s underwriting results are summarized below (in millions). 2016 2015 2014 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 26,309 $ 23,378 $ 20,962 Premiums earned $ 25,483 100.0 $ 22,718 100.0 $ 20,496 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 21,044 82.6 18,647 82.1 15,924 77.7 Underwriting expenses 3,977 15.6 3,611 15.9 3,413 16.6 Total losses and expenses 25,021 98.2 22,258 98.0 19,337 94.3 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 462 $ 460 $ 1,159 33 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Premiums written in 2016 increased 12.5% to $26.3 billion and premiums earned increased approximately $2.8 billion (12.2%) compared to 2015. These increases reflected voluntary auto policy-in-force growth of 7% and increased average premiums per auto policy resulting from rate increases, changes in coverage and state and risk mix. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2016 increased 10.9% compared to the prior year. The growth in voluntary auto new business accelerated over the last half of 2016 and, for the year, voluntary auto policies-in-force increased 974,000. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2016 increased $2.4 billion (12.9%) to $21.0 billion. In 2016, our loss ratio (the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to earned premiums) increased 0.5 percentage points, reflecting increased storm losses and claims severity, partly offset by the aforementioned premium rate increases. Claims frequencies (claim counts per exposure unit) in 2016 for property damage, collision, bodily injury and personal injury protection (PIP) coverages were relatively unchanged from 2015. Average claims severities were higher in 2016 for bodily injury, physical damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range). In addition, storm-related losses (primarily from hail and flooding) in 2016 were approximately $423 million compared to $162 million in 2015. Underwriting expenses in 2016 were $4.0 billion, an increase of $366 million (10.1%) over 2015. Our expense ratio (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in 2016 decreased 0.3 percentage points compared to 2015. The largest components of underwriting expenses are employee-related expenses (salaries and benefits) and advertising costs. The increase in underwriting expenses reflected the increase in policies-in-force. Premiums written and earned in 2015 increased 11.5% and 10.8% over 2014. The increases in premiums reflected growth in voluntary auto policies-in-force (5.4%) and rate increases. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2015 exceeded 2014 by about 1%. In 2015, our voluntary auto policies-in-force grew by 707,000 policies. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2015 increased $2.7 billion (17.1%) over 2014. Our loss ratio was 82.1% in 2015 compared to 77.7% in 2014. Claims frequencies in 2015 increased in all major coverages over 2014, including property damage and collision coverages (three to five percent range), bodily injury coverage (four to six percent range) and PIP (one to two percent range). Average claims severities were also higher in 2015 for property damage and collision coverages (four to five percent range), bodily injury coverage (six to seven percent range) and PIP coverage (two to four percent range). We attributed these increases to miles driven, repair costs (parts and labor) and medical costs, as well as to weather conditions. Underwriting expenses in 2015 increased 5.8% to $3.6 billion. During 2015, advertising and employee-related costs grew at a slower rate than premiums. As a result, our expense ratio in 2015 declined 0.7 percentage points compared to 2014. General Re General Re conducts a reinsurance business offering property and casualty coverages to clients worldwide through General Reinsurance Corporation, Germany-based General Reinsurance AG, Faraday Holdings in London and other wholly-owned affiliates. We write property and casualty reinsurance primarily on a direct basis, but is also written through brokers and intermediaries. We write life and health reinsurance primarily on a direct basis through General Re Life Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We strive to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of our product lines. Our management does not evaluate underwriting performance based upon market share and our underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Re’s underwriting results are summarized in the following table (in millions). Premiums written Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 Property/casualty $ 2,560 $ 2,725 $ 3,257 $ 2,569 $ 2,805 $ 3,103 $ 117 $ 150 $ 204 Life/health 3,069 3,165 3,161 3,068 3,170 3,161 73 (18 ) 73 $ 5,629 $ 5,890 $ 6,418 $ 5,637 $ 5,975 $ 6,264 $ 190 $ 132 $ 277 34 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Property/casualty In 2016, property/casualty premiums written declined $165 million (6%) and premiums earned declined $236 million (8%) compared to 2015, primarily due to lower volume in direct and broker market business, and to a lesser degree, unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes. Insurance industry capacity remains high and price competition in most property/casualty reinsurance markets persists. We continue to decline business when we believe prices are inadequate. However, we remain prepared to write substantially more business when appropriate prices can be attained. Our property/casualty business produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $117 million in 2016 and $150 million in 2015. Results included pre-tax underwriting gains from property business of $211 million in 2016, a decline of $78 million compared to 2015. The decline was primarily due to lower gains from reductions of estimated losses on prior years’ property business. There were no significant catastrophe or large property losses in each of the past three years. Our casualty/workers’ compensation business produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $94 million in 2016 and $139 million in 2015. Underwriting results in each year included net losses on current year business and charges for recurring discount accretion on workers’ compensation liabilities and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance contracts, partially offset by gains from reductions of estimated losses on prior years’ business. Discount accretion and deferred charge amortization produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $89 million in 2016 and $94 million in 2015. Casualty losses tend to be long-tailed and the favorable loss experience is not a guarantee that the current ultimate liability estimates will develop favorably in the future. In 2015, property/casualty premiums written declined $532 million (16%), while premiums earned decreased $298 million (10%) compared to 2014. Adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums written and earned in 2015 declined 9% and 2% compared to 2014. Our premium volume declined in both the direct and broker markets worldwide. Our property/casualty business produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $150 million in 2015 and $204 million in 2014. In 2015, our property business generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $289 million compared to $445 million in 2014. The comparative decrease in underwriting gains reflected an increase in the current accident year loss ratio, primarily attributable to a relative increase in reported losses. Our casualty/workers’ compensation business produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $139 million in 2015 and $241 million in 2014. Underwriting results in each year included net losses on current year business, partly offset by gains from reductions of estimated losses on prior years’ business. The reductions of prior years’ losses were net of recurring charges for discount accretion on workers’ compensation liabilities and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance contracts of $94 million in 2015 and $97 million in 2014. Life/health Life/health premiums earned in 2016 decreased 3% compared to 2015. Adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums earned in 2016 were relatively unchanged from 2015, as growth in the United Kingdom and Asia markets was offset by a decline in Canada. Our life/health business produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $73 million in 2016 compared to losses of $18 million in 2015. In 2016, underwriting results reflected increased underwriting gains from our international life business, lower claim severity in North America, and lower losses from changes in actuarial assumptions related to long-term care business. Life/health premiums written and earned in 2015 were relatively unchanged from 2014. However, adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums earned in 2015 increased $266 million (8%) as compared to 2014. In 2015, life business increased across a number of non-U.S. markets, particularly in Canada and Asia. Our life/health business produced aggregate pre-tax underwriting losses in 2015 of $18 million compared to gains of $73 million in 2014. Our North American long-term care business generated increased underwriting losses of $77 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to increased reserves from estimated premium deficiencies. We also experienced higher frequency and severity of losses in North American individual life business in 2015, partially offset by increased underwriting gains from international life business. 35 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group BHRG underwrites excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages on property and casualty risks for insurers and reinsurers worldwide, including property catastrophe insurance and reinsurance. BHRG also writes retroactive reinsurance on property/casualty exposures as well as life reinsurance and periodic payment annuity business. A summary of BHRG’s underwriting results follows (in millions). Premiums written Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 Property/casualty $ 4,433 $ 4,702 $ 4,097 $ 4,649 $ 4,416 $ 4,064 $ 767 $ 944 $ 1,411 Retroactive reinsurance 1,254 5 3,371 1,254 5 3,371 (49 ) (469 ) (632 ) Life and annuity 2,601 2,786 2,681 2,601 2,786 2,681 104 (54 ) (173 ) $ 8,288 $ 7,493 $ 10,149 $ 8,504 $ 7,207 $ 10,116 $ 822 $ 421 $ 606 Property/casualty Premiums earned in 2016 increased $233 million (5.3%) reflecting an increase from the 10-year, 20% quota-share contract with Insurance Australia Group Ltd. (“IAG”), which became effective on July 1, 2015, partly offset by declines from property catastrophe and other quota-share business. The IAG quota-share contract represented 37% of our property/casualty earned premiums in 2016. Our premium volume is generally constrained for most property/casualty reinsurance coverages as rates, in our view, are generally inadequate. Consistent with General Re, we have the capacity and desire to write more business when appropriate pricing can be attained. Our property/casualty business generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $767 million in 2016 and $944 million in 2015. The decline in pre-tax underwriting gains in 2016 was primarily due to a comparative decline in gains from reductions of estimated prior years’ loss reserves. We experienced no significant catastrophe loss events during the last three years. Premiums written and earned in 2015 increased $605 million (15%) and $352 million (9%), respectively, compared to 2014. These increases were primarily attributable to the IAG quota-share contract, partially offset by lower property catastrophe, property quota-share and London facilities volume. The property/casualty business generated pre-tax underwriting gains in 2015 of $944 million compared to $1.4 billion in 2014. Underwriting results in 2015 included comparatively lower gains from property catastrophe reinsurance and comparatively lower gains from reductions of estimated prior years’ loss reserves. Retroactive reinsurance We periodically write retroactive reinsurance contracts, which provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Retroactive reinsurance premiums earned in 2016 primarily derived from three new contracts, including $670 million from a contract with Hartford Fire Insurance Company covering the adverse development of certain asbestos and pollution claims losses, subject to an aggregate limit of $1.5 billion. Premiums earned in 2014 included $3 billion from a contract with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (“LMIC”), which covers claim liabilities from specified asbestos and environmental exposures under policies incepting before 2005, and workers’ compensation occurrences arising before 2014. Pre-tax underwriting results from certain retroactive reinsurance contracts include gains/losses associated with the re-measurement of foreign currency denominated liabilities due to changes in exchange rates. Such gains were $392 million in 2016, $150 million in 2015 and $273 million in 2014 and primarily related to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Great Britain Pound (“GBP”) and the Euro. Before such gains, retroactive reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax losses of $441 million in 2016, $619 million in 2015 and $905 million in 2014, attributable to deferred charge amortization and changes in the timing and amount of ultimate losses. The underwriting results of retroactive reinsurance include the periodic amortization of deferred charge assets established in connection with these contracts. At the inception of a contract, we recognize deferred charge assets for the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate losses payable over the premiums earned. We subsequently amortize the deferred charges over the estimated claims payment period based on estimates of the timing and amount of future loss payments. Amortization charges and deferred charge adjustments resulting from changes to the estimated timing and amount of future loss payments are included in earnings. 36 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance (Continued) Changes in estimated ultimate liabilities for contracts written in prior years were relatively insignificant in 2016, whereas during each of the prior two years, we increased estimated ultimate liabilities approximately $550 million in 2015 and $825 million in 2014 for contracts written in prior years. We also reevaluated the timing of future payments of remaining liabilities, which produced changes to unamortized deferred charges. These increases in estimated ultimate liabilities, net of related deferred charge adjustments, produced incremental pre-tax underwriting losses of approximately $90 million in 2015 and $450 million in 2014. As discussed in Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, we entered into a retroactive reinsurance agreement with affiliates of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”) in January 2017. Our premiums with respect to this contract are about $10 billion and our net aggregate limit is $20 billion. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $24.7 billion at December 31, 2016 and $23.7 billion at December 31, 2015. Unamortized deferred charges related to such reinsurance contracts were approximately $8.0 billion at December 31, 2016 and $7.6 billion at December 31, 2015. We currently estimate pre-tax losses in 2017 from deferred charge amortization of approximately $950 million, including approximately $375 million related to the new AIG agreement. Life and annuity A summary BHRG’s life and annuity underwriting results follows (in millions). Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 Periodic payment annuity $ 1,082 $ 1,286 $ 1,105 $ (128 ) $ (202 ) $ (197 ) Life reinsurance 1,502 1,481 1,555 1 (45 ) (23 ) Variable annuity 17 19 21 231 193 47 $ 2,601 $ 2,786 $ 2,681 $ 104 $ (54 ) $ (173 ) Premiums earned in 2016 from periodic payment annuity contracts decreased $204 million (15.9%) compared to 2015. The decrease reflected the effect of a large reinsurance contract in 2015 that generated premiums of $425 million, which more than offset a comparative increase in direct business. There were no periodic payment annuity reinsurance contracts in 2016. Generally, we receive premiums under periodic payment annuity contracts in full at inception and we make annuity payments over time, often extending for decades. At inception, we discount annuity liabilities for time value and recognize no gains or losses in earnings. Pre-tax underwriting losses are recognized over the annuity payment period from the recurring accretion of discounted annuity liabilities. Periodic payment annuity contracts generated pre-tax underwriting losses of $128 million in 2016, $202 million in 2015 and $197 million in 2014. Liabilities under certain contracts of a U.S. subsidiary are denominated in foreign currencies, most significantly the GBP. Changes in the exchange rates produce changes in the values of related liabilities, which are reflected in underwriting results. Exchange rate changes resulted in pre-tax gains of $313 million in 2016, $103 million in 2015 and $102 million in 2014. Before foreign currency exchange rate changes, pre-tax underwriting losses from annuity contracts were $441 million in 2016, $305 million in 2015 and $299 million in 2014. The increase in underwriting losses in 2016 reflected increased liabilities from new business and the impact of lower interest rates, which increased expected future loss payments under reinsurance contracts. Discounted annuity liabilities were approximately $9.8 billion at December 31, 2016 and $8.7 billion at December 31, 2015. The weighted average interest rate of these contracts was approximately 4.1% as of December 31, 2016. 37 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Life and annuity (Continued) Life reinsurance premiums increased 1.4% in 2016 compared to 2015, which declined 4.8% compared to 2014. The life reinsurance business produced near break-even results in 2016 and a pre-tax loss of $45 million in 2015. Underwriting losses in 2015 included losses of $53 million incurred in connection with certain terminated business. Our variable annuity business primarily consists of reinsurance contracts that provide guarantees on closed blocks of variable annuity business written by other insurers. Our pre-tax underwriting gains in each period of the past three years reflected changes in liabilities for guaranteed benefits, which were affected by changes in securities markets and interest rates, as well as from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins included in our liability estimates. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance underwriting businesses that primarily provide a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers include the MedPro Group, National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”) and Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company, Applied Underwriters and Central States Indemnity Company. 2016 2015 2014 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 6,684 $ 5,906 $ 4,904 Premiums earned $ 6,257 100.0 $ 5,394 100.0 $ 4,377 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 3,864 61.8 3,070 56.9 2,608 59.6 Underwriting expenses 1,736 27.7 1,500 27.8 1,143 26.1 Total losses and expenses 5,600 89.5 4,570 84.7 3,751 85.7 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 657 $ 824 $ 626 BH Primary premiums written and earned in 2016 increased 13.2% and 16.0%, respectively, compared to 2015. The increases were primarily attributable to volume increases from BH Specialty, MedPro Group, BHHC and GUARD. Premiums written and earned in 2015 increased 20.4% and 23.2%, respectively, over the prior year. The increases were primarily attributable to volume increases from BH Specialty, NICO Primary, BHHC and GUARD. BH Primary’s combined loss ratios were 61.8% in 2016, 56.9% in 2015 and 59.6% in 2014. The comparative increase in the loss ratio in 2016 reflected comparative declines in favorable loss development of prior years’ loss events and higher loss ratios on current year business. While our claims development has been favorable in recent years, our primary insurers write considerable amounts of healthcare malpractice, general liability and workers’ compensation business, which can have extended claim-tails. It should not be assumed that the current claim experience or underwriting results will continue into the future. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income generated from investments held by our insurance operations follows (in millions). 2016 2015 2014 Interest income $ 930 $ 888 $ 1,009 Dividend income 3,552 3,662 3,348 Investment income before taxes and noncontrolling interests 4,482 4,550 4,357 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 846 825 815 Net investment income $ 3,636 $ 3,725 $ 3,542 38 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Pre-tax investment income declined $68 million (1.5%) in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting lower dividend income attributable to portfolio changes, partly offset by an increase in interest income. We continue to hold significant cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills earning very low yields, although such yields in 2016 were higher than in 2015. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to such balances. In December 2016, Dow exercised its option to convert our $3 billion Dow preferred stock investment into common stock. Prior to its conversion, we received dividends of $255 million per annum. Interest earned declined $121 million (12%) in 2015 versus 2014. The reduction reflected the maturities and dispositions of fixed maturity securities with higher interest rates. Dividend income increased $314 million (9%) in 2015 versus 2014. Dividend income in 2015 included income from our investment in Restaurant Brands International, Inc. 9% Preferred Stock ($3 billion stated value), which was acquired in December 2014. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $91 billion at December 31, 2016, $88 billion at December 31, 2015 and $84 billion at December 31, 2014. The cost of float was negative over the last three years as our insurance business generated pre-tax underwriting gains in each year.

BNSF operates approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states and also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF’s major business groups are classified by type of product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (in millions). 2016 2015 2014 Revenues $ 19,829 $ 21,967 $ 23,239 Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 4,769 5,043 5,023 Fuel 1,934 2,656 4,478 Purchased services 2,418 2,546 2,592 Depreciation and amortization 2,128 2,001 2,123 Equipment rents, materials and other 1,895 2,018 2,021 Total operating expenses 13,144 14,264 16,237 Interest expense 992 928 833 14,136 15,192 17,070 Pre-tax earnings 5,693 6,775 6,169 Income taxes 2,124 2,527 2,300 Net earnings $ 3,569 $ 4,248 $ 3,869 Consolidated revenues were approximately $19.8 billion in 2016, a decrease of $2.1 billion (9.7%) compared to 2015. Pre-tax earnings were $5.7 billion in 2016, a decrease of $1.1 billion (16.0%) compared to 2015. Our total volume was approximately 9.8 million cars/units in 2016 compared to approximately 10.3 million in 2015. In 2016, we experienced declining demand, especially in our coal and crude oil categories. Coal had the largest decline, driven by structural changes in that business as well as competition from low natural gas prices. While natural gas prices and the amount of electricity burn will affect the demand for coal in 2017, our long-term demand outlook for U.S. and global coal consumption is lower. Freight revenues reflected comparative declines in 2016 in average revenue per car/unit (5.2%) and volumes (5.0%). The decrease in average revenue per car/unit was primarily attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue driven by lower fuel prices and to business mix changes. The fuel price impact on fuel surcharges generally lags its impact on fuel costs. Freight revenues from consumer products were $6.5 billion in 2016, a decline of 0.9% from 2015. The revenue decline reflected lower average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by volume increases of 1%. Consumer products volumes increased primarily due to higher domestic intermodal volumes and the addition of a new automotive customer. Lower international intermodal volumes attributable to soft economic activity and excess retail inventories partially offset these increases. Freight revenues from industrial products were $4.8 billion in 2016, a decline of 14.2% compared with 2015. The decrease reflects lower volumes, primarily for petroleum products, reflecting pipeline displacement of U.S. crude rail traffic and lower U.S. oil production. In addition, there was lower demand for steel and taconite, partially offset by increased plastics products volume. We expect low oil production and pipeline displacement will continue to negatively impact the demand for crude oil shipments in 2017. Freight revenues from agricultural products remained relatively flat at $4.2 billion. Agricultural product volume increased by 6.3% in 2016, primarily due to higher corn, soybean and wheat exports, offsetting a decrease in average revenue per car/unit. Freight revenues from coal decreased 26.9% to $3.4 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting a 21.1% decline in volumes and lower average rate per car/unit. Demand for coal has declined due to reduced energy consumption, coal unit retirements, high coal stockpiles and low natural gas prices. 40 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Operating expenses were $13.1 billion in 2016, a decrease of $1.1 billion (7.9%) compared to 2015, and our ratio of operating expenses to revenues increased 1.4 percentage points to 66.3%. Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $274 million (5.4%) compared to 2015. The decline was primarily due to lower employment levels resulting from lower freight volumes and productivity improvements, partially offset by inflation. Fuel expenses declined $722 million (27.2%) compared to 2015, due to lower average fuel prices and lower volumes. Purchased services declined $128 million (5.0%) due to lower volumes and cost reductions. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $127 million (6.3%) compared to 2015 due to increased assets in service reflecting our ongoing capital additions and improvement programs. Equipment rents, materials and other expense declined $123 million (6.1%) compared to 2015, primarily due to lower freight volumes and productivity improvements. Interest expense was $992 million in 2016, an increase of $64 million (6.9%) compared to 2015. Interest expense in 2015 was $928 million, an increase of $95 million (11%) compared to 2014. BNSF funds its capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and new debt issuances. The comparative increases in each period resulted from higher average outstanding debt. Consolidated revenues were approximately $22.0 billion in 2015, a decrease of $1.3 billion (5%) compared to 2014. Pre-tax earnings were $6.8 billion in 2015, an increase of $606 million (10%) over 2014. Results in 2015 benefitted from significantly improved operating performance compared to substandard service during 2014. The operational improvements in 2015 reflected the capacity added in 2014 and 2015 through capital investments for line expansion, system improvement projects, other operational initiatives and more favorable winter weather conditions. Our total volume was approximately 10.3 million cars/units in 2015. During the second half of 2015 and particularly in the fourth quarter, we experienced declining demand, especially in coal and certain industrial products categories. The decrease in consolidated revenues in 2015 reflected a 6% decline in average revenue per car/unit and a 0.1% decrease in volume. The decrease in average revenue per car/unit was attributable to a 55% decline in fuel surcharges ($1.6 billion) versus 2014, primarily due to lower fuel prices. The impact of lower fuel surcharge revenues affected revenues of all product lines. Freight revenues from industrial products decreased 11% in 2015 compared to 2014 to $5.6 billion. The decrease reflected lower volumes for petroleum products, frac sand and steel products and lower average revenue per car/unit. Freight revenues from agricultural products increased 2% in 2015 to approximately $4.2 billion as compared to revenues in 2014. The increase in 2015 was attributable to higher domestic grain shipments and milo exports. Freight revenues from coal decreased 7% to $4.6 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. The revenue decline was primarily due to lower average rates per car. Coal volume increased 1% primarily due to higher demand in the early part of the year as customers restocked coal inventories. Freight revenues from consumer products were $6.6 billion in 2015, a decline of 6% from 2014. The revenue decline reflected lower average rates per car/unit, partially offset by volume increases of 1%. In the first quarter of 2015, we experienced a decline in international intermodal volume attributable to diversions of freight from U.S. West Coast ports to other import gateways as a result of the port productivity slow-down from port labor disruptions. Over the remainder of 2015, we experienced increased volume, as port productivity improvements allowed the backlog to clear, as well as from higher demand. Operating expenses were $14.3 billion in 2015, a decrease of $2 billion (12%) compared to 2014. The ratio of operating expenses to revenues declined 4.9 percentage points to 64.9% as compared to 2014. Compensation and benefits expenses were relatively flat versus 2014. In response to weakening customer demand in the latter half of 2015, employment levels were reduced. Fuel expenses declined $1.8 billion (41%) compared to 2014, reflecting significantly lower average fuel prices, improved efficiency and lower gross ton miles volume. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $122 million (6%) compared to 2014 as a result of lower capitalized software amortization expenses, partially offset by increased depreciation expense attributable to increased levels of railroad assets in service. Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) We hold a 90% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. Other energy businesses include AltaLink, L.P. (“AltaLink”), a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada and a diversified portfolio of independent power projects. In addition, BHE also operates the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. 41 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based, in large part, on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent these operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. Revenues and earnings of BHE are summarized below (in millions).

PacifiCorp’s revenues were $5.25 billion in 2016, slightly lower than 2015. Revenues reflected increased retail revenues and lower wholesale and other operating revenues. The increase in retail revenues was primarily due to higher retail rates as volumes were relatively unchanged. The declines in wholesale revenues were attributable to lower volumes and average prices. EBIT in 2016 increased $79 million (7.7%) from 2015, primarily due to increased gross margins (operating revenues less cost of sales), reflecting lower fuel prices and changes in fuel mix. Revenues declined $36 million (1%) in 2015 compared to 2014. Wholesale and other revenues declined $129 million, principally due to lower wholesale prices and volumes and lower renewable energy credit revenue, while retail revenues increased compared to 2014, reflecting higher average rates partially offset by slightly lower volumes. EBIT increased $16 million (2%) in 2015 compared to 2014. Gross margins increased $109 million versus 2014, as energy costs declined more than revenues. The increase in gross margins substantially offset an increase in depreciation and amortization expense ($35 million) due to increased plant-in-service, lower allowances for equity funds used during construction ($18 million) and the impact of the recognition in 2014 of expected insurance recoveries on fire losses. MidAmerican Energy Company MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. Revenues increased $114 million (4.5%) in 2016 compared to 2015. Revenues in 2016 included increased electric revenues ($148 million), which were somewhat offset by lower natural gas revenues ($24 million). The increase in electric revenues resulted primarily from a 3.8% increase in customer volumes and higher rates. Wholesale and other revenues increased primarily due to increased average wholesale prices and higher transmission revenue. The decline in natural gas revenues was primarily due to lower average per-unit costs of gas sold ($42 million), which is offset in cost of sales, partly offset by higher wholesale volumes. EBIT increased $100 million (34.2%) in 2016 from 2015. The increase in EBIT was primarily due to increased gross margins from electric revenues and lower operations and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization from additional assets placed in service, and higher interest expense. MEC’s revenues declined $346 million (12%) in 2015 from 2014. Regulated natural gas revenues declined $335 million, which was primarily attributable to lower average per-unit cost of gas sold, which is substantially offset in lower cost of sales. Regulated electric revenues increased slightly, due primarily to higher retail rates in Iowa and higher volumes, partially offset by lower average wholesale prices. The increases in regulated electric rates in Iowa are attributable to higher retail rates and changes in rate structure approved in August 2014, which results in a greater differential between higher rates from June to September and lower rates in the remaining months. 42 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) MidAmerican Energy Company (Continued) EBIT increased $22 million (8%) in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting an increase in gross margins ($107 million), partially offset by increases in depreciation expense from new wind generation and other plant-in-service ($56 million), interest expense ($17 million) and lower allowances for equity funds used during construction ($19 million). The increase in gross margins derived primarily from the regulated electric business, which benefitted from the aforementioned changes in Iowa rates and rate structure and lower fuel and purchased power costs. In addition, EBIT included a gain of $13 million in 2015 from the sale of a generating facility lease. NV Energy NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. Revenues were approximately $2.9 billion in 2016, a decrease of $457 million (13.5%) versus 2015. The decline was primarily attributable to lower electric retail rates resulting from lower energy costs. Electric retail volumes in 2016 were flat compared to 2015. EBIT fell $27 million (4.6%) compared to 2015. The decline in revenues was substantially offset by a decline in energy costs. Operating expenses increased $39 million (4%) and interest expense decreased $17 million (6.6%). The increase in operating expenses reflected higher depreciation and amortization and reductions in certain accrued liabilities in 2015. Revenues and EBIT were $3.4 billion and $586 million in 2015, representing increases of $103 million (3%) and $37 million (7%) over 2014. The increase in revenues was due primarily to higher retail electric revenues reflecting increased customers and higher volumes. The increase in EBIT was attributable to an increase in gross margins ($82 million) and lower interest expense ($22 million), partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization ($31 million) and higher other operating expenses, including increased energy efficiency costs. Northern Powergrid Revenues declined $144 million (12.6%) to $997 million in 2016, primarily due to the impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar ($127 million) and lower distribution revenues. EBIT declined $93 million (20.2%) to $367 million. The decline was due to lower distribution revenues and the stronger U.S. Dollar, as well as increases in depreciation expense from increased assets in service and higher asset impairment charges. Revenues declined $143 million (11%) in 2015 versus 2014, reflecting the adverse impact of the stronger U.S. Dollar ($90 million) and comparatively lower distribution revenues. The decline in distribution revenues reflected lower rates due mainly to the new price control period effective April 1, 2015. EBIT declined $67 million (13%) compared to 2014, reflecting the adverse effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar and lower distribution revenues partially offset by lower interest expense ($13 million). Natural Gas Pipelines Revenues declined $32 million (3.1%) in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to the impact of lower gas sales from balancing activities and lower transportation revenues from lower volumes and rates, in part due to comparatively milder temperatures in the first quarter of 2016. EBIT increased $12 million (3.0%) versus 2015, reflecting lower interest expense, resulting from lower average debt balances and lower operating expenses, partly offset by the lower transportation revenues. Revenues declined $75 million (7%) in 2015 versus 2014, which was primarily due to lower gas sales as a result of reduced system and operational balancing activities, partially offset by higher transportation revenues. EBIT increased $22 million (6%) as compared to 2014, as decreased costs of gas sold and lower operating expenses more than offset the decline in revenues. Other energy businesses Revenues declined $98 million (4.2%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The decline in comparative revenues was principally attributable to lower revenues from AltaLink and from our unregulated retail services business. AltaLink’s year-to-date revenue decline reflected the impact of a regulatory decision in the second quarter of 2016 that resulted in one-time net reductions in revenue, which more than offset increased revenues from additional assets placed in service. The regulatory decision changed the timing of when construction-in-progress expenditures included in the rate base are billable to customers and earned in revenues, but had no impact on net earnings, as one-time reductions in expenses offset the one-time revenue reduction. EBIT declined $17 million (4.3%) compared to 2015, primarily due to lower earnings from our renewable energy businesses, primarily due to higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in service. 43 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) Other energy businesses (Continued) Revenues of other energy businesses increased $739 million (46.7%) in 2015 over revenues in 2014, while EBIT increased $130 million (49%) versus 2014. Revenues and EBIT in 2015 reflect the acquisition of AltaLink on December 1, 2014. AltaLink’s revenues and EBIT in 2015 were $621 million and $170 million, respectively. The remaining increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in solar capacity placed in service. Excluding the acquisition of AltaLink, the impact of higher revenues in 2015 was more than offset by higher operating, depreciation and interest expenses. Real estate brokerage Revenues increased 11.0% to $2.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to increased closed brokerage transactions (primarily resulting from business acquisitions) and a 2% increase in average home sales prices, as well as higher mortgage revenues. EBIT increased $34 million (17.8%) in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the increases in mortgage revenues. Real estate brokerage revenues and EBIT increased 17% and 37%, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. The revenue increase reflected comparative increases in closed transactions and average home prices and the impact of business acquisitions. The increase in EBIT was primarily due to the increased revenues, net of commission expense, as well as a lower operating expense to revenue ratio as compared to 2014. Corporate interest and income taxes Corporate interest includes interest on unsecured debt issued by BHE and borrowings from certain Berkshire insurance subsidiaries in connection with BHE’s acquisitions of NV Energy and AltaLink. The decline in corporate interest in 2016 was primarily due to lower average borrowings from Berkshire insurance subsidiaries. In 2015, corporate interest expense increased over the prior year due to new borrowings in connection with the AltaLink acquisition. BHE’s consolidated effective income tax rates were approximately 14% in 2016, 16% in 2015, and 23% in 2014. BHE’s effective income tax rates regularly reflect significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation placed in service. In addition, pre-tax earnings of Northern Powergrid and AltaLink are taxed at lower statutory rates in the United Kingdom and Canada compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate. BHE’s effective rates in 2016 and 2015 also included reductions in deferred income tax liabilities resulting from enacted statutory income tax rate decreases in the United Kingdom and deferred state income tax benefits. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, retailing and service businesses follows (in millions). Revenues Earnings * 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 Manufacturing $ 46,506 $ 36,136 $ 36,773 $ 6,211 $ 4,893 $ 4,811 Service and retailing 73,553 71,689 60,916 2,251 2,222 1,981 $ 120,059 $ 107,825 $ 97,689 Pre-tax earnings 8,462 7,115 6,792 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 2,831 2,432 2,324 $ 5,631 $ 4,683 $ 4,468 * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which were primarily from the amortization of identified intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings above were $771 million in 2016, $476 million in 2015 and $496 million in 2014. These expenses are included in “other” in the summary of earnings on page 32 and in the “other” earnings section on page 51. 44 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of businesses that produce industrial, building and consumer products. Industrial products businesses include specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon and Scott Fetzer). Beginning on January 29, 2016, our industrial products group also includes Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), a leading manufacturer of complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets. Our building products businesses include flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore), and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). Our consumer products businesses include leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports), and beginning February 29, 2016, the Duracell Company (“Duracell”), a leading manufacturer of high performance alkaline batteries. This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (in millions). Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 Industrial products $ 24,702 $ 16,760 $ 17,622 $ 4,209 $ 2,994 $ 3,159 Building products 10,772 10,316 10,124 1,178 1,167 896 Consumer products 11,032 9,060 9,027 824 732 756 $ 46,506 $ 36,136 $ 36,773 $ 6,211 $ 4,893 $ 4,811 Aggregate revenues in 2016 were approximately $46.5 billion, an increase of approximately $10.4 billion (28.7%) over 2015. Pre-tax earnings were approximately $6.2 billion in 2016, an increase of $1.3 billion (26.9%) compared to 2015. Excluding PCC and Duracell, manufacturing revenues were flat and pre-tax earnings declined compared to 2015. Industrial products Industrial products revenues increased approximately $7.9 billion (47.4%) in 2016 versus 2015, primarily due to the inclusion of PCC, partially offset by revenue declines of $859 million (5.1%) across our other businesses. Sales volumes of our other businesses declined compared to 2015, reflecting sluggish demand for many product categories, particularly for products sold to businesses in the oil and gas and heavy equipment industries. In addition, lower average costs of oil-based raw materials and metals and increased competitive pressures continued to lower average selling prices. Pre-tax earnings increased $1.2 billion (40.6%) in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting the inclusion of PCC, partially offset by comparative earnings declines from our other businesses. Lubrizol’s earnings in 2016 included pre-tax losses of $365 million in 2016 related to the disposition in the fourth quarter of an underperforming business. Earnings from several of Marmon’s manufacturing businesses and Lubrizol’s continuing operations declined, while earnings from IMC increased slightly. Generally, our industrial products manufacturers experienced a combination of weaker customer demand, sales price and mix changes, and increased restructuring costs, which were partly offset by benefits from cost containment initiatives and lower average material prices. Revenues declined $862 million (5%) in 2015 versus 2014. The foreign currency translation impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar produced approximately $782 million of the comparative revenue decline. In addition, commodity cost deflation in petroleum and metals used in certain of our products resulted in lower average selling prices, in particular for specialty chemicals, metal cutting tools, copper wire and plumbing products. Certain of our businesses experienced slowing customer demand over the last half of 2015 as the decline in oil prices and competitive pressures resulted in significantly lower sales volumes to customers in or related to the oil and gas industry. These negative factors were partly offset by revenues from bolt-on acquisitions of Lubrizol. Pre-tax earnings declined $165 million (5%) in 2015 compared to 2014. The comparative declines in earnings reflected the adverse impact of the stronger U.S. Dollar, partially offset by earnings from bolt-on acquisitions, lower average commodity-based material costs, and actions taken in response to the slowing sales volumes previously referenced. Such actions address cost structures and exiting lower margin business. 45 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products Building products revenues increased $456 million (4.4%) in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting volume-driven revenue increases by MiTek, Johns Manville, Acme and Shaw, as well as revenues from bolt-on acquisitions by Shaw and MiTek. The revenue increase reflected increased unit sales across several product categories, partly offset by lower average sales prices and changes in product mix. Pre-tax earnings increased $11 million (0.9%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The favorable effects of increased sales volume and lower manufacturing costs in 2016 (attributable to deflation in certain commodity unit costs) were offset by increased charges for asset impairments, pension settlements and environmental claims. Revenues increased $192 million (2%) in 2015 compared to 2014. The revenue increase reflected sales volume increases at Shaw, Johns Manville and MiTek, as well as the impact of bolt-on business acquisitions, partially offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar ($165 million). Pre-tax earnings increased $271 million (30%) compared to 2014. The overall increase in earnings was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in revenues and lower average raw material and energy costs, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation and increased restructuring charges. Shaw, Johns Manville and Benjamin Moore generated most of the comparative increase in earnings. Consumer products Consumer products revenues were approximately $11.0 billion in 2016, an increase of approximately $2.0 billion (21.8%) compared to 2015. The increase reflected the inclusion of Duracell and a 12% increase in Forest River’s revenues, which was primarily attributable to increased unit sales. Apparel revenues in 2016 declined $81 million (1.9%) compared to 2015, reflecting lower footwear sales and the impact of a divestiture by Fruit of the Loom in 2015. Consumer products pre-tax earnings increased $92 million (12.6%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The earnings increase reflected increased earnings from Forest River and apparel and footwear businesses, partly offset by pre-tax losses of Duracell. From its acquisition date, Duracell incurred approximately $109 million in transition, business integration and restructuring costs. Forest River generated a pre-tax earnings increase of 28%, primarily due to increased sales volumes and higher gross margins. Earnings of our apparel businesses increased 22% in 2016, primarily attributable to lower restructuring costs and a loss in 2015 from the disposition of a Fruit of the Loom operation, partly offset by lower earnings from our footwear businesses. Revenues of our consumer products manufacturers were approximately $9.1 billion in 2015, relatively unchanged from 2014. Forest River’s revenues increased 6% compared to 2014, due to a 4% increase in unit sales and increased average prices. Apparel revenues in 2015 declined 4% compared to 2014. The decline in apparel revenues was attributable to lower volume and the negative impact of foreign currency translation resulting from a stronger U.S. Dollar. Pre-tax earnings declined $24 million (3%) in 2015 compared to 2014. The decline was primarily due to a pre-tax loss in 2015 from the disposition of an unprofitable Fruit of the Loom operation and lower earnings from our footwear businesses, partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River. Service and retailing Our service and retailing businesses are comprised of a large group of independently managed businesses engaged in a variety of activities. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of these operations follows (in millions). Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 Service $ 10,386 $ 10,201 $ 9,854 $ 1,161 $ 1,156 $ 1,202 Retailing 15,092 13,265 4,422 659 564 344 McLane Company 48,075 48,223 46,640 431 502 435 $ 73,553 $ 71,689 $ 60,916 $ 2,251 $ 2,222 $ 1,981 Service Our service businesses offer fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI) and franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen). Services also include the electronic distribution of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire), publication of newspapers and other publications (Buffalo News and the BH Media Group) and operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). We also offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). 46 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service (Continued) Service revenues increased 1.8% to approximately $10.4 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to revenue increases from TTI and Charter Brokerage partly offset by a revenue decrease from NetJets. TTI’s revenues increased 7.2%, primarily due to sales volume increases in Asia, Europe and through the Internet, while the increase from Charter Brokerage primarily derived from a commodity trading business launched in 2015. NetJets’ revenues decreased 2.0% reflecting lower aircraft sales. Pre-tax earnings were $1.2 billion in 2016, relatively unchanged versus 2015, reflecting increased earnings from NetJets and lower earnings from our newspaper operations. NetJets’ earnings increased 19%, primarily due to lower subcontracting expense and a decline in losses from aircraft impairments and dispositions, partly offset by increases in depreciation and restructuring charges and reduced aircraft sale margins. TTI’s earnings were relatively unchanged, as changes in geographic sales mix and price competition produced lower gross margin rates, substantially offsetting the aforementioned revenue increase. Revenues increased $347 million (3.5%) in 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase included a 5% increase in NetJets’ revenues and the impact of the acquisitions of Charter Brokerage and WPLG during 2014, partly offset by reduced revenues from our newspaper operations. The increase in NetJets’ revenues was attributable to a 50% increase in aircraft sales, partially offset by lower flight operations revenue. Pre-tax earnings declined $46 million in 2015 compared to 2014. Earnings benefitted from the WPLG and Charter Brokerage acquisitions, which were more than offset by lower earnings from NetJets. Earnings declined at NetJets as the impact of increased aircraft sales margins was more than offset by increased personnel, aircraft subcontracting and maintenance expenses. A portion of the increase in personnel costs pertained to lump-sum payments made in connection with a collective bargaining agreement reached with our pilots in the fourth quarter of 2015. Retailing Our retailing businesses include four distinct home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. Our retailers also include Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”), which we acquired in the first quarter of 2015. BHA currently includes 83 auto dealerships. BHA sells new and pre-owned automobiles, offering repair and other related services and products, and also includes two related insurance businesses, two auto auctions and a distributor of automotive fluid maintenance products. Our other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories acquired in the second quarter of 2015. Retailing revenues increased $1.8 billion (13.8%) in 2016 to $15.1 billion as compared to 2015. The increase in revenues reflected the impact of the BHA and Louis acquisitions during 2015, which accounted for approximately $1.6 billion of the comparative increase. Home furnishings revenues increased $227 million (7.8%), primarily due to new stores opened in 2015 by Nebraska Furniture Mart and Jordan’s, as well as modest organic growth. Pre-tax earnings increased $95 million (16.8%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase reflected the impact of the BHA and Louis acquisitions and increased earnings from most of our other retailers, which benefitted from a combination of revenue increases and cost savings initiatives. Revenues increased approximately $8.8 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase reflected the impact of the BHA and Louis acquisitions, which together contributed revenues of approximately $8.3 billion. Revenues of our home furnishings retailers increased $572 million (24%) over 2014, driven by Nebraska Furniture Mart, which opened a new store in March 2015 and from increases at R.C. Willey and Jordan’s. Pre-tax earnings increased $220 million (64%) compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the BHA and Louis acquisitions. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales volumes and very low profit margins and have several significant customers, including Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven and Yum! Brands. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. 47 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) McLane Company (Continued) Revenues were $48.1 billion in 2016, a decline of $148 million (0.3%) relative to 2015. In 2016, we experienced a comparative decline in grocery revenues, partly offset by an increase in foodservice revenues. Earnings were $431 million in 2016, a decrease of $71 million (14%) compared to 2015. The reduced earnings was primarily due to a reduction in McLane’s operating margin (ratio of earnings to revenues). The decline was primarily due to increased employee related costs. Competition in our grocery and foodservice businesses has been and will likely continue to be intense and our ability to control operating costs is a key factor in maintaining profitability. Additionally, earnings in 2015 included a gain of $19 million from the disposition of a subsidiary. Revenues increased $1.6 billion (3%) in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting revenue increases in the foodservice unit (6%), beverage unit (8%) and grocery unit (2%). Pre-tax earnings increased $67 million (15%) in 2015 versus 2014. Pre-tax earnings in 2015 included the aforementioned gain from the sale of a subsidiary and otherwise benefitted from lower fuel and trucking costs. Finance and Financial Products Our finance and financial products businesses include manufactured housing and finance (Clayton Homes), transportation equipment manufacturing and leasing businesses (UTLX and XTRA, and together, “transportation equipment leasing”), as well as other leasing and financing activities. A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows (in millions). Revenues Earnings 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 Manufactured housing and finance $ 4,230 $ 3,576 $ 3,310 $ 744 $ 706 $ 558 Transportation equipment leasing 2,650 2,540 2,427 959 909 827 Other 795 848 789 427 471 454 $ 7,675 $ 6,964 $ 6,526 Pre-tax earnings 2,130 2,086 1,839 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 703 708 596 $ 1,427 $ 1,378 $ 1,243 Manufactured housing and finance Clayton Homes’ revenues increased $654 million (18%) in 2016 compared to 2015, attributable to a 30% increase in revenues from home sales, primarily due to a 25% increase in units sold and product mix changes. Interest and other financial service income increased 1.8% from 2015. Pre-tax earnings increased $38 million (5.4%) compared to 2015. Earnings benefitted from increased home sales and improved manufacturing and retailing operating margins, partly offset by lower earnings from lending and financial services, which were negatively impacted by increased insurance losses. A significant portion of Clayton’s earnings are generated from lending activities, which in recent years benefitted from relatively low delinquency rates and loan losses and from declining borrowing costs attributable to lower average interest rates. As of December 31, 2016, Clayton Homes’ installment loan portfolio was approximately $13.3 billion and approximately 94% of the loan balances were current in terms of payment status. Revenues and pre-tax earnings increased $266 million (8%) and $148 million (27%) in 2015, respectively, as compared to 2014. The revenue increase was primarily due to a 9% increase in home unit sales. The increase in earnings was primarily due to lower interest expense, improved manufacturing results, relatively low delinquency rates and lower loss rates on loan foreclosures. The decline in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest rates and to a lesser extent lower average balances. Transportation equipment leasing Transportation equipment leasing revenues increased $110 million (4.3%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase derived primarily from the acquisition of General Electric Company’s (“GE”) tank car fleet and its railcar repair services business in 2015 and increased rates and tank car additions. These increases were partly offset by lower utilization rates, unfavorable foreign currency effects, lower crane lease demand in North America and reduced volume related to oil and gas markets. 48 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Finance and Financial Products (Continued) Transportation equipment leasing (Continued) Pre-tax earnings increased $50 million (5.5%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to revenue growth and lower depreciation rates on certain tank car assets, partially offset by higher repair costs and interest expense on new borrowings from a Berkshire financing subsidiary. Significant portions of transportation leasing expenses, such as depreciation, do not vary proportionately to revenue changes and therefore changes in revenues can disproportionately impact earnings. Revenues increased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase reflected increased railcar lease rates, a larger fleet of railcars, higher volumes in our Australian crane business, increased over-the-road trailers on lease and gains on dispositions of trailers. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower volumes in our North American crane leasing business due to declines in oil drilling activity. As previously mentioned, we acquired GE’s tank car fleet on September 30, 2015, which included approximately 25,000 tank cars. We also acquired several railcar repair and maintenance facilities at the end of 2015. Pre-tax earnings increased $82 million (10%) in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the positive impact of the revenue growth discussed above, which more than offset the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and higher railcar repair and warranty costs and depreciation attributable to a larger fleet size. Other Other finance activities include CORT furniture leasing, our share of the earnings of a commercial mortgage servicing business (“Berkadia”) in which we own a 50% interest, and interest and dividends from a portfolio of investments. Other earnings decreased $44 million in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting lower earnings from investment securities, partly offset by increased earnings from CORT and Berkadia. Other earnings also includes income from interest rate spreads charged on borrowings by a Berkshire financing subsidiary that are used to finance Clayton Homes’ installment loans and beginning in 2016, UTLX’s fleet of rail/tank cars held for lease. Offsetting expenses ($74 million in 2016, $62 million in 2015 and $68 million in 2014) were included in Clayton Homes’ and UTLX’s results. Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows (in millions). 2016 2015 2014 Investment gains/losses $ 7,635 $ 9,399 $ 4,272 Other-than-temporary impairments (82 ) (26 ) (697 ) Derivative gains/losses 751 974 506 Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 8,304 10,347 4,081 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,807 3,622 760 Net gains/losses $ 6,497 $ 6,725 $ 3,321 Investment gains/losses Investment gains/losses arise primarily from the sale, redemption or exchange of investments. The timing of gains or losses can have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses included in earnings usually have minimal impact on the periodic changes in our consolidated shareholders’ equity since most of our investments are recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical or predictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will have on our reported earnings. Although we do not consider investment gains and losses as necessarily meaningful or useful in evaluating our periodic results, we are providing information to explain the nature of such gains and losses when reflected in our earnings. 49 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) Investment gains/losses (Continued) Pre-tax investment gains were $7.6 billion in 2016 and included gains of $2.4 billion from the sale to Mars Inc. of our Wrigley preferred stock investment, $610 million from the Kraft Heinz Preferred Stock redemption, $1.2 billion from the Dow Preferred Stock conversion into common stock, and $1.1 billion from the exchange of shares of P&G common stock for 100% of the common stock of Duracell. Income tax expense allocated to investment gains included a benefit from the reduction of certain deferred income tax liabilities in connection with the exchange of P&G common stock for Duracell. Pre-tax investment gains included non-cash holding gains related to our investment in Kraft Heinz of $6.8 billion in 2015. In connection with its acquisition of Kraft Foods on July 2, 2015, Kraft Heinz issued new shares of its common stock in exchange for the outstanding shares of Kraft Foods common stock, thus reducing Berkshire’s ownership interest in Kraft Heinz by approximately 50%. Under the equity method of accounting, such transactions are treated by the investor as if it sold a portion of its interests. Pre-tax investment gains were $4.3 billion in 2014, which included gains of approximately $2.1 billion realized in connection with the exchanges of common stock of Phillips 66 and Graham Holdings Company for 100% of the common stock of a specified subsidiary of each of those companies. Each exchange transaction in 2016 and 2014 was structured as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, no income taxes are payable on the excess of the fair value of the businesses received over the tax-basis of the common stock exchanged. Other-than-temporary impairments (“OTTI”) OTTI charges in 2016 and 2015 were not significant and in 2014 were $697 million, predominantly relating to our investment in equity securities of Tesco PLC. Although we have periodically recorded OTTI charges in earnings in past years, we continue to hold some of those securities. If the market values of those investments increase following the date we recorded OTTI charges, the increases are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and not in earnings. When recorded, OTTI charges have no impact whatsoever on the asset values otherwise recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets or on our consolidated shareholders’ equity. In addition, the recognition of such losses in earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income does not necessarily indicate that sales are planned and sales ultimately may not occur for a number of years. Furthermore, the recognition of OTTI charges does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is permanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost. Derivative gains/losses Derivative gains/losses primarily represented the changes in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contract liabilities. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying credit and equity markets and the changes in the inputs used to measure such liabilities. Changes in the values of our equity index put option contract liabilities produced pre-tax gains of $662 million in 2016, which were primarily due to increases in the index values, favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes and shorter remaining contract durations, partly offset by lower interest rates. Our equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax gains of approximately $1.0 billion in 2015, which were primarily attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar and shorter remaining durations. These contracts produced pre-tax gains of $108 million in 2014. Such gains reflected the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and generally higher index values, partially offset by the effect of lower interest rate assumptions. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate intrinsic value of our equity put option contracts was approximately $1.0 billion and our recorded liability was approximately $2.9 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates (beginning in 2018), and will be based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. In July 2016, our remaining credit default contract was terminated by mutual agreement with the counterparty and we paid the counterparty $195 million. This contract produced pre-tax earnings of $89 million in 2016, pre-tax losses of $34 million in 2015 and pre-tax earnings of $397 million in 2014. We have no further exposure to losses under credit default contracts. 50 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other A summary of after-tax other earnings (losses) which include corporate income (including income from our investments in Kraft Heinz), expenses and income taxes not allocated to operating businesses is summarized below (in millions). 2016 2015 2014 Kraft Heinz earnings $ 706 $ 841 $ 653 Acquisition accounting expenses (846 ) (515 ) (531 ) Corporate interest expense (97 ) (191 ) (153 ) Other (106 ) (105 ) (114 ) Net earnings (losses) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ (343 ) $ 30 $ (145 ) The reduced earnings in 2016 from our investments in Kraft Heinz were due to lower dividends from our Preferred Stock investment, which was redeemed in June 2016, somewhat offset by increased equity method earnings from our common stock investment. Other earnings also include charges from the application of the acquisition method in connection with Berkshire’s business acquisitions. Such charges were primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions, which we view as corporate expenses. Corporate interest expense includes after-tax foreign exchange gains of $159 million in 2016 and losses of $45 million in 2015 with respect to Euro denominated debt issued by Berkshire in March 2015 (€3.0 billion par) and March 2016 (€2.75 billion par). Excluding foreign currency effects, after-tax corporate interest expense was $256 million in 2016 and $146 million in 2015. The increase in 2016 was attributable to increased average outstanding debt. Financial Condition Our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2016 was $283.0 billion, an increase of $27.5 billion since December 31, 2015. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in 2016 were $24.1 billion. At December 31, 2016, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $70.9 billion, and investments (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) of $158.3 billion. In January 2016, we used cash of approximately $32.1 billion to fund the acquisition of PCC, which we funded through a combination of cash on hand and $10 billion borrowed under a 364-day revolving credit agreement. We repaid these borrowings following our issuance in March 2016, of €2.75 billion and $5.5 billion of senior unsecured notes. In August 2016, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes to replace $750 million of maturing notes. In January 2017, Berkshire issued new senior notes aggregating €1.1 billion and repaid $1.1 billion of maturing senior notes. There are no other parent company term debt maturities in 2017. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. In 2016, capital expenditures included $5.1 billion by BHE and $3.8 billion by BNSF. Aggregate capital expenditures of these businesses are forecasted to be $8.6 billion in 2017. We expect future capital expenditures will be funded by cash flows from operations and debt issuances. BNSF’s outstanding debt was approximately $22.0 billion as of December 31, 2016, an increase of $307 million from December 31, 2015. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries, excluding its borrowings from Berkshire insurance subsidiaries, were approximately $37.0 billion as of December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $1.0 billion from December 31, 2015. BNSF and BHE debt maturities in 2017 will be $3.6 billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF or BHE or any of their subsidiaries. Finance and financial products assets were approximately $41.7 billion as of December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $2.7 billion since December 31, 2015. Finance assets consist primarily of loans and finance receivables, various types of property held for lease, and cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills and other investments. In September 2016, a Berkshire finance subsidiary received approximately $4.6 billion from the sale of its Wrigley preferred stock investment. 51 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) Finance and financial products liabilities were approximately $19.7 billion as of December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $2.5 billion compared to December 31, 2015. The increase was attributable to $3.5 billion of debt issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”) in March, partly offset by lower derivative contract liabilities. The debt proceeds were used to fund loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and to fund a portion of existing assets held for lease by our UTLX railcar leasing business. In January 2017, BHFC issued new senior notes aggregating $1.3 billion due in 2019 and 2020 and repaid $1.05 billion of maturing notes. Over the remainder of 2017, an additional $1.75 billion of BHFC senior notes will mature. While we currently intend to have BHFC issue additional notes in 2017 to replace the maturing debt, the amount to be issued will be based on prevailing market conditions. Berkshire’s Board of Directors has authorized Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B common shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares at management’s discretion and there is no obligation to repurchase any shares. We expect the program to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase shares if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. There were no share repurchases under the program in 2016. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as minimum rentals under operating leases and certain purchase obligations, and are not currently reflected in the financial statements, but will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. The timing and/or amount of the payments under certain contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table that follows. Most significantly, the timing and amount of future payments arising under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of claim settlement activities or events. In addition, obligations arising under life, annuity and health insurance benefits are contingent on future premiums, allowances, mortality, morbidity, expenses and policy lapse rates, as applicable. These amounts are included in the following table based on the liability estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016. Although certain insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and life, annuity and health benefits are recoverable under reinsurance contracts, those receivables recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are not reflected in the table. A summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 follows (in millions).

(3) Amounts represent estimated undiscounted benefits, net of estimated future premiums, as applicable. 52 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Property and casualty losses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. Except for certain workers’ compensation reinsurance claims, we record all liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (referred to in this section as “gross unpaid losses”) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing liabilities and all techniques require significant judgments and assumptions. We believe the processes and techniques utilized best suit the underlying claims and available data. As of any balance sheet date, recorded liabilities include provisions for reported claims, as well as claims not yet reported and the development of reported claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contributes to extending claim-tails. Our liabilities as of December 31, 2016 were $76.9 billion, of which 85% related to GEICO, General Re and BHRG. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques of GEICO, General Re and BHRG follows. GEICO GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December 31, 2016, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses were $15.5 billion and unpaid losses net of reinsurance recoverable were $14.4 billion. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies. Liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2016, case development liabilities averaged approximately 25% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. For significant coverages, we test the adequacy of the aggregate liabilities for unpaid losses using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability estimates recorded at the end of 2015 developed downward by $61 million when reevaluated through December 31, 2016, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2016. We modified the assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2016 as appropriate to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated. 53 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) With respect to liabilities for BI claims, our most significant claim category, we believe it is reasonably possible that average severities will change by at least one percentage point from the severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2016. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $240 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. General Re and BHRG Liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses of General Re and BHRG derive primarily from reinsurance contracts. In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk), per occurrence excess or retroactive reinsurance contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract if reinsurer personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. However, loss information is often less detailed with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts. Additionally, loss information we receive through periodic reports is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers. Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. Periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies. In the U.S., such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. Outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. In some instances, reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks thereby creating multiple contractual intermediaries between us and the primary insured potentially compounding the claim reporting delays. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms and the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance contract and for other reasons. The premium and loss data we receive is through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. When received, we review the information for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s books and records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration, litigation or alternative dispute resolution processes. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. General Re Information concerning General Re’s gross and net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2016 follows (in millions). Type Line of business Reported case liabilities $ 6,536 Liability and workers’ compensation (1) $ 11,408 IBNR liabilities 6,884 Property 2,012 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 13,420 Total $ 13,420 Reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges (693 ) Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 12,727 (1) Net of discounts of approximately $1.4 billion. 54 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) For General Re, the critical processes involved in estimating unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include the establishment of case liability estimates, the determination of expected loss ratios, which drive IBNR liability estimates, and the comparison of reported loss trends to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded liabilities are subject to “tail risk” where reported losses are beyond the expected loss emergence period. Our process for estimating unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses begins with case loss estimates made by the ceding company. Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, we independently evaluate the case losses reported and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. As of December 31, 2016, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $2.2 billion, which were concentrated in the workers’ compensation line. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates. In estimating IBNR liabilities, we consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. In this process, we classify all loss and premium data into segments (“cells”) based primarily on product type (e.g., treaty, facultative and program), line of business (e.g., auto liability, property and workers’ compensation) and geographic jurisdiction. For each cell, we aggregate premiums and losses by accident year, policy year or underwriting year and analyze the data over time. There are several hundred cells. We use loss triangles to determine the expected development of reported claims for most coverages, which, together with the expected loss ratios, are used to calculate IBNR liability estimates. We select expected loss ratios by cell and by year based upon indicated ultimate loss ratios and forecasted losses obtained from pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are determined from the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premiums. Factors affecting our loss development triangles include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends, and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected loss emergence patterns. Once the IBNR liabilities are determined, we estimate the expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year, based on the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. We allocate the expected losses into interim estimates, which we compare to actual reported losses. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR liabilities and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR liability assumptions during the course of the year. During 2016, we reduced net losses for prior years’ occurrences by $280 million in the aggregate. This reduction produced a corresponding increase in pre-tax earnings. Reported claims for prior years’ property loss events were less than expected and we reduced our estimated ultimate liabilities by $157 million. However, property losses incurred during any given period may be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophe and large individual property loss events. In 2016, reported nominal losses for prior years’ workers’ compensation were less than expected, which after reevaluating expected remaining IBNR estimates, resulted in a reduction of nominal liabilities by $165 million. However, we discount workers’ compensation liabilities and after adjusting for changes in discounts, workers’ compensation losses for prior years’ occurrences had a minimal impact on pre-tax earnings. An increase of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in discounted workers’ compensation IBNR liabilities of approximately $889 million, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. Other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) were less than expected in 2016, resulting in a $205 million increase in pre-tax earnings. However, casualty losses tend to be long-tailed and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given period will continue in the future. For our significant casualty and general liability cells, we estimate that an increase of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and a five percent increase in expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million. While we believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates, more likely outcomes are less than $900 million given the diversification in worldwide business. 55 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, “mass tort”) liability estimates. General Re’s net liability for such losses at December 31, 2016, was approximately $1.2 billion, which included an increase in estimated ultimate losses of $98 million during 2016, which produced a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings. Mass tort loss estimations are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment, and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider “survival ratios”, which is the average net claim payments in recent years in relation to net unpaid losses, as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. General Re’s survival ratio was approximately 15 years as of December 31, 2016. BHRG A summary of BHRG’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2016 follows (in millions). Property Casualty Total Reported case liabilities $ 1,556 $ 2,399 $ 3,955 IBNR liabilities 2,904 4,831 7,735 Retroactive reinsurance liabilities — 24,675 24,675 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 4,460 $ 31,905 36,365 Deferred charges and reinsurance recoverable (8,509 ) Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 27,856 We use a variety of actuarial methodologies to establish unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. Certain methodologies, such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, are utilized, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate. A large percentage of BHRG’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive from retroactive reinsurance contracts, which relate to loss events occurring before the contract inception date. Gross liabilities with respect to such contracts were approximately $24.7 billion at December 31, 2016, and were predominately for casualty and liability coverages. We expect the claim-tail related to certain of these contracts to be very long. We establish aggregate liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing retroactive reinsurance liabilities, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses, and we re-estimate expected ultimate losses when significant events are reported or revealed. Certain of our contracts include significant exposures to asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. We estimate that our liabilities for such claims were approximately $13.7 billion at December 31, 2016. We do not receive consistently reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims data from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect these claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities. Changes in ultimate estimated liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts were relatively insignificant in 2016, as were changes in the estimated timing and amount of remaining unpaid losses. In 2016, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of approximately $1.1 billion with respect to these contracts. 56 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG (Continued) We currently believe that maximum losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $40 billion due to the aggregate contract limits that are applicable to most of these contracts. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15% of our year-end estimate. We also record deferred charges with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums. Unamortized deferred charges were approximately $8.0 billion at December 31, 2016, which will be amortized and charged to pre-tax earnings in the future based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2016, and the new AIG contract we currently estimate that amortization expense in 2017 will approximate $950 million. Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities related to property and casualty contracts, other than retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $11.7 billion as of December 31, 2016 and consisted primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. These coverages included catastrophe and aviation contracts that tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses, although such liabilities have diminished in recent years due to declines in business written. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. We generally establish liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustments expenses for these contracts based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on a portfolio basis, supplemented by management’s estimates of the impact of major catastrophe events as they become known. In 2016, we decreased estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ occurrences by approximately $585 million, which primarily derived from lower than expected losses reported by ceding companies. The decrease produced a corresponding increase in pre-tax earnings. Derivative contract liabilities We measure derivative contract liabilities at fair value. Our most significant derivative contract exposures relate to equity index put option contracts written between 2004 and 2008. We believe that the fair values produced for long-duration options are inherently subjective. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model, as transaction values may also reflect perceptions of individual buyers and sellers as well as other changes in market conditions. We determine the fair value of equity index put option contracts using a Black-Scholes based option valuation model. Inputs to the model include the current index value, strike price, interest rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted average interest and dividend rates used as of December 31, 2016 were 1.2% and 3.3%, respectively. The interest rates were approximately 57 basis points (on a weighted average basis) over benchmark interest rates at the end of 2016 and represented our estimate of our nonperformance risk. We believe that the most significant economic risks under these contracts relate to changes in the index value component and, to a lesser degree, the foreign currency component. The Black-Scholes based model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. Our contracts have an average remaining maturity of about four years. The weighted average volatility used as of December 31, 2016 was approximately 20.2%. We determine the weighted average volatilities based on the volatility input for each contract weighted by the contract’s notional value. The volatility input for each contract reflects our expectation of future price volatility. The potential impact from changes in our volatility assumptions are as follows. (Dollars in millions). Fair value at December 31, 2016 $2,890 Hypothetical change in volatility Hypothetical fair value Increase 2 percentage points $ 3,098 Increase 4 percentage points 3,319 Decrease 2 percentage points 2,695 Decrease 4 percentage points 2,516 57 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $79.5 billion. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2016. Our review includes determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then, as required by GAAP, we estimate the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied goodwill value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Equity Price Risk Historically, equity securities have represented a significant portion of our investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management and at sensible prices, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2016, approximately 60% of the total fair value of equity securities and other investments was concentrated in five issuers. We often hold our equity investments for long periods and short-term price volatility has and will occur. We are not necessarily disturbed by market price declines provided the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. We strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, fair values of these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract. 58 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Equity Price Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes our equity securities and other investments and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. We also show the effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical changes does not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

Interest Rate Risk We regularly invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced relative to the perceived credit risk. Our management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We strive to maintain high credit ratings so as to minimize the cost of our debt. We rarely utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate instruments are usually more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate instruments. 59 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Interest Rate Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that there are no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available to the issuer. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Foreign Currency Risk Certain of our subsidiaries operate in foreign jurisdictions and we transact business in foreign currencies. In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, such as The Coca-Cola Company, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and do not use derivative contracts to hedge or manage foreign currency price changes in any meaningful way. Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and services subsidiaries. This translation related impact may be offset by gains or losses related to net liabilities of Berkshire and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of such liabilities due to changes in exchange rates. 60 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Commodity Price Risk Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risks at BHE. BHE’s exposures to commodities include variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity purchased and sold and natural gas supply for customers. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage and transmission and transportation constraints. To mitigate a portion of the price volatility, BHE uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recoverable from customers in regulated rates. Financial results would be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are greater than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. The table that follows summarizes commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of BHE as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of each date. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Dollars are in millions.

Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. 61 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 63.

1067983,BRK-B,BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC,2018,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (in millions). 2017 2016 2015 Insurance – underwriting $ (2,219 ) $ 1,370 $ 1,162 Insurance – investment income 3,917 3,636 3,725 Railroad 3,959 3,569 4,248 Utilities and energy 2,083 2,287 2,132 Manufacturing, service and retailing 6,208 5,631 4,683 Finance and financial products 1,335 1,427 1,378 Investment and derivative gains/losses 1,377 6,497 6,725 Other (826 ) (343 ) 30 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 29,106 — — Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 44,940 $ 24,074 $ 24,083 Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance practices. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Our net earnings in 2017 included approximately $29.1 billion attributable to a one-time net benefit from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) on December 22, 2017. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This benefit included approximately $29.6 billion related to a one-time non-cash reduction of our net deferred income tax liabilities that arose from the reduction in the statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as a net benefit of approximately $900 million primarily from our earnings from Kraft Heinz, partly offset by a one-time income tax expense of approximately $1.4 billion payable over eight years on the deemed repatriation of certain accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Due to their significance, we presented these one-time effects as a distinct item in the preceding table. Accordingly, the after-tax figures presented in the discussion of our various operating businesses and other activities in this section exclude the one-time effects of the TCJA. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax losses from underwriting of $2.2 billion in 2017 compared to after-tax gains of $1.4 billion in 2016 and $1.2 billion in 2015. Underwriting results for 2017 included estimated pre-tax losses of approximately $3.0 billion ($1.95 billion after-tax), primarily attributable to three major hurricanes in the U.S. and Puerto Rico and wildfires in California. Underwriting results in each year also included after-tax foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses from the revaluation of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities. In 2017, such after-tax losses were $295 million compared to after-tax gains of $458 million in 2016 and $164 million in 2015. After-tax earnings of our railroad business in 2017 were $4.0 billion, an increase of 10.9% compared to 2016, reflecting increased unit volume. Our railroad business generated lower net earnings in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a 5.0% decline in unit volume. After-tax earnings of our utility and energy business in 2017 declined $204 million compared to 2016. Earnings in 2017 were negatively affected by losses from the prepayment of certain long-term debt. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy businesses increased in 2016 compared to 2015, attributable to increased pre-tax earnings and a lower effective income tax rate. After-tax earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2017 were $6.2 billion, an increase of 10.2% compared to 2016. Earnings in 2017 reflected comparatively higher earnings from several of our larger operations and the impact of businesses acquired in 2016 and 2017. After-tax earnings in 2016 of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased compared to 2015, primarily due to earnings from Precision Castparts, which was acquired on January 29, 2016, partly offset by comparatively lower overall earnings from the other businesses within this group. K-32 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Results of Operations (Continued) After-tax investment and derivative gains were approximately $1.4 billion in 2017, $6.5 billion in 2016 and $6.7 billion in 2015. The gains in 2016 included approximately $2.7 billion from the redemptions of our Wrigley and Kraft Heinz preferred stock investments, sales of Dow Chemical common stock that we received upon conversion of our Dow Chemical preferred stock investment and a non-cash gain of approximately $1.9 billion related to the exchange of Procter & Gamble (“P&G”) common stock for 100% of the common stock of Duracell. Gains in 2015 included non-cash holding gains of approximately $4.4 billion in connection with our investment in Kraft Heinz common stock. After-tax unrealized gains in 2017 related to our investments in equity securities included in other comprehensive income were approximately $19 billion. Beginning in 2018, unrealized gains and losses on equity securities will be included in net earnings due to a new accounting standard. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our periodic economic performance. Investment and derivative gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our earnings. Other earnings in 2017 and 2016 included after-tax foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses related to parent company Euro-denominated debt. After-tax foreign exchange losses on our Euro-denominated debt were $655 million in 2017 compared to after-tax gains of $159 million in 2016. In addition, other earnings includes earnings from our investment in Kraft Heinz. Insurance—Underwriting We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as a component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating, based on our long-held philosophy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods. Accordingly, we believe that such gains and losses are not predictable or necessarily meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance operations. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider pre-tax catastrophe losses in excess of $100 million from a current year event as significant, and we had six such events in 2017. There were no significant events in either 2016 or 2015. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts as of December 31, 2017 were approximately $104 billion. These estimates will be revised upward or downward in future periods, which could produce significant decreases or increases to pre-tax earnings. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rates can be volatile and the resulting impact on our underwriting earnings can be relatively significant. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (in millions). 2017 2016 2015 Underwriting gain (loss): GEICO $ (310 ) $ 462 $ 460 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (3,648 ) 1,012 553 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 719 657 824 Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) (3,239 ) 2,131 1,837 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (1,020 ) 761 675 Net underwriting gain (loss) $ (2,219 ) $ 1,370 $ 1,162 K-33 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2017 2016 2015 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 30,547 $ 26,309 $ 23,378 Premiums earned $ 29,441 100.0 $ 25,483 100.0 $ 22,718 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 25,497 86.6 21,044 82.6 18,647 82.1 Underwriting expenses 4,254 14.5 3,977 15.6 3,611 15.9 Total losses and expenses 29,751 101.1 25,021 98.2 22,258 98.0 Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) $ (310 ) $ 462 $ 460 Premiums written in 2017 were $30.5 billion, an increase of 16.1% compared to 2016. Premiums earned in 2017 were $29.4 billion, exceeding 2016 by approximately $4.0 billion (15.5%). During 2017, our voluntary auto policies-in-force grew approximately 8.6% and premiums per auto policy increased 6.9%. The increase in average premiums per policy was attributable to rate increases, coverage changes and changes in state and risk mix. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2017 increased 10.5% compared to 2016. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 1,276,000 during 2017. We incurred pre-tax underwriting losses in 2017, which included approximately $450 million from hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Our underwriting results in 2017 were also affected by increased average claims severities. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2017 were $25.5 billion, an increase of approximately $4.5 billion (21.2%) compared to 2016. Our loss ratio (the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to earned premiums) in 2017 increased 4.0 percentage points compared to 2016. Average claims severities were higher in 2017 for property damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range) and bodily injury coverage (five to seven percent range). Claims frequencies in 2017 were relatively unchanged compared to 2016 for bodily injury coverage, decreased about one percent for property damage and collision coverages and decreased about two to three percent for personal injury protection coverage. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2017 also included pre-tax losses of $517 million from the re-estimation of liabilities for prior years’ claims compared to pre-tax gains of $61 million in 2016 and $150 million in 2015. Underwriting expenses increased $277 million (7.0%) compared to 2016. Our expense ratios (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in 2017 declined 1.1 percentage points compared to 2016. The largest components of underwriting expenses are employee-related (salaries and benefits) and advertising, which increased at lower rates than premiums earned. Premiums written in 2016 increased 12.5% to $26.3 billion and premiums earned increased approximately $2.8 billion (12.2%) to $25.5 billion, compared to 2015. These increases reflected voluntary auto policies-in-force growth of 7% and increased average premiums per auto policy. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2016 increased 10.9% compared to the prior year. Voluntary auto new business growth accelerated over the last half of 2016 and, for the year, voluntary auto policies-in-force increased 974,000. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2016 increased $2.4 billion (12.9%) to $21.0 billion and our loss ratio in 2016 increased 0.5 percentage points compared to 2015. In 2016, we experienced increases in storm losses (primarily from hail and flooding) and claims severity, partly offset by the effects of premium rate increases. Claims frequencies in 2016 were relatively unchanged from 2015 for property damage, collision, bodily injury and personal injury protection coverages. Average claims severities were higher in 2016 for bodily injury, physical damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range). Underwriting expenses in 2016 were $4.0 billion, an increase of $366 million (10.1%) over 2015. The increase in underwriting expenses in 2016 reflected the increase in policies-in-force. K-34 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several legal entities, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO Group”), Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN Group”), and General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and General Re Life Corporation (collectively, “General Re Group”). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, the BHLN Group writes periodic payment annuity contracts. With the exception of our retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses, we strive to generate pre-tax underwriting profits in all product lines. Time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for our retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. Premiums received at inception under these contracts are often large, which are then available for investment. A summary of the premiums and pre-tax underwriting results of our reinsurers follows (in millions).

Roughly 40% of NICO Group’s premiums written and earned in 2017 and 2016 derived from a 10-year, 20% quota-share contract with Insurance Australia Group Ltd. (“IAG”) that incepted in July 2015. General Re Group’s premiums earned were $3.1 billion in 2017, an increase of $532 million (21%) compared to 2016. The increase reflected higher written premiums in both direct and broker markets, derived primarily from new business and increased participations for renewal business. Industry capacity dedicated to property and casualty markets remains high and price competition in most reinsurance markets persists. We continue to decline business when we believe prices are inadequate. On a combined basis, our property/casualty reinsurance business sustained pre-tax underwriting losses of $1.6 billion in 2017. We incurred estimated losses of approximately $2.4 billion in 2017 from several significant catastrophe loss events occurring during the year including hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, an earthquake in Mexico, a cyclone in Australia and wildfires in California. There were no significant catastrophe loss events in 2016 or 2015. K-35 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) On a combined basis, we also decreased estimated ultimate claims liabilities for prior years’ loss events by $295 million in 2017 compared to $955 million in 2016. The comparative decline reflected higher than expected reported property claims and the effects of increases in certain United Kingdom (“U.K.”) claim liabilities attributable to the U.K. Ministry of Justice’s decision in the first quarter of 2017 to reduce the fixed discount rate required in lump sum settlement calculations of U.K. personal injury claims, known as the Ogden rate, from 2.5% to negative 0.75%. The Ogden rate is subject to adjustment in the future at the discretion of the U.K. Government and significant changes in that rate may have a significant effect on our claim liability estimates. NICO Group’s premiums earned in 2016 increased $233 million (5%) compared to 2015 reflecting the impact of the IAG quota-share contract, partly offset by declines from other business, while General Re Group’s premiums earned declined $236 million (8%) versus 2015. The decline in General Re Group’s premiums earned was primarily due to lower volume in direct and broker market business. Our property/casualty reinsurers produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $895 million in 2016 and $1,095 million in 2015. On a combined basis, we decreased estimated ultimate claims liabilities for prior years’ loss events by $955 million in 2016 and $1.2 billion in 2015. These decreases were primarily attributable to lower than expected reported losses from ceding companies with respect to property coverages. Pre-tax underwriting results in 2016 and 2015 included discount accretion related to certain workers’ compensation claim liabilities of $80 million in 2016 and $82 million in 2015. There was no effect from discounting on 2017 results, as the practice of discounting these related liabilities was discontinued in 2017. Retroactive reinsurance Premiums earned in 2017 included $10.2 billion from an aggregate excess-of-loss retroactive reinsurance agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (the “AIG Agreement”). At the inception of the AIG Agreement, we also recorded losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred of $10.2 billion, representing our initial estimate of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses assumed of $16.4 billion, partly offset by an initial deferred charge asset of $6.2 billion. Thus, on the effective date, the AIG Agreement had no effect on our pre-tax underwriting results. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we increased our ultimate claim liability estimates related to the AIG Agreement by approximately $1.8 billion based on higher than expected loss payments being reported under the contractual retention, which affected our estimate of our liability. We also increased the related deferred charge asset by $1.7 billion based on our re-estimation of the amount and timing of our recorded liabilities. Certain liabilities related to retroactive reinsurance contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies. Underwriting results included pre-tax losses of $264 million in 2017 and pre-tax gains of $392 million in 2016 and $150 million in 2015 associated with the re-measurement of such liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily related to the Great Britain Pound Sterling (“GBP”). Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $1,066 million in 2017, $452 million in 2016 and $620 million in 2015 derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the timing and amount of ultimate losses. Pre-tax losses in 2017 increased compared to 2016, due to amortization charges related to new contracts, including the AIG Agreement, partly offset by lower amortization on prior years’ contracts. Changes in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ contracts were relatively insignificant in 2017 and 2016. During 2015, we increased estimated ultimate liabilities approximately $550 million for prior years’ contracts. The increase in estimated ultimate liabilities, net of related deferred charge adjustments, produced incremental pre-tax underwriting losses of approximately $90 million in 2015. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $42.9 billion at December 31, 2017 and $25.0 billion at December 31, 2016. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts were approximately $15.3 billion at December 31, 2017 and $8.0 billion at December 31, 2016. The increases in unpaid losses and deferred charges were predominantly attributable to the AIG Agreement. Our deferred charge asset balances will be amortized as charges to pre-tax earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement period. K-36 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Life/health Premiums earned and pre-tax underwriting results of our life/health reinsurance businesses are further summarized as follows (in millions). Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 General Re Group $ 3,306 $ 3,068 $ 3,170 $ (369 ) $ 73 $ (18 ) BHLN Group 1,502 1,519 1,500 317 232 148 $ 4,808 $ 4,587 $ 4,670 $ (52 ) $ 305 $ 130 General Re Group’s premiums earned increased $238 million (8%) in 2017 compared to 2016, which reflected growth in the U.S., Asia, Europe and Australia markets. Premiums earned declined $102 million (3%) in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily attributable to foreign currency translation effects and lower volume in Canada, partly offset by increased volume in the United Kingdom and Asia markets. Approximately 65% of BHLN Group’s premiums earned in each of the past three years was derived primarily from a single yearly renewable term life agreement in the U.S. with a major reinsurer. The General Re Group produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $369 million in 2017, gains of $73 million in 2016 and losses of $18 million in 2015. Pre-tax underwriting losses in 2017 included losses of approximately $450 million from the run-off of our U.S. long-term care business driven by discount rate reductions and changes in other actuarial assumptions in the fourth quarter, which increased our estimated benefit liabilities. In 2016, underwriting results reflected increased underwriting gains from our international life business, lower claim severity in North America, and lower losses from changes in actuarial assumptions related to the long-term care business as compared to 2015. BHLN Group’s pre-tax underwriting results included pre-tax gains of $256 million in 2017, $231 million in 2016 and $193 million in 2015 from the run-off of variable annuity business (reinsurance contracts that provide guarantees on closed blocks of variable annuity business). Periodic underwriting results from this business reflect changes in remaining liabilities for guaranteed benefits, resulting from changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Periodic underwriting results from these variable annuity contracts can be volatile, reflecting the volatility of securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Estimated liabilities for variable annuity guarantees were approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2017 and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2016. BHLN Group’s life reinsurance business produced pre-tax gains of $61 million in 2017 and $1 million in 2016 and losses of $45 million in 2015. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned declined $184 million (17%) in 2017 compared to 2016, due to lower volumes. Premiums earned decreased $204 million (16%) in 2016 compared to 2015. Premiums earned in 2015 included $425 million from a single reinsurance contract. Certain periodic payment annuity liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the GBP. Underwriting results included pre-tax losses of $190 million in 2017 and pre-tax gains of $313 million in 2016 and $103 million in 2015 associated with the re-measurement of such liabilities due to changes in exchange rates. Before foreign currency gains and losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $481 million in 2017, $441 million in 2016 and $305 million in 2015. These losses were primarily attributable to the recurring discount accretion on new business and existing liabilities and the impact of lower interest rates in 2017 and 2016, which increased expected future loss payments under certain reinsurance contracts in those years. Discounted annuity liabilities were approximately $11.2 billion at December 31, 2017 and $9.8 billion at December 31, 2016. The weighted average annual discount rate for these liabilities was approximately 4.1% as of December 31, 2017. K-37 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance underwriting businesses that primarily provide a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), and National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company, Applied Underwriters and Central States Indemnity Company. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2017 2016 2015 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 7,483 $ 6,684 $ 5,906 Premiums earned $ 7,143 100.0 $ 6,257 100.0 $ 5,394 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 4,511 63.1 3,864 61.8 3,070 56.9 Underwriting expenses 1,913 26.8 1,736 27.7 1,500 27.8 Total losses and expenses 6,424 89.9 5,600 89.5 4,570 84.7 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 719 $ 657 $ 824 Premiums written in 2017 increased 12.0% compared to 2016. All of the significant BH Primary insurers generated increased premiums written, led by GUARD (26%), BH Specialty (23%) and BHHC (9%). Premiums earned were $7.1 billion in 2017, an increase of $886 million (14.2%) compared to 2016. BH Primary’s premiums written and earned in 2016 increased 13.2% and 16.0%, respectively, compared to 2015. The increases were primarily attributable to volume increases from BH Specialty, MedPro Group, BHHC and GUARD. BH Primary produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $719 million in 2017, $657 million in 2016 and $824 million in 2015. BH Primary’s overall loss ratios were 63.1% in 2017, 61.8% in 2016 and 56.9% in 2015. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2017 included approximately $225 million (3% of premiums earned) related to the significant catastrophe events, primarily hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $766 million in 2017, $503 million in 2016 and $643 million in 2015, which produced corresponding increases in pre-tax underwriting gains. The reductions of prior years’ estimates in each year primarily related to healthcare malpractice and workers’ compensation business. BH Primary writes significant levels of liability and workers’ compensation business and the related claim costs may be subject to higher severity and longer claims-tails, which could contribute to significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher than expected claim settlements, adverse litigation or judicial rulings and other factors we have not anticipated. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income generated from investments held by our insurance operations follows (in millions). 2017 2016 2015 Interest income $ 1,310 $ 930 $ 888 Dividend income 3,592 3,552 3,662 Investment income before taxes and noncontrolling interests 4,902 4,482 4,550 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 985 846 825 Net investment income $ 3,917 $ 3,636 $ 3,725 K-38 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Pre-tax investment income increased $420 million (9%) in 2017 compared to 2016, attributable to an increase in interest income which reflected higher interest rates on short-term investments and increased other investment income. Pre-tax investment income in 2016 declined $68 million (1.5%) compared to 2015, reflecting lower dividend income attributable to portfolio changes, partly offset by an increase in interest income. We continue to hold significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills earning low yields. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to such balances. Dividend income in 2017 was relatively unchanged compared to 2016 reflecting increased dividend rates and increased overall investment levels, offset by the impact of the conversion of our $3 billion investment in Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) 8.5% preferred stock into Dow common stock at the end of 2016. Prior to its conversion, we received dividends of $255 million per annum. In December 2017, RBI redeemed our $3 billion investment in 9% RBI Preferred stock investment, which will negatively affect investment income in 2018 when compared to 2017. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $114 billion at December 31, 2017 and $91 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase in float in 2017 reflected increases in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts written in 2017 and estimated liabilities related to catastrophe events, and overall growth of our insurance operations, partly offset by an increase in deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts. Our pre-tax underwriting losses were approximately $3.2 billion in 2017 and our average cost of float was approximately 3.0%. During the prior fourteen years, the cost of float was negative as our insurance business generated pre-tax underwriting gains in each year. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 follows (in millions).

K-39 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF operates approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states and also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF’s major business groups are classified by type of product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (in millions). 2017 2016 2015 Revenues $ 21,387 $ 19,829 $ 21,967 Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 4,969 4,769 5,043 Fuel 2,518 1,934 2,656 Purchased services 2,514 2,418 2,546 Depreciation and amortization 2,352 2,128 2,001 Equipment rents, materials and other 1,690 1,895 2,018 Total operating expenses 14,043 13,144 14,264 Interest expense 1,016 992 928 15,059 14,136 15,192 Pre-tax earnings 6,328 5,693 6,775 Income taxes 2,369 2,124 2,527 Net earnings $ 3,959 $ 3,569 $ 4,248 Consolidated revenues were $21.4 billion in 2017, representing an increase of $1.6 billion (7.9%) versus 2016. Pre-tax earnings increased 11.2% in 2017 compared to 2016. During 2017, consolidated revenues reflected a 2.4% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit and a 5.3% increase in volume. Our volume was 10.3 million cars/units in 2017 compared to 9.8 million in 2016. Our overall volume growth moderated in the second half of the year compared to the growth experienced in the first half of the year. While we believe the general economy will continue to be strong in 2018, we expect a slower pace of volume growth. The increase in average revenue per car/unit was primarily attributable to higher fuel surcharge revenue, increased rates per car/unit and business mix changes. Revenues from consumer products were $7.1 billion in 2017, representing an increase of 8.8% compared to 2016, reflecting volume increases of 6.3% as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increases were primarily attributable to improving economic conditions, normalizing of retail inventories, new services and higher market share, which benefited domestic intermodal, international intermodal and automotive volumes. Revenues from industrial products were $5.1 billion in 2017, an increase of 7.7% from 2016, attributable to a volume increase of 5.0% as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes in 2017 were higher for sand and other commodities that support drilling. In addition, broad strengthening in the industrial sector drove greater demand for steel and taconite. These volume increases were partially offset by lower petroleum products volume due to pipeline displacement of U.S. crude rail traffic. Revenues from agricultural products increased 1.8% to $4.3 billion in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes were relatively flat, primarily due to higher shipments of domestic grain, as well as ethanol and other grain products, offset by lower grain exports. Revenues from coal increased 13.7% to $3.8 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. This increase reflected higher average revenue per car/unit as well as 6.3% higher volumes. The volume increases in 2017 were due to continued effects of higher natural gas prices, which led to increased utility coal usage. This was partially offset by the effects of unit retirements at coal generating facilities, increased renewable generation and coal inventory adjustments at customer facilities. Operating expenses were $14.0 billion in 2017, an increase of $899 million (6.8%) compared to 2016. Our ratio of operating expenses to revenues decreased 0.6 percentage points to 65.7% in 2017 versus 2016. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $200 million (4.2%) compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher health and welfare costs and volume-related increases, partially offset by lower headcount. Fuel expenses increased $584 million (30.2%) compared to 2016 primarily due to higher average fuel prices and increased volumes. K-40 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Depreciation and amortization expense increased $224 million (10.5%) compared to 2016 due to a larger base of depreciable assets in service. Equipment rents, materials and other expense declined $205 million (10.8%) compared to 2016. These declines resulted from the impact of the enactment of the TCJA on an equity method subsidiary, as well as lower personal injury and casualty related costs. Consolidated revenues were approximately $19.8 billion in 2016, a decrease of $2.1 billion (9.7%) compared to 2015. Pre-tax earnings were $5.7 billion in 2016, a decrease of $1.1 billion (16.0%) compared to 2015. Our total volume was approximately 9.8 million cars/units in 2016 compared to approximately 10.3 million in 2015. In 2016, we experienced declining demand, especially in our coal and crude oil categories. Coal had the largest decline, driven by structural changes in that business as well as competition from low natural gas prices. The decrease in revenue reflected comparative declines in average revenue per car/unit (5.2%) and volumes (5.0%). The decrease in average revenue per car/unit was primarily attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue driven by lower fuel prices and business mix changes. Revenues from consumer products were $6.5 billion in 2016, a decline of 0.9% from 2015, reflecting lower average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by volume increases of 1%. Consumer products volumes increased primarily due to higher domestic intermodal volumes and the addition of a new automotive customer, partially offset by lower international intermodal volumes. Revenues from industrial products were $4.8 billion in 2016, a decline of 14.2% compared with 2015. The decrease was attributable to lower volumes, primarily for petroleum products, reflecting pipeline displacement of U.S. crude rail traffic and lower U.S. oil production. In addition, we experienced lower demand for steel and taconite, partially offset by increased plastics products volume. Revenues from agricultural products remained relatively unchanged in 2016 at $4.2 billion compared to 2015. Agricultural product volume increased by 6.3%, primarily due to higher corn, soybean and wheat exports, which offset a decrease in average revenue per car/unit. Revenues from coal decreased 26.9% to $3.4 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting a 21.1% decline in volumes and a lower average rate per car/unit. Demand for coal declined due to reduced energy consumption, coal unit retirements, high coal stockpiles and low natural gas prices. Operating expenses were $13.1 billion in 2016, a decrease of $1.1 billion (7.9%) compared to 2015, and our ratio of operating expenses to revenues increased 1.4 percentage points to 66.3%. Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $274 million (5.4%) compared to 2015. The decline was primarily due to lower employment levels resulting from lower freight volumes and productivity improvements, partially offset by inflation. Fuel expenses declined $722 million (27.2%) compared to 2015, due to lower average fuel prices and lower volumes. Purchased services declined $128 million (5.0%) due to lower volumes and cost reductions. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $127 million (6.3%) compared to 2015 due to increased assets in service reflecting our ongoing capital additions and improvement programs. Equipment rents, materials and other expense declined $123 million (6.1%) compared to 2015, primarily due to lower freight volumes and productivity improvements. Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) We hold a 90.2% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. Other energy businesses include AltaLink, L.P. (“AltaLink”), a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada and a diversified portfolio of independent power projects. In addition, BHE also operates the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. K-41 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based, in large part, on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent these operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. Revenues and earnings of BHE are summarized below (in millions).

Revenues increased 1% in 2017 compared to 2016. Wholesale and other revenues increased, reflecting higher volumes and average rates, and retail revenues decreased slightly, attributable to lower average rates, partly offset by higher volumes. Pre-tax earnings increased $26 million (2%) in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in earnings reflected higher gross margins (operating revenues less cost of sales), lower operations and maintenance expenses, and increased depreciation and amortization attributable to additional plant in-service. Revenues were $5.25 billion in 2016, a slight decline from 2015, reflecting increased retail revenues and lower wholesale and other operating revenues. The increase in retail revenues was primarily due to higher retail rates as volumes were relatively unchanged. The declines in wholesale revenues were attributable to lower volumes and average prices. Pre-tax earnings in 2016 increased $79 million (7.7%) from 2015, primarily due to increased gross margins, reflecting lower fuel prices and changes in fuel mix. MidAmerican Energy Company MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. Revenues increased $238 million (9%) in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily attributable to higher electric operating revenues ($123 million) and increased natural gas operating revenues ($82 million). Our retail electric revenues increased $84 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily attributable to higher recoveries through bill riders (which are substantially offset by increases in costs of sales and other expenses) and from non-weather usage and growth and rate factors, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of milder temperatures in 2017. Our wholesale electric and other revenues increased $39 million in 2017 versus 2016, attributable to comparative increases in volumes, average rates and transmission fees. The natural gas operating revenues increase was primarily due to higher average per-unit costs of gas sold, which was offset by an increase in cost of sales. Pre-tax earnings declined $20 million (5%) in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting increased depreciation, maintenance and other operating expenses and interest expense and debt extinguishment costs, partially offset by comparative increases in electric gross sales margins of $76 million. Revenues increased $114 million (4.5%) in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased electric revenues ($148 million), partially offset by lower natural gas revenues ($24 million). The increase in electric revenues resulted primarily from a 3.8% increase in customer volumes and higher rates. Wholesale and other revenues increased primarily due to increased average wholesale prices and higher transmission revenue. The natural gas revenue decline was primarily due to lower average per-unit costs of gas sold ($42 million), partly offset by higher wholesale volumes. Pre-tax earnings increased $100 million (34.2%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in pre-tax earnings was primarily due to increased gross margins from electric revenues and lower operations and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization from additional assets placed in service, and higher interest expense. K-42 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) NV Energy NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. Revenues increased $123 million (4%) in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was due primarily to an increase in retail electric operating revenues, which included a combination of increased rates from pass-through cost adjustments and higher volumes, partly offset by lower revenues from energy efficiency programs (offset by lower operating expenses). NV Energy also experienced retail electric revenue declines from the transition of certain commercial and industrial customers electing to purchase power from alternative sources and thus becoming distribution service only customers. Natural gas operating revenue declined $11 million in 2017, primarily due to lower rates, partially offset by higher customer usage. Pre-tax earnings increased $8 million (1%) in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower interest expenses. Revenues were approximately $2.9 billion in 2016, a decrease of $457 million (13.5%) versus 2015. The decline was primarily attributable to lower electric retail rates resulting from lower energy costs. Electric retail volumes were relatively unchanged. Pre-tax earnings declined $27 million (4.6%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The decline was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses of $39 million, partly offset by a decrease in interest expense of $17 million. The increase in operating expenses reflected higher depreciation and amortization and reductions of certain accrued liabilities in 2015. Northern Powergrid Revenues declined $47 million (5%) in 2017 compared to 2016. Unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a comparatively stronger U.S. Dollar in 2017 resulted in a $48 million comparative decline in revenues, substantially all of which occurred in the first half of the year. Otherwise, we experienced comparative declines in distribution revenues, which were substantially offset by higher smart metering revenue. Pre-tax earnings declined $56 million (15%) in 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The decline was primarily due to foreign currency translation effects, as well as from increased pension expenses and lower distribution revenues, partially offset by lower asset impairment charges and lower distribution costs. Revenues declined $144 million (12.6%) in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar ($127 million) and lower distribution revenues. Pre-tax earnings declined $93 million (20.2%) to $367 million. The decline was due to lower distribution revenues and the stronger U.S. Dollar, as well as increases in depreciation expense from increased assets in service and higher asset impairment charges. Natural Gas Pipelines Revenues increased $23 million (2%) in 2017 compared to 2016. Northern Natural Gas produced higher transportation revenues and higher gas sales, primarily from system balancing activities (largely offset in cost of sales), which were partly offset by lower transportation revenues at Kern River. Pre-tax earnings increased $33 million (8%) in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to the increase in transportation revenues and a reduction in expenses and regulatory liabilities related to the impact of an alternative rate structure approved by Kern River’s regulators in the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Revenues declined $32 million (3.1%) in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to the impact of lower gas sales from balancing activities and lower transportation revenues from lower volumes and rates, in part due to comparatively milder temperatures in the first quarter of 2016. Pre-tax earnings increased $12 million (3.0%) versus 2015, reflecting lower interest expense, resulting from lower average debt balances and lower operating expenses, partly offset by the lower transportation revenues. Other energy businesses Revenues increased 3% in 2017 compared to 2016. AltaLink’s operating revenues increased $197 million (39%) in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to effects of a decision in 2016 by its regulator, which changed the timing of when construction-in-progress expenditures included in the rate base are billable to customers and earned in revenues. The decision resulted in a one-time net reduction in revenue in 2016, with offsetting reductions in expenses. In 2017, we also experienced a comparative revenue increase of 13% from renewable energy and a comparative decline of 12% from the unregulated retail services business. Pre-tax earnings in 2017 were relatively unchanged from 2016, as increased earnings from renewable energy and AltaLink were offset by lower earnings from the unregulated retail services business and other energy ventures. K-43 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) Other energy businesses (Continued) Revenues declined $98 million (4.2%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The decline in comparative revenues was principally attributable to lower revenues from AltaLink and from our unregulated retail services business. AltaLink’s revenue decline reflected the impact of the aforementioned regulatory decision by AltaLink’s regulator. Pre-tax earnings declined $17 million (4.3%) compared to 2015, primarily due to lower earnings from our renewable energy businesses, primarily due to higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in service. Real estate brokerage Revenues increased 23% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to business acquisitions and an increase in average home sales prices. Pre-tax earnings decreased 2% in 2017 as compared to 2016. Earnings in 2017 included increased earnings from franchise businesses, partially offset by lower earnings from brokerage businesses, primarily due to higher operating expenses. Revenues increased 11.0% to $2.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to increased closed brokerage transactions (primarily resulting from business acquisitions) and a 2% increase in average home sales prices, as well as higher mortgage revenues. Pre-tax earnings increased $34 million (17.8%) in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the increases in mortgage revenues. Corporate interest and income taxes Corporate interest includes interest on unsecured debt issued by BHE and borrowings from Berkshire insurance subsidiaries in connection with BHE’s acquisitions of NV Energy and AltaLink. Corporate interest in 2017 included pre-tax charges of $410 million from a tender offer completed in December 2017 to redeem certain long-term debt of BHE. Otherwise, corporate interest declined 7% in 2017 and 2016 compared to the corresponding prior years, primarily due to lower average borrowings. BHE’s consolidated effective income tax rates were approximately 7% in 2017, 14% in 2016 and 16% in 2015. BHE’s effective income tax rates regularly reflect significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation placed in service. In addition, income tax rates applicable to Northern Powergrid and AltaLink were lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate. The effective tax rate in 2017 decreased primarily due to an increase in recognized production tax credits. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, retailing and service businesses follows (in millions). Revenues Earnings * 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 Manufacturing $ 50,445 $ 46,506 $ 36,136 $ 6,861 $ 6,211 $ 4,893 Service and retailing 76,088 73,553 71,689 2,382 2,251 2,222 $ 126,533 $ 120,059 $ 107,825 Pre-tax earnings 9,243 8,462 7,115 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 3,035 2,831 2,432 $ 6,208 $ 5,631 $ 4,683 * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which primarily related to the amortization of identified intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings above were $896 million in 2017, $771 million in 2016 and $476 million in 2015. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page K-32 and in the “Other” earnings section on page K-51. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of businesses that produce industrial, building and consumer products. Industrial products businesses include specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International (“CTB”)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products (“LSPI”)). Beginning on January 29, 2016, our industrial products group also includes Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), a leading manufacturer of complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets. K-44 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Manufacturing (Continued) Our building products businesses include flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore), and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). Our consumer products businesses include leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports), and beginning February 29, 2016, the Duracell Company (“Duracell”), a leading manufacturer of high performance alkaline batteries. This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (in millions). Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 Industrial products $ 26,376 $ 24,702 $ 16,760 $ 4,367 $ 4,209 $ 2,994 Building products 11,936 10,772 10,316 1,382 1,178 1,167 Consumer products 12,133 11,032 9,060 1,112 824 732 $ 50,445 $ 46,506 $ 36,136 $ 6,861 $ 6,211 $ 4,893 Revenues of our manufacturers were approximately $50.4 billion in 2017, an increase of approximately $3.9 billion (8.5%) over 2016, which increased approximately $10.4 billion (28.7%) over 2015. Pre-tax earnings were approximately $6.9 billion in 2017, an increase of $650 million (10.5%) over 2016 and earnings in 2016 increased $1.3 billion (26.9%) compared to 2015. Industrial products Industrial products revenues were approximately $26.4 billion in 2017, an increase of approximately $1.7 billion (6.8%) versus 2016, reflecting increased revenues at several of our businesses. PCC’s revenues increased $754 million (9%) in 2017 compared to the eleven month post-acquisition period in 2016. On a comparable full year-to-date basis, PCC’s revenues increased approximately 2.3% compared to 2016, reflecting increases in aerospace and oil and gas markets, partially offset by declines in other power markets. In 2017, PCC produced revenue increases from structural castings, airfoils and forged products and from business acquisitions, partly offset by lower revenues from airframe products and industrial gas turbine products used in power markets. PCC continues to transition into product lines for new programs within the aerospace markets, which we expect will produce future revenue increases, but may have negative effects on revenues in the near term as prior programs wind down. IMC’s revenues increased 13%, primarily due to increased customer demand and unit sales and from business acquisitions. The global demand for cutting tools was generally higher in 2017. Marmon’s revenues increased $349 million (7%) in 2017 versus 2016, primarily due to business acquisitions and higher average metal prices, partly offset by lower overall volumes and changes in mix. Marmon’s highway transportation, retail food and restaurant equipment businesses experienced volume-based revenue growth in 2017, which was more than offset by declines at the engineered wire/cable and retail store products businesses. Lubrizol’s revenues increased $165 million (3%) compared to 2016, primarily due to higher unit volumes, partly offset by effects of the disposition of an underperforming business in 2016. CTB’s revenues increased 5% in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase reflected the impact of a bolt-on business acquisition, partly offset by weak demand in the U.S. egg and poultry production markets and selling price pressures for grain storage systems. Pre-tax earnings of our industrial products businesses in 2017 increased $158 million (3.8%) compared to 2016. Overall, pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 16.6% in 2017 and 17.0% in 2016. PCC’s pre-tax earnings decreased 12.5% in 2017 compared to the post-acquisition period in 2016, primarily due to certain one-time inventory and impairment charges that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Pre-tax earnings from IMC and Marmon increased in 2017 compared to 2016, due to a combination of increased sales, increased manufacturing efficiencies, the effects of business acquisitions and ongoing expense control efforts. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings increased 17% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to comparatively lower earnings charges related to the disposition in 2016 of an underperforming bolt-on business and ongoing cost containment efforts, partly offset by lower gross sales margins, which were primarily attributable to higher average raw material prices. In 2017, average raw material prices at Lubrizol, including base oil feedstock and petrochemicals, increased about 9% versus 2016. K-45 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Industrial products revenues increased approximately $7.9 billion (47.4%) in 2016 versus 2015, primarily due to the inclusion of PCC, partially offset by revenue declines of $859 million (5.1%) across our other businesses. Sales volumes of our other businesses declined compared to 2015, reflecting sluggish demand for many product categories, particularly for products sold to businesses in the oil and gas and heavy equipment industries. In addition, lower average costs of oil-based raw materials and metals and increased competitive pressures continued to lower average selling prices. Pre-tax earnings increased $1.2 billion (40.6%) in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting the inclusion of PCC, partially offset by comparative earnings declines from our other businesses. Lubrizol’s earnings in 2016 included pre-tax losses of $365 million related to the aforementioned disposition of an underperforming business. Earnings from several of Marmon’s manufacturing businesses and Lubrizol’s continuing operations declined, while earnings from IMC increased slightly. Generally, our earnings in 2016 reflected the negative effects of a combination of weaker customer demand, sales price and mix changes, and increased restructuring costs, partially offset by the favorable effects of cost containment initiatives and lower average material prices. Building products Building products revenues were approximately $11.9 billion in 2017, an increase of approximately $1.2 billion (10.8%) compared to 2016. Approximately half of the increase was attributable to bolt-on business acquisitions by Shaw and MiTek. The remainder of the increase reflected sales volume increases at MiTek, Benjamin Moore and Johns Manville, partly offset by changes in prices and product mix. Pre-tax earnings were $1.4 billion in 2017, an increase of $204 million (17.3%) compared to 2016. The comparative earnings increase reflected the fact that approximately $107 million of asset impairment, pension settlement and environmental claim charges were recorded in 2016 by Shaw and Benjamin Moore. The comparative earnings increase also was a result of bolt-on acquisitions, partly offset by comparative declines in average gross sales margin rates due to higher raw material and other production costs. Revenues increased $456 million (4.4%) in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting volume-driven revenue increases by MiTek, Johns Manville, Acme and Shaw, as well as revenues from bolt-on acquisitions by Shaw and MiTek. The revenue increase reflected increased unit sales across several product categories, partly offset by lower average sales prices and changes in product mix. Pre-tax earnings increased $11 million (0.9%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The favorable effects of increased sales volume and lower manufacturing costs in 2016 attributable to deflation in certain commodity unit costs, were substantially offset by increased charges for asset impairments, pension settlements and environmental claims. Consumer products Consumer products revenues were approximately $12.1 billion in 2017, an increase of $1.1 billion (10%) compared to 2016, driven by comparative revenue increases from Duracell and Forest River. Duracell’s revenues increased 25.3% in 2017 compared to the ten-month post-acquisition period in 2016. Forest River’s revenues increased 13.7% in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting a 13.5% comparative increase in units sold. Apparel and footwear revenues were approximately $4.2 billion in 2017, an increase of 1.6% compared to 2016. Pre-tax earnings increased $288 million (35%) in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in earnings was primarily due to increased earnings from Duracell and Forest River. Pre-tax earnings from Duracell were $82 million in 2017, compared to a pre-tax loss of $89 million in 2016, which included significant transition costs arising from the acquisition. The improvement in operating results in 2017 reflects an overall reduction in transition costs and the positive effects of ongoing restructuring and business development efforts. Forest River’s earnings increased 23% in 2017, primarily attributable to the increase in sales and lower manufacturing overhead rates. Earnings from apparel and footwear businesses increased 5% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased earnings from the footwear businesses. Revenues were approximately $11.0 billion in 2016, an increase of approximately $2.0 billion (21.8%) compared to 2015. The increase reflected the inclusion of Duracell and a 12% increase in Forest River’s revenues, primarily attributable to increased unit sales. Apparel revenues declined $81 million (1.9%) in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting lower footwear sales and the impact of a divestiture by Fruit of the Loom. K-46 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Consumer products (Continued) Pre-tax earnings increased $92 million (12.6%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The earnings increase reflected increased earnings from Forest River and apparel and footwear businesses, partly offset by pre-tax losses of Duracell. In 2016, Duracell incurred a pre-tax loss of approximately $89 million primarily due to significant transition, business integration and restructuring costs. Forest River generated a pre-tax earnings increase of 28%, primarily due to increased sales volumes and higher gross margins. Earnings of our apparel businesses increased 22% in 2016, primarily attributable to lower restructuring costs and a loss in 2015 from the disposition of a Fruit of the Loom operation, partly offset by lower earnings from our footwear businesses. Service and retailing Our service and retailing businesses are comprised of a large group of independently managed businesses engaged in a variety of activities. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of these operations follows (in millions). Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 Service $ 11,249 $ 10,386 $ 10,201 $ 1,298 $ 1,161 $ 1,156 Retailing 15,064 15,092 13,265 785 659 564 McLane Company 49,775 48,075 48,223 299 431 502 $ 76,088 $ 73,553 $ 71,689 $ 2,382 $ 2,251 $ 2,222 Service Our service businesses offer fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI) and franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen). Other service businesses include the electronic distribution of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire), publication of newspapers (Buffalo News and the BH Media Group) and operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Also included in this group is a third party logistics business that primarily serves the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). Service business revenues were $11.2 billion in 2017, an increase of $863 million (8%) compared to 2016, primarily attributable to comparative increases at TTI and NetJets. TTI’s sales increased 16% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher customer demand. NetJets’ revenues increased due to an increase in revenue flight hours and increased aircraft management service revenues. Pre-tax earnings were $1.3 billion in 2017, an increase of $137 million (12%) compared to 2016. The comparative increase in earnings was primarily attributable to increased earnings of NetJets and TTI, partly offset by lower earnings from FlightSafety, as well as our media and logistics businesses. Revenues increased 1.8% to $10.4 billion in 2016, primarily due to revenue increases from TTI and Charter Brokerage, partly offset by a revenue decrease from NetJets. TTI’s revenues increased 7.2%, primarily due to sales volume increases in Asia, Europe and through the Internet, while the increase from Charter Brokerage primarily derived from a commodity trading business launched in 2015. NetJets’ revenues decreased 2.0% reflecting lower aircraft sales. Pre-tax earnings were $1.2 billion in 2016, relatively unchanged versus 2015, reflecting increased earnings from NetJets and lower earnings from our newspaper operations. NetJets’ earnings increased 19%, primarily due to lower subcontracting expense and a decline in losses from aircraft impairments and dispositions, partly offset by increases in depreciation and restructuring charges and reduced aircraft sales margins. TTI’s earnings were relatively unchanged, as changes in geographic sales mix and price competition produced lower gross margin rates, substantially offsetting the aforementioned revenue increase. Retailing Our retailers include Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”), which we acquired in the first quarter of 2015. BHA includes over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles, and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. K-47 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) Our other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories acquired in the second quarter of 2015. Retailing revenues were $15.1 billion in 2017, slightly lower than 2016. BHA’s aggregate revenues, which represented 63% of our total retailing revenues, declined 1.3% in 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to a 3.7% decline in new and used cars sold, partly offset by higher service and finance and insurance revenues. Revenues of our other retailers increased 1.7% in 2017 compared to 2016. Pre-tax earnings increased $126 million (19%) in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase reflected comparatively higher earnings from BHA, primarily due to increased earnings from finance and insurance activities and lower selling and administrative expenses, partly offset by lower auto sales volumes and margins. Pre-tax earnings of our home furnishings retailers increased 6.5% in 2017 compared to 2016. Pampered Chef also produced comparatively higher earnings in 2017, primarily attributable to revenue increases and expense management efforts. Retailing revenues increased $1.8 billion (13.8%) in 2016 to $15.1 billion as compared to 2015. The acquisitions of BHA and Louis accounted for approximately $1.6 billion of the comparative increase. Home furnishings’ revenues increased $227 million (7.8%), primarily due to new stores opened in 2015 by Nebraska Furniture Mart and Jordan’s, as well as modest organic growth. Pre-tax earnings increased $95 million (16.8%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase reflected the impact of the BHA and Louis acquisitions and increased earnings from most of our other retailers, which benefitted from a combination of revenue increases and cost savings initiatives. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales volumes and very low profit margins and have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven and Yum! Brands. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. McLane’s revenues were approximately $49.8 billion in 2017, an increase of 3.5% compared to 2016. The increase in revenues was primarily due to a 4.7% increase in grocery business sales. Pre-tax earnings in 2017 were $299 million, a decrease of $132 million (31%) compared to 2016. The earnings decline reflected a 57% decline in earnings from our grocery operations, partly offset by a $39 million increase in gains from asset sales. Throughout 2017, significant pricing pressures and an increasingly competitive business environment negatively affected our operating results, particularly with respect to the grocery business. These conditions contributed to declining gross margin rates, which together with increases in fuel, depreciation and certain other operating expenses produced a 29 basis point decline in our consolidated operating margin rate (ratio of pre-tax earnings to revenues) in 2017 compared to 2016. Our grocery and foodservice businesses will likely continue to be subject to intense competition in 2018. Revenues were $48.1 billion in 2016, a decline of $148 million (0.3%) compared to 2015. In 2016, we experienced a decline in grocery revenues, partly offset by an increase in foodservice revenues. Earnings were $431 million in 2016, a decrease of $71 million (14%) compared to 2015. The reduced earnings was primarily due to a reduction in McLane’s operating margin rate. The decline was primarily due to increased employee related costs. Additionally, earnings in 2015 included a gain of $19 million from the disposition of a subsidiary. K-48 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Finance and Financial Products Our finance and financial products businesses include manufactured housing and finance (Clayton Homes), transportation equipment manufacturing and leasing businesses (UTLX and XTRA, and together, “transportation equipment leasing”), as well as other leasing and financing activities. A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows (in millions). Revenues Earnings 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 Manufactured housing and finance $ 5,010 $ 4,230 $ 3,576 $ 765 $ 744 $ 706 Transportation equipment leasing 2,609 2,650 2,540 869 959 909 Other 757 795 848 424 427 471 $ 8,376 $ 7,675 $ 6,964 Pre-tax earnings 2,058 2,130 2,086 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 723 703 708 $ 1,335 $ 1,427 $ 1,378 Manufactured housing and finance Clayton Homes’ revenues were $5.0 billion in 2017, an increase of $780 million (18%) compared to 2016. The revenues increase was primarily due to higher home sales, attributable to an increase in overall unit sales (9%) and higher average prices. The increase in average prices was primarily due to sales mix changes, which reflected increases in site built home sales, a relatively new business for Clayton. Site built homes include higher land content and unit prices tend to be higher, although gross sales margin rates are typically lower than manufactured homes. Interest and financial services revenues increased 2% in 2017 compared to 2016. Pre-tax earnings increased $21 million (2.8%) in 2017 compared to 2016. Pre-tax earnings in 2017 from manufacturing, retailing and site built activities increased, while earnings from finance activities declined slightly from 2016. Earnings in 2017 also included a gain from a legal settlement, offset by increased employee healthcare, technology, marketing and other expenses. A significant portion of Clayton Homes’ earnings are generated from lending activities, which in recent years benefitted from relatively low delinquency rates and loan losses and from low average interest rates on borrowings. As of December 31, 2017, Clayton Homes’ installment loan portfolio was approximately $13.7 billion. Revenues increased $654 million (18%) in 2016 compared to 2015, attributable to a 30% increase in revenues from home sales, primarily due to a 25% increase in units sold and product mix changes. Interest and other financial service income increased 1.8% from 2015. Pre-tax earnings increased $38 million (5.4%) compared to 2015. Earnings benefitted from increased home sales and improved manufacturing and retailing operating margins, partly offset by lower earnings from lending and financial services and increased insurance losses. Transportation equipment leasing Transportation equipment leasing revenues declined $41 million (2%) in 2017 compared to 2016. The revenue decline was due to lower railcar and trailer units on lease and lower railcar lease rates. We currently believe industry railcar capacity available for lease exceeds demand, which is contributing to lower lease rates. We also experienced increased other service revenues, primarily attributable to business acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Pre-tax earnings declined $90 million (9%) in 2017 compared to 2016. Earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased from 36.2% in 2016 to 33.3% in 2017. These decreases reflected the aforementioned lease revenue declines and higher railcar repair, storage costs and depreciation expense. Significant components of our operating costs, such as depreciation expense, do not vary proportionately to revenue changes and therefore changes in revenues can produce a disproportionate effect on earnings. In response to weakened demand in the railcar and oil and gas industries, we undertook overhead cost reduction initiatives. Transportation equipment leasing revenues increased $110 million (4.3%) in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily from the acquisition of General Electric Company’s tank car fleet and its railcar repair services business in 2015 and increased rates and tank car additions. These revenue increases were partly offset by lower utilization rates, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, lower crane lease demand in North America and reduced volume related to oil and gas markets. K-49 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Finance and Financial Products (Continued) Transportation equipment leasing (Continued) Pre-tax earnings increased $50 million (5.5%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to revenue growth and lower depreciation rates on certain tank car assets, partially offset by higher repair costs and interest expense on borrowings from a Berkshire financing subsidiary. Other Other finance activities include CORT furniture leasing, our share of the earnings of a commercial mortgage servicing business (“Berkadia”) in which we own a 50% interest, and interest and dividends from loans and equity security investments. Pre-tax earnings were $424 million in 2017, relatively unchanged from 2016, and reflected lower earnings from CORT, partly offset by slightly higher interest and finance income. Other earnings also includes income from interest rate spreads charged on borrowings by a Berkshire financing subsidiary that are used to finance installment loans made by Clayton Homes and assets held for lease by UTLX. Other earnings in 2016 were $427 million, a decrease of $44 million compared to 2015. The decline reflected lower earnings from investment securities, partly offset by increased earnings from CORT and Berkadia. Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows (in millions). 2017 2016 2015 Investment gains/losses $ 1,410 $ 7,553 $ 9,373 Derivative gains/losses 718 751 974 Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 2,128 8,304 10,347 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 751 1,807 3,622 Net gains/losses $ 1,377 $ 6,497 $ 6,725 Investment gains/losses Investment gains/losses arise primarily from the sale, redemption or exchange of investments. The timing of gains or losses can have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses included in earnings usually have minimal impact on the periodic changes in our consolidated shareholders’ equity since most of our investments are recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical or predictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will have on our reported earnings. Although we do not consider investment gains and losses as necessarily meaningful or useful in evaluating our periodic results, we provide information to explain the nature of such gains and losses when reflected in our earnings. As discussed in Note 1(u) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we adopted a new accounting standard on January 1, 2018 that changes the reporting of unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities. Beginning as of that date, unrealized gains and losses on investments in equity securities will be included in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings along with realized gains and losses from dispositions. This new standard does not permit the restatement of prior years’ statements of earnings. Upon adoption of this accounting standard, we reclassified net after-tax unrealized gains of $61.5 billion related to our investments in equity securities from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. While the adoption of this standard did not affect our consolidated shareholders’ equity, it will almost certainly produce a very significant increase in the volatility of our periodic net earnings in the future given the magnitude of our existing equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. To illustrate the impact of this standard, our other comprehensive income for the year ending December 31, 2017 included after-tax net unrealized gains from equity securities of approximately $19 billion. Had the new accounting standard been in effect as of the beginning of 2017, this amount would have been included in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. However, our consolidated comprehensive income for the period would have been unchanged. K-50 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) Investment gains/losses (Continued) Pre-tax investment gains were approximately $1.4 billion in 2017, $7.6 billion in 2016 and $9.4 billion in 2015. Investment gains in 2016 included $4.2 billion from the redemptions of our Wrigley and Kraft Heinz preferred stock investments and from the sales of Dow Chemical common stock that was received upon the conversion of our Dow Chemical preferred stock investment. We also realized pre-tax gains of $1.1 billion in connection with the tax-free exchange of our shares of P&G common stock for 100% of the common stock of Duracell. Income tax expense allocated to investment gains in 2016 included a benefit from the reduction of certain deferred income tax liabilities in connection with the exchange of P&G common stock for Duracell. Our after-tax gain from this transaction was approximately $1.9 billion. Pre-tax investment gains in 2015 included non-cash holding gains related to our investment in Kraft Heinz of $6.8 billion. In connection with its acquisition of Kraft Foods on July 2, 2015, Kraft Heinz issued new shares of its common stock in exchange for the outstanding shares of Kraft Foods common stock, thus reducing Berkshire’s ownership interest in Kraft Heinz by approximately 50%. Under the equity method of accounting, such transactions are treated by the investor as if it sold a portion of its interests. Derivative gains/losses Derivative gains/losses primarily represented the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying equity markets and the changes in the inputs used to measure such liabilities. Changes in the values of our equity index put option contract liabilities produced pre-tax gains of $718 million in 2017, $662 million in 2016 and $1.0 billion in 2015. The gains in each year reflected the effects of shorter remaining contract durations and overall higher index values. As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate intrinsic value of our equity put option contracts was approximately $800 million and our recorded liability was approximately $2.2 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates (beginning in June 2018), and will be based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. In July 2016, our last credit default contract was terminated by mutual agreement with the counterparty and we paid the counterparty $195 million. This contract produced pre-tax earnings of $89 million in 2016 and pre-tax losses of $34 million in 2015. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings (losses) which include corporate income (including income from our investments in Kraft Heinz), expenses and income taxes not allocated to operating businesses is summarized below (in millions). 2017 2016 2015 Kraft Heinz earnings $ 972 $ 706 $ 841 Acquisition accounting expenses (936) (846) (515) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (266) (256) (146) Corporate interest expense – Euro note foreign exchange gains (losses) (655) 159 (45) Other 59 (106) (105) Net earnings (losses) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ (826) $ (343) $ 30 Our after-tax Kraft Heinz earnings includes Berkshire’s share of Kraft Heinz’s earnings attributable to common shareholders determined pursuant to the equity method. Our after-tax Kraft Heinz earnings in 2017 excludes approximately $1.1 billion from the net effects of the TCJA on Kraft Heinz’s net earnings. Kraft Heinz earnings included pre-tax dividend income from our preferred stock investment of $180 million in 2016 and $852 million in 2015. Kraft Heinz redeemed the preferred stock in June 2016. After-tax other earnings (losses) also include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges were primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. In each of the last three years, Berkshire issued Euro-denominated debt and at December 31, 2017, the aggregate par amount outstanding was €6.85 billion. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can produce sizable non-cash gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The increase in interest expense in 2016 over 2015 before those gains and losses was primarily attributable to increased average outstanding debt. K-51 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2017 was $348.3 billion, an increase of $65.3 billion since December 31, 2016 (based upon shareholders’ equity as originally reported in our 2016 Form 10-K). Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in 2017 were $44.9 billion. Net unrealized appreciation of investments and foreign currency translation gains included in other comprehensive income in 2017 were approximately $18.9 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2017, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of approximately $104.0 billion and investments (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) of $185.4 billion. In 2017, Berkshire issued €1.1 billion of senior notes and repaid $1.1 billion of maturing senior notes. Berkshire’s outstanding debt at December 31, 2017 was approximately $18.8 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from December 31, 2016, of which $990 million was attributable to foreign currency exchange rate changes applicable to the €6.85 billion par amount of Euro-denominated senior notes. Berkshire term debt of $800 million matured in February 2018 and $750 million will mature in August 2018. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. During 2017, BHE’s and BNSF’s capital expenditures were $4.6 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. We forecast capital expenditures of these two operations will approximate $9.7 billion in 2018. BNSF’s outstanding debt approximated $22.5 billion as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $455 million since December 31, 2016. In March 2017, BNSF issued $1.25 billion of senior unsecured debentures with $500 million due in 2027 and $750 million due in 2047. BNSF debentures of $650 million par amount will mature in March 2018. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were approximately $39.7 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.6 billion since December 31, 2016. During 2017, BHE and its subsidiaries issued approximately $1.9 billion of debt with maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2057. In January 2018, BHE issued senior unsecured debt of $2.2 billion with maturities ranging from 2021 to 2048. The proceeds from these borrowings were used to repay certain short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. Within the next twelve months, approximately $3.4 billion of BHE and subsidiary term debt will mature. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. Finance and financial products assets were approximately $41.9 billion as of December 31, 2017, a decrease of $175 million from December 31, 2016. Finance assets consist primarily of loans and finance receivables, various types of property held for lease, cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills. Finance and financial products liabilities declined $3.0 billion to approximately $16.7 billion as of December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in borrowings of approximately $2.3 billion, reflecting repayments of $3.6 billion, partly offset by $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in January by a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). The new BHFC notes mature in 2019 and 2020. BHFC’s outstanding borrowings were $12.9 billion at December 31, 2017. In January 2018, $600 million par amount of BHFC senior notes matured and an additional $4.0 billion will mature over the remainder of 2018. BHFC’s senior note borrowings are used to fund loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and a portion of assets held for lease by our UTLX railcar leasing business. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes. Berkshire’s Board of Directors has authorized Berkshire management to repurchase, at its discretion, Berkshire Class A and Class B common stock at prices no higher than a 20% premium over book value per share. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20 billion. There is no obligation to repurchase any stock and the program is expected to continue indefinitely. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. There were no share repurchases in 2017. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as minimum rentals under operating leases and certain purchase obligations, and are not currently reflected in our financial statements. These obligations will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. K-52 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Contractual Obligations (Continued) The timing and/or amount of the payments under certain contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Most significantly, the timing and amount of future payments of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts, including retroactive reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of claim settlement activities or events. Obligations arising under life, annuity and health insurance benefits are also contingent on future premiums, allowances, mortality, morbidity, expenses and policy lapse rates. The amounts included in the following table are based on the liability estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017. Although certain insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and life, annuity and health benefits are recoverable under reinsurance contracts, those receivables are not reflected in the table. A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 follows (in millions). Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table. Estimated payments due by period Total 2018 2019-2020 2021-2022 After 2022 Notes payable and other borrowings, including interest $ 151,777 $ 21,736 $ 19,099 $ 15,707 $ 95,235 Operating leases 8,486 1,330 2,259 1,581 3,316 Purchase obligations (1) 39,957 12,959 6,940 5,018 15,040 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (2) 104,059 20,614 21,377 14,740 47,328 Life, annuity and health insurance benefits (3) 33,095 1,196 (29) 293 31,635 Other 16,899 3,328 813 2,344 10,414 Total $ 354,273 $ 61,163 $ 50,459 $ 39,683 $ 202,968 (1) Primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. (2) Includes unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under retroactive reinsurance contracts. (3) Amounts represent estimated undiscounted benefits, net of estimated future premiums, as applicable. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Property and casualty losses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities and all techniques require significant judgments and assumptions. As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include provisions for reported claims, as well as claims not yet reported and the development of reported claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails. Our consolidated claim liabilities as of December 31, 2017 were $104 billion, of which 87% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (General Re Group and NICO Group). Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques of these businesses follows. K-53 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December 31, 2017, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses were $18.1 billion. Claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable were $17.2 billion. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies. Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2017, case development liabilities averaged approximately 30% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities. For incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims, liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2016 increased $517 million during 2017, which produced a corresponding decrease to pre-tax earnings. We modified the assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2017 to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated. With respect to liabilities for BI claims, our most significant claim category, we believe it is reasonably possible that average severities will change by at least one percentage point from the severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2017. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $275 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through the NICO Group and the General Re Group. In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of premium and loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk), per occurrence excess or retroactive reinsurance contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract if reinsurer personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. However, loss information is often less detailed with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts. Additionally, loss information we receive through periodic reports is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers. Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. Periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies. In the U.S., such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period. Outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. In some instances, reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks thereby creating multiple contractual parties between us and the primary insured, potentially compounding the claim reporting delays. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage, and for other reasons. K-54 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) (Continued) As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. When received, we review the information for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s books and records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2017 follows (in millions). General Re Group NICO Group Total Property Casualty Total Property Casualty Total Property Casualty Total Reported case liabilities $ 1,488 $ 6,608 $ 8,096 $ 3,477 $ 2,833 $ 6,310 $ 4,965 $ 9,441 $ 14,406 IBNR liabilities 1,622 6,630 8,252 2,574 4,487 7,061 4,196 11,117 15,313 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 3,110 13,238 16,348 6,051 7,320 13,371 9,161 20,558 29,719 Reinsurance recoverable 256 610 866 33 418 451 289 1,028 1,317 Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 2,854 $ 12,628 $ 15,482 $ 6,018 $ 6,902 $ 12,920 $ 8,872 $ 19,530 $ 28,402 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses in the table above consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. With respect to the General Re Group, we use a variety of actuarial methodologies to establish unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. Certain methodologies, such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, are utilized, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate. The critical processes involved in estimating unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include the establishment of case liability estimates, the determination of expected loss ratios and loss reporting patterns, which drive IBNR liability estimates, and the comparison of reported activity to the expected loss reporting patterns. General Re Group’s process for estimating unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses starts with case loss estimates reported by ceding companies. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. As of December 31, 2017, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $2.2 billion, which were concentrated in legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates. In estimating General Re Group’s IBNR liabilities, we consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. In this process, we classify all loss and premium data into groups or portfolios of policies based primarily on product type (e.g., treaty, facultative and program), line of business (e.g., auto liability, property and workers’ compensation) and/or geographic jurisdiction, and in some cases contractual features or market segment. For each portfolio, we aggregate premiums and losses by accident year or coverage period and analyze the paid and incurred loss data over time. We estimate the expected development of reported claims, which, together with the expected loss ratios, are used to calculate IBNR liability estimates. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns. For the NICO Group, we generally also establish reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis determined from reported case loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimates. Liabilities are subsequently adjusted over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which are used to form judgments on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of the impact of major catastrophe events as they become known. K-55 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) (Continued) Certain catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. In the aggregate, we reduced net losses for prior years’ occurrences by $295 million in 2017, which produced a corresponding increase in pre-tax earnings. Reported claims for prior years’ property loss events were less than anticipated and we reduced our estimated ultimate liabilities by $152 million. However, property losses incurred during any given period may be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophe and large individual property loss events. In 2017, reported nominal losses for prior years’ workers’ compensation claims of the General Re Group were less than expected. After reevaluating expected remaining IBNR estimates, we reduced our liabilities by $160 million. An increase of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in workers’ compensation IBNR liabilities of approximately $1 billion, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. We reduced General Re Group’s other casualty, excluding asbestos and environmental, estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ events by $114 million in 2017 reflecting lower than expected reported losses, resulting in a $114 million increase in pre-tax earnings. For our significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that an increase of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and a five percent increase in expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million. While we believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates, more likely outcomes are less than $900 million given the diversification in worldwide business. Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as for asbestos, environmental and latent injury liability estimates. Our combined net liabilities for such losses at December 31, 2017, were approximately $1.6 billion, which included an increase in estimated ultimate losses of approximately $145 million during 2017, which produced a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment, and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider “survival ratios”, which is the average net claim payments in recent years in relation to net unpaid losses, as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. Our survival ratio was approximately 15 years as of December 31, 2017. Retroactive reinsurance Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities relating to our retroactive reinsurance contracts are predominately related to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-tails to be very long. Our gross unpaid losses, deferred charge assets, and net liabilities at December 31, 2017 were as follows (in millions). Gross unpaid losses Deferred charges Liabilities, net ofdeferred charges December 31, 2017 $42,937 $15,278 $27,659 Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications. We currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $57 billion due to the applicable aggregate contract limits. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our $42.9 billion estimated liability at December 31, 2017. We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expected results are revealed. K-56 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance (Continued) Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $14.0 billion at December 31, 2017. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect these claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities. Changes in ultimate estimated liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts were relatively insignificant in 2017, as were changes in the estimated timing and amount of remaining unpaid losses. In 2017, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of approximately $1.0 billion with respect to these contracts. In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums. We amortize deferred charge assets, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances and the amount of periodic amortization. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2017, we currently estimate that amortization expense in 2018 will approximate $1.2 billion. Derivative contract liabilities We measure derivative contract liabilities at fair value. Our remaining significant derivative contract exposures relate to equity index put option contracts written between 2004 and 2008. Our recorded liabilities are based on models as there are essentially no observable prices for comparable contracts. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by such models, as transaction values may also reflect the prevailing perceptions of individual buyers and sellers and other changes in market conditions. We determine the fair values of equity index put option contracts using a Black-Scholes based option valuation model. Inputs to the model include the current index value, strike price, interest rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted average interest and dividend rates used as of December 31, 2017 were 1.1% and 3.2%, respectively. The interest rates were approximately 40 basis points (on a weighted average basis) over benchmark interest rates at the end of 2017 and represented our estimate of our nonperformance risk. The Black-Scholes based model also incorporates volatility inputs that estimate potential price changes over time. Our contracts have an average remaining maturity of about three years. The weighted average volatility used as of December 31, 2017 was approximately 17.4%. We determine the weighted average volatilities based on the volatility input for each contract weighted by the contract’s notional value. The potential impact from changes in our volatility assumptions are as follows. (Dollars in millions).

We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2017. Our review includes determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then, as required by GAAP, we estimate the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied goodwill value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Equity Price Risk Equity securities represent a significant portion of our investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2017, approximately 65% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in five issuers. We often hold our equity investments for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. We strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, fair values of these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contracts. The following table summarizes our equity securities and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio.

K-58 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Interest Rate Risk We may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We recognize and accept that credit losses may occur. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We strive to maintain high credit ratings, in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We rarely utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2017 and 2016. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, such as The Coca-Cola Company, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and do not use derivative contracts to hedge or manage foreign currency price changes in any meaningful way. Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and services subsidiaries. This translation related impact may be offset by gains or losses included in net earnings related to net liabilities of Berkshire and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies, due to changes in exchange rates. A summary of these gains (losses), after-tax, for each of the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2016 follows (in millions). 2017 2016 Euro-denominated debt included in net earnings $ (655) $ 159 Net liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts included in net earnings (295) 458 Foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income 2,151 (1,412) Commodity Price Risk Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We may utilize derivative contracts to manage a portion of commodity price risks at BHE. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page K-61.

1067983,BRK-B,BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC,2019,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (in millions). 2018 2017 2016 Insurance – underwriting $ 1,566 $ (2,219 ) $ 1,370 Insurance – investment income 4,554 3,887 3,636 Railroad 5,219 3,959 3,569 Utilities and energy 2,621 2,033 2,230 Manufacturing, service and retailing 9,364 7,282 6,803 Investment and derivative gains/losses (17,737 ) 1,377 6,497 Other (1,566 ) (485 ) (31 ) Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 — 29,106 — Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 4,021 $ 44,940 $ 24,074 Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 26 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Beginning in 2018, our periodic net earnings include changes in unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities. These gains and losses are likely to be very significant given the size of our current holdings and the inherent volatility in securities prices. Prior to 2018, the changes in unrealized gains and losses pertaining to such investments were recorded in other comprehensive income. The new accounting treatment has no effect on our consolidated shareholders’ equity. After-tax earnings of our business operations in 2018 were favorably affected by lower U.S. income tax expense, primarily attributable to a reduction in the statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The effect of the lower U.S. statutory income tax rate in 2018 on the comparative after-tax earnings of our various business operations varied, reflecting the differences in the mix of earnings subject to income tax, income tax credits and the effects of state and local income taxes. Net earnings in 2017 included approximately $29.1 billion attributable to a one-time net benefit from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) on December 22, 2017. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This benefit included approximately $29.6 billion related to a one-time non-cash reduction of net deferred income tax liabilities from the reduction in the statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and a net benefit of approximately $900 million primarily attributable to our earnings from Kraft Heinz, partly offset by a one-time income tax expense of approximately $1.4 billion on the deemed repatriation of certain accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Due to their significance, we presented these one-time effects as a distinct item in the preceding table. Accordingly, the after-tax figures presented for 2017 in the discussion of our various operating businesses and other activities exclude the one-time effects of the TCJA. After-tax earnings from insurance underwriting were approximately $1.6 billion in 2018 compared to after-tax losses of approximately $2.2 billion in 2017. Results in 2018 included reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ property/casualty loss events, gains from foreign currency exchange rate changes on certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of U.S subsidiaries of $207 million and a lower effective income tax rate, partly offset by losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $1.6 billion ($1.3 billion after-tax). After-tax losses from insurance underwriting in 2017 included estimated pre-tax losses of approximately $3.0 billion ($1.95 billion after-tax) from significant catastrophe events. Underwriting results in 2017 also included after-tax foreign currency exchange rate losses of $295 million. Our railroad business generated a 31.8% increase in after-tax earnings in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting an increase in unit volume, higher average revenue per car/unit and a lower effective income tax rate, partly offset by increased fuel and other operating costs. After-tax earnings of our railroad business in 2017 were $4.0 billion, an increase of 10.9% compared to 2016, reflecting increased unit volume. Our utilities and energy businesses produced higher after-tax earnings in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to a lower overall effective income tax rate and the effects of losses incurred in 2017 in connection with the prepayment of certain long-term debt, partially offset by lower pre-tax earnings in certain of the regulated utilities. After-tax earnings of our utility and energy businesses in 2017 declined $197 million compared to 2016, reflecting the debt prepayment losses in 2017. K-32 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Results of Operations (Continued) After-tax earnings in 2018 of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 29% over 2017, due to lower effective income tax rates and a 13% increase in pre-tax earnings. After-tax earnings in 2017 of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses were $7.3 billion, an increase of 7.0% compared to 2016, reflecting comparatively higher earnings from several of our larger operations and the impact of businesses acquired in 2016 and 2017. After-tax losses from investments and derivative contracts were $17.7 billion in 2018, which included after-tax losses of approximately $18 billion from changes in market values of our investments in equity securities held at December 31, 2018. Prior to 2018, after-tax investment gains or losses on equity securities arose from the sale of securities during the period based on the cost of the disposed security or through the recording of other-than-temporary impairment losses. In 2017, we recorded after-tax unrealized gains on our investments in equity securities of approximately $19 billion in other comprehensive income. After-tax investment and derivative gains were approximately $1.4 billion in 2017 and $6.5 billion in 2016. Investment gains in 2016 included approximately $2.7 billion from the redemptions of our Wrigley and Kraft Heinz preferred stock investments, and sales of Dow Chemical common stock we received in the conversion of the Dow Chemical preferred stock investment. Investment gains in 2016 also included a non-cash after-tax gain of approximately $1.9 billion related to the exchange of Procter & Gamble (“P&G”) common stock for 100% of the common stock of Duracell. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Other earnings included after-tax foreign currency exchange rate gains of $289 million in 2018, losses of $655 million in 2017 and gains of $159 million in 2016 related to parent company Euro-denominated debt. In addition, other earnings in 2018 included losses from equity method investments due to Kraft Heinz, partly offset by earnings from other equity method investments. Other earnings in 2018 also reflected increased interest income from short-term investments. Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as a component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating, based on our long-held philosophy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods. Accordingly, we believe that such gains and losses are not necessarily meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance operations. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider catastrophe losses in excess of $100 million (pre-tax) from a current year event as significant. We incurred estimated pre-tax losses of approximately $1.6 billion in 2018 and $3.0 billion in 2017 from significant catastrophe events. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $110 billion as of December 31, 2018. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. K-33 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). 2018 2017 2016 Underwriting gain (loss): GEICO $ 2,449 $ (310 ) $ 462 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (1,109) (3,648 ) 1,012 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 670 719 657 Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 2,010 (3,239 ) 2,131 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 444 (1,020 ) 761 Net underwriting gain (loss) $ 1,566 $ (2,219 ) $ 1,370 Effective income tax rate 21.4% 32.0% 34.8% GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2018 2017 2016 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 34,123 $ 30,547 $ 26,309 Premiums earned $ 33,363 100.0 $ 29,441 100.0 $ 25,483 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 26,278 78.8 25,497 86.6 21,044 82.6 Underwriting expenses 4,636 13.9 4,254 14.5 3,977 15.6 Total losses and expenses 30,914 92.7 29,751 101.1 25,021 98.2 Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) $ 2,449 $ (310 ) $ 462 Premiums written were $34.1 billion in 2018, an increase of 11.7% compared to 2017. The increase reflected voluntary auto policies-in-force growth of 3.3% and increased premiums per auto policy of approximately 6.4%. The increase in premiums per policy was attributable to rate increases, coverage changes and changes in state and risk mix. The rate increases were in response to accelerating claim costs in recent years. Although policies-in-force increased 540,000 during 2018, the rate of increase slowed, as voluntary auto new business sales decreased 4.7% compared to 2017. Pre-tax underwriting gains in 2018 were $2,449 million compared to losses of $310 million in 2017. Underwriting results in 2018 reflected the effects of lower losses from significant catastrophe events and from prior years’ loss events, as well as increased average premiums per policy. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were $26.3 billion in 2018, an increase of $781 million (3.1%) compared to 2017. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) for 2018 was 78.8%, a decline of 7.8 percentage points compared to 2017. Losses from significant catastrophe events were $105 million in 2018 (Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California) and approximately $450 million in 2017 (Hurricanes Harvey and Irma). Losses and loss adjustment expenses regularly include gains or losses for the decreases or increases in the ultimate claim loss estimates during the period for prior years’ loss events. These gains or losses produce corresponding increases or decreases to pre-tax underwriting gains. GEICO’s losses and loss adjustment expenses included gains of $222 million in 2018 and losses of $517 million in 2017 with respect to prior years’ loss events. In addition, claims frequencies in 2018 for property damage, collision, and bodily and personal injury protection coverages declined (two to four percent range) compared to 2017. Average claims severities in 2018 increased for property damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range) and bodily injury coverage (five to seven percent range) versus 2017. K-34 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Underwriting expenses were approximately $4.6 billion in 2018, an increase of $382 million (9.0%) over 2017. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in 2018 was 13.9%, a decrease of 0.6 percentage points compared to 2017. The underwriting expense increase was primarily attributable to increases in advertising expenses, insurance premium taxes and employee-related costs, which reflected wage and staffing increases. Premiums written were $30.5 billion in 2017, an increase of 16.1% over 2016, and premiums earned were $29.4 billion, an increase of approximately $4.0 billion (15.5%). During 2017, our voluntary auto policies-in-force grew approximately 8.6% and premiums per auto policy increased 6.9%. The increase in average premiums per policy was attributable to rate increases, coverage changes and changes in state and risk mix. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2017 increased 10.5% compared to 2016. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 1,276,000 during 2017. Pre-tax underwriting losses in 2017 were $310 million compared to pre-tax gains of $462 million in 2016. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2017 increased approximately $4.5 billion (21.2%) compared to 2016. Our loss ratio in 2017 increased 4.0 percentage points compared to 2016. The increase in losses incurred was attributable to increased average claims severities, losses from significant catastrophe events in 2017 ($450 million) and losses with respect to prior years’ loss events ($517 million). Average claims severities were higher in 2017 for property damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range) and bodily injury coverage (five to seven percent range). Claims frequencies in 2017 were relatively unchanged compared to 2016 for bodily injury coverage, decreased about one percent for property damage and collision coverages and decreased about two to three percent for personal injury protection coverage. Underwriting expenses increased $277 million (7.0%) in 2017 compared to 2016. Our expense ratio in 2017 declined 1.1 percentage points compared to 2016. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”) and General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and General Re Life Corporation (collectively, “General Re”). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN. With the exception of our retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses, we strive to generate pre-tax underwriting profits. Time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges.

These increases were primarily attributable to higher direct and broker markets business, derived primarily from new business and increased participations for renewal business in both property and casualty lines. Premiums earned included approximately $1.8 billion in both 2018 and 2017 and $1.7 billion in 2016 from a 10-year, 20% quota-share contract entered into by NICO with Insurance Australia Group Limited, which expires in 2025. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2018 decreased $288 million (4.0%) compared to 2017, and the loss ratio declined 18 percentage points to 77.6%. Losses incurred from significant catastrophe events in 2018 were approximately $1.3 billion, which derived from Hurricanes Florence and Michael, Typhoon Jebi and the wildfires in California, including $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Losses from significant catastrophe events in 2017 were approximately $2.4 billion, which derived from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, an earthquake in Mexico, a cyclone in Australia and wildfires in California. There were no significant catastrophe loss events in 2016. In addition, losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected net gains of $469 million in 2018, $295 million in 2017 and $874 million in 2016 from reductions of estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ events. The net gain in 2018 was primarily due to lower than expected property losses. The net gain from prior years’ loss events in 2017 reflected losses from higher than expected property claims and increases in certain United Kingdom (“U.K.”) claim liabilities attributable to the U.K. Ministry of Justice’s decision to reduce the fixed discount rate required in lump sum settlement calculations of personal injury claims from 2.5% to negative 0.75%. Retroactive reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance premiums earned in 2018 were $517 million, which derived primarily from one contract. Premiums earned in 2017 included $10.2 billion from an aggregate excess-of-loss retroactive reinsurance agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (the “AIG Agreement”). At the inception of our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we record the estimated ultimate claim liabilities, and we also record the excess of such claim liabilities over the premiums received as a deferred charge asset. Thus, as of the inception dates of these contracts, there is no net underwriting gain or loss. Deferred charge assets are subsequently amortized over the expected claim settlement period as losses and loss adjustment expenses. Pre-tax underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance contracts were $778 million in 2018, $1,330 million in 2017 and $60 million in 2016. Certain retroactive reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies. Pre-tax underwriting results included gains of $169 million in 2018, losses of $264 million in 2017 and gains of $392 million in 2016 associated with the re-measurement of such liabilities due to currency exchange rate changes. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $947 million in 2018, $1,066 million in 2017 and $452 million in 2016, which derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amount of future claim payments. Pre-tax underwriting losses related to the AIG Agreement were $611 million in 2018 and $527 million in 2017. In 2018, we decreased estimated ultimate liabilities $341 million for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts, which after adjustments to the related unamortized deferred charges from changes in the estimated timing and amount of the future claim payments, produced pre-tax underwriting gains of approximately $185 million. Changes in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ contracts had a relatively insignificant effect on pre-tax underwriting results in 2017 and 2016. K-36 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance (Continued) Unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $41.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and $42.9 billion at December 31, 2017. Deferred charge assets related to such contracts were approximately $14.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and $15.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Deferred charge assets will be charged to pre-tax earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization. Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2018 2017 2016 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 5,446 $ 4,846 $ 4,588 Premiums earned $ 5,343 100.0 $ 4,808 100.0 $ 4,587 100.0 Life and health insurance benefits 4,226 79.1 4,276 88.9 3,644 79.4 Underwriting expenses 901 16.9 584 12.2 638 13.9 Total benefits and expenses 5,127 96.0 4,860 101.1 4,282 93.3 Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) $ 216 $ (52 ) $ 305 Life/health premiums earned were $5.3 billion, an increase of $535 million (11.1%) over 2017, which increased $221 million (4.8%) compared to 2016. The increases in each year were primarily attributable to growth in the North America, Asia and Australia life insurance markets. In each of the last three years, premiums earned of approximately $1.0 billion derived from a BHLN reinsurance contract with a major reinsurer covering predominantly life risks in North America. Our life/health business produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $216 million in 2018, losses of $52 million in 2017 and gains of $305 million in 2016. The underwriting gains in 2018 reflected lower losses from the run-off of U.S. long-term care business, partially offset by lower gains from the run-off of variable annuity guarantee contracts. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded pre-tax losses of $450 million from discount rate reductions and changes in other actuarial assumptions associated with long-term care liabilities. Pre-tax gains from variable annuity guarantee reinsurance were $34 million in 2018, $256 million in 2017 and $231 million in 2016. Underwriting results from this business reflect changes in estimated liabilities for guaranteed benefits, which result from changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned in 2018 were $1,156 million, an increase of $258 million (28.7%) compared to 2017, which declined $184 million (17.0%) from 2016, reflecting a corresponding increase and decrease in new business volumes. Periodic payment business is price sensitive, and the volume we write can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, and the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts produced pre-tax losses of $340 million in 2018, $671 million in 2017 and $128 million in 2016. Certain contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies and pre-tax underwriting results included gains of $93 million in 2018, losses of $190 million in 2017 and gains of $313 million in 2016 from the re-measurement of such liabilities due to changes in exchange rates. Before foreign currency gains and losses, pre-tax underwriting losses were $433 million in 2018, $481 million in 2017 and $441 million in 2016. These losses primarily derived from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities, as well as the impact of mortality and interest rate changes. Discounted annuity liabilities approximated $12.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and $11.2 billion at December 31, 2017, reflecting a weighted average discount rate of approximately 4.1%. K-37 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers are Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), and National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company, Applied Underwriters, Central States Indemnity Company and MLMIC Insurance Company, acquired October 1, 2018. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2018 2017 2016 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 8,561 $ 7,483 $ 6,684 Premiums earned $ 8,111 100.0 $ 7,143 100.0 $ 6,257 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 5,261 64.9 4,511 63.1 3,864 61.8 Underwriting expenses 2,180 26.9 1,913 26.8 1,736 27.7 Total losses and expenses 7,441 91.8 6,424 89.9 5,600 89.5 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 670 $ 719 $ 657 Premiums written and earned in 2018 increased 14.4% and 13.6%, respectively, compared to 2017. The increases in premiums written and earned were primarily attributable to written premium growth at BH Specialty (32.5%), GUARD (19.4%), NICO Primary (14.0%) and BHHC (7.6%). Premiums written and earned in 2017 increased 12.0% and 14.2%, respectively, compared to 2016 reflecting written premium increases from all of the significant BH Primary insurers, led by GUARD (26%), BH Specialty (23%) and BHHC (9%). BH Primary’s loss ratios were 64.9% in 2018, 63.1% in 2017, and 61.8% in 2016. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included losses from significant catastrophe events of $190 million in 2018 from Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California and $225 million in 2017 from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included net gains from the reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $715 million in 2018, $766 million in 2017 and $503 million in 2016. The liability reductions in each year primarily related to healthcare malpractice and workers’ compensation business. BH Primary writes significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to higher severity and longer claim-tails, which could give rise to significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher than expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). 2018 2017 2016 Interest and other investment income $ 1,851 $ 1,263 $ 930 Dividend income 3,652 3,592 3,552 Investment income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 5,503 4,855 4,482 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 949 968 846 Net investment income $ 4,554 $ 3,887 $ 3,636 Effective income tax rate 17.2% 19.9% 18.8% K-38 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Pre-tax interest and other investment income increased $588 million (46.6%) compared to 2017. The increase reflected the effect of higher short-term interest rates in 2018 and higher other investment income, partly offset by lower interest from lower average investments in fixed maturity securities. Our invested assets continue to include significant levels of short-term investments. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to such investments. Dividend income increased $60 million (1.7%) in 2018 as compared to 2017, reflecting the impact of increased investments in marketable equity securities and higher dividend rates, partially offset by Restaurant Brands International’s redemption of our $3 billion investment in 9% preferred stock in December 2017. Pre-tax investment income increased $373 million (8.3%) in 2017 compared to 2016, attributable to higher interest rates on short-term investments and increased other investment income. Dividend income in 2017 was relatively unchanged compared to 2016 reflecting increased dividend rates and increased overall investment levels, offset by the impact of the conversion of our $3 billion investment in Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) 8.5% preferred stock into Dow common stock at the end of 2016. Prior to its conversion, we received dividends of $255 million per annum. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, less insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $123 billion at December 31, 2018, $114 billion at December 31, 2017, and $91 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase in float in 2018 reflected the effects of the acquisition of MLMIC and overall growth of our insurance operations. The significant increase in float in 2017 reflected increases in loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities (net of deferred charges) assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts written in 2017 and estimated liabilities related to catastrophe events, and overall growth of our insurance operations. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $2.0 billion in 2018, and consequently, the average cost of float for the period was negative. Pre-tax underwriting losses were approximately $3.2 billion in 2017 and our average cost of float was approximately 3.0%.

K-39 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major business groups by type of product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions). 2018 2017 2016 Revenues $ 23,855 $ 21,387 $ 19,829 Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 5,394 5,023 4,809 Fuel 3,346 2,518 1,934 Purchased services 2,870 2,514 2,418 Depreciation and amortization 2,317 2,352 2,128 Equipment rents, materials and other 2,024 1,636 1,855 Total operating expenses 15,951 14,043 13,144 Interest expense 1,041 1,016 992 16,992 15,059 14,136 Pre-tax earnings 6,863 6,328 5,693 Income taxes 1,644 2,369 2,124 Net earnings $ 5,219 $ 3,959 $ 3,569 Effective income tax rate 24.0% 37.4% 37.3% 2018 versus 2017 BNSF’s revenues were $23.9 billion in 2018, representing an increase of $2.5 billion (11.5%) versus 2017. BNSF’s revenues in 2018 reflected a 6.2% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit and a 4.1% increase in volume. Combined volume was 10.7 million cars/units compared to 10.3 million in 2017. The increase in average revenue per car/unit was attributable to increased rates per car/unit, higher fuel surcharge revenue driven by higher fuel prices, and business mix changes. Pre-tax earnings were approximately $6.9 billion in 2018, an increase of 8.5% compared to 2017. Revenues from consumer products were $7.9 billion in 2018, an increase of 11.1% compared to 2017, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit and volume increases of 2.9%. The volume increases were due to higher domestic intermodal volumes, primarily attributable to general economic growth and tight truck capacity leading to conversion from highway to rail, as well as growth in imports and containerized agricultural product exports, partially offset by a sizable contract loss. Revenues from industrial products were $6.0 billion in 2018, an increase of 16.2% from 2017. The increase was attributable to volume increases of 9.8% as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes in 2018 were higher primarily due to strength in the industrial and energy sectors, which drove higher demand for petroleum products, building products, construction products, and plastics. Revenues from agricultural products increased 8.8% in 2018 to $4.7 billion compared to 2017. The increase was due to higher volumes of 9.0%, partially offset by slightly lower average revenue per car/unit. Volumes increased due to strong export and domestic corn shipments, as well as higher fertilizer and other grain products volumes, partially offset by a reduction in soybean and wheat exports. Revenues from coal in 2018 increased 4.3% to $4.0 billion compared to 2017, attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by lower volumes of 0.8%. The volume decreases in 2018 were due mainly to utility plant retirements combined with competition from natural gas and renewables, mostly offset by market share gains and improved export volumes. Total operating expenses were $16.0 billion in 2018, an increase of $1.9 billion (13.6%) compared to 2017. Our ratio of operating expenses to revenues increased 1.2 percentage points to 66.9% in 2018 versus 2017. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $371 million (7.4%) compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to wage inflation and increased headcount and associated training costs. Fuel expenses increased $828 million (32.9%) compared to 2017 primarily due to higher average fuel prices and increased volumes. K-40 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Purchased services expense increased $356 million (14.2%) compared to 2017. The increase was due to higher purchased transportation costs of our logistics services business, as well as increased intermodal ramping, drayage, and other volume-related costs. Equipment rents, materials and other expense increased $388 million (23.7%) compared to 2017. The increase resulted from higher locomotive material, personal injury expenses, derailment-related costs, and property taxes, as well as a benefit of the enactment of the TCJA on an equity method investee in 2017. BNSF’s effective income tax rate was 24.0% for 2018 as compared to 37.4% for 2017 which excludes the effects of the TCJA. The reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate under the TCJA, effective January 1, 2018, drove most of the effective income tax rate decrease. 2017 versus 2016 BNSF’s revenues were $21.4 billion in 2017, representing an increase of $1.6 billion (7.9%) versus 2016. Pre-tax earnings increased 11.2% in 2017 compared to 2016. During 2017, BNSF’s revenues reflected a 2.4% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit and a 5.3% increase in volume. Combined volume was 10.3 million cars/units in 2017 compared to 9.8 million in 2016. The increase in average revenue per car/unit was primarily attributable to higher fuel surcharge revenue, increased rates per car/unit and business mix changes. Revenues from consumer products were $7.1 billion in 2017, representing an increase of 8.8% compared to 2016, reflecting volume increases of 6.3% as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increases were primarily attributable to improving economic conditions, normalizing of retail inventories, new services and higher market share, which benefited domestic intermodal, international intermodal and automotive volumes. Revenues from industrial products were $5.1 billion in 2017, an increase of 7.7% from 2016, attributable to a volume increase of 5.0% as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes in 2017 were higher for sand and other commodities that support drilling. In addition, broad strengthening in the industrial sector drove greater demand for steel and taconite. These volume increases were partially offset by lower petroleum products volume due to pipeline displacement of U.S. crude rail traffic. Revenues from agricultural products increased 1.8% to $4.3 billion in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes were relatively flat, primarily due to higher shipments of domestic grain, ethanol and other grain products, offset by lower grain exports. Revenues from coal increased 13.7% to $3.8 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. This increase reflected higher average revenue per car/unit as well as 6.3% higher volumes. The volume increases in 2017 were due to the effects of higher natural gas prices, which led to increased utility coal usage. This was partially offset by the effects of unit retirements at coal generating facilities, increased renewable generation and coal inventory adjustments at customer facilities. Total operating expenses were $14.0 billion in 2017, an increase of $899 million (6.8%) compared to 2016. Our ratio of operating expenses to revenues decreased 0.6 percentage points to 65.7% in 2017 versus 2016. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $214 million (4.4%) compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher health and welfare costs and volume-related increases, partially offset by lower headcount. Fuel expenses increased $584 million (30.2%) compared to 2016 primarily due to higher average fuel prices and increased volumes. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $224 million (10.5%) compared to 2016 due to a larger base of depreciable assets in service. Equipment rents, materials and other expense declined $219 million (11.8%) compared to 2016. These declines resulted from the impact of the enactment of the TCJA on an equity method investee, as well as lower personal injury and casualty costs. Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) We currently own 90.9% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects. In addition, BHE also operates the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. K-41 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based, in large part, on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent these regulated operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. Among its provisions, the TCJA reduced the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of our domestic regulated utilities from 35% to 21%. In 2018, BHE’s regulated subsidiaries began passing the benefits of lower income tax expense attributable to the TCJA to customers through various regulatory mechanisms, including lower rates, higher depreciation and reductions to rate base, which produced lower revenue and pre-tax earnings in 2018. Revenues and earnings of BHE are summarized below (dollars in millions).

Revenues in 2018 decreased 4% compared to 2017. Retail revenues in 2018 decreased $197 million compared to 2017. The decline reflected the effects of lower average rates ($180 million, including the impact of the TCJA of $152 million), and a reduction in volumes (0.2%), largely attributable to the impacts of weather. Pre-tax earnings decreased $386 million (34%) in 2018 as compared to 2017. Utility margin (operating revenues less cost of fuel and energy) in 2018 was $3,269 million, a decrease of $198 million (6%) versus 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the declines in revenues, which included the effects of the TCJA. In addition, pre-tax earnings were negatively impacted $174 million (offset in income tax expense) due to a state regulatory order that accelerated depreciation expense on certain thermal generation facilities. PacifiCorp’s after-tax earnings in 2018 were $739 million, a decrease of $24 million (3%) from 2017. Revenues increased 1% in 2017 compared to 2016. Wholesale and other revenues increased, reflecting higher volumes and average rates, and retail revenues decreased slightly, attributable to lower average rates, partly offset by higher volumes. Pre-tax earnings increased $26 million (2%) in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in earnings reflected higher utility margin, lower operations and maintenance expenses, and increased depreciation and amortization attributable to additional plant in-service. PacifiCorp’s after-tax earnings in 2017 were $763 million, a decrease of $1 million from 2016. K-42 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) MidAmerican Energy Company MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. Revenues in 2018 increased $211 million (7%) compared to 2017. Electric operating revenues increased $175 million (8%) and natural gas revenues increased $35 million (5%) in 2018 versus 2017. The increase in electric revenues was primarily attributable to higher retail revenues of $102 million, reflecting higher recoveries through bill riders (substantially offset in cost of sales, operating expenses and income tax expense) and volumes, partially offset by lower average rates, predominantly from the impact of the TCJA, and higher wholesale and other revenues of $73 million from higher volumes and average prices. The increase in natural gas revenues was primarily due to increased volumes, partially offset by a lower average per-unit price and the effects of the TCJA. Pre-tax earnings in 2018 increased $35 million (9%) compared to 2017. Electric utility margin in 2018 was $1,796 million, an increase of $122 million (7%) over 2017, which was primarily due to the net increase in retail revenues. However, the increase in electric utility margin was mostly offset by increased depreciation, maintenance and other operating expenses. The increase in depreciation expense included $65 million from additional wind generation and other plant placed in-service and $44 million from Iowa revenue sharing. MEC’s after-tax earnings in 2018 and 2017 were $669 million and $584 million, respectively, increases of $85 million (15%) and $52 million (10%), respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. MEC’s after-tax earnings were significantly greater than pre-tax earnings, primarily due to production income tax credits received relating to wind-powered generating facilities. Revenues increased $238 million (9%) in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher electric operating revenues ($123 million) and increased natural gas operating revenues ($82 million). Retail electric revenues increased $84 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily attributable to higher recoveries through bill riders and from non-weather usage and growth and rate factors, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of milder temperatures in 2017. Wholesale electric and other revenues increased $39 million in 2017 versus 2016, attributable to comparative increases in volumes, average rates and transmission fees. The natural gas operating revenues increase was primarily due to higher average per-unit costs of gas sold, which was offset by an increase in cost of sales. Pre-tax earnings declined $20 million (5%) in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting increased depreciation, maintenance and other operating expenses and interest expense and debt extinguishment costs, partially offset by comparative increases in electric utility margins of $76 million. NV Energy NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. Revenues in 2018 increased 1% compared to 2017. Electric operating revenues increased $17 million in 2018, reflecting increased pass-through cost adjustments and higher volumes largely attributable to the impacts of weather and retail customer growth, partly offset by reductions from the impact of the TCJA and lower retail rates resulting from a 2017 regulatory rate review. Natural gas operating revenue increased $5 million in 2018, primarily due to a higher average per-unit price, partially offset by lower customer usage. Pre-tax earnings in 2018 decreased $150 million (26%) compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower electric utility margin and increased depreciation, maintenance and other operating costs. Electric utility margin in 2018 was $1,696 million, representing a $52 million (3%) decrease versus 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the effects of the TCJA, partially offset by the higher sales volumes. NV Energy’s after-tax earnings in 2018 were $317 million, a decline of 13% from 2017. Revenues increased $123 million (4%) in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was due primarily to an increase in retail electric operating revenues, which included a combination of increased rates from pass-through cost adjustments and higher volumes, partly offset by lower revenues from energy efficiency programs (offset by lower operating expenses). NV Energy also experienced retail electric revenue declines from the transition of certain commercial and industrial customers electing to purchase power from alternative sources and thus becoming distribution service only customers. Natural gas operating revenue declined $11 million in 2017, primarily due to lower rates, partially offset by higher customer usage. Pre-tax earnings increased $8 million (1%) in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower interest expenses. NV Energy’s after-tax earnings in 2017 were $365 million, an increase of 2% from 2016. K-43 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) Northern Powergrid Revenues increased $71 million (7%) in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the favorable foreign currency translation effects of a weaker average U.S. Dollar in 2018 and increased smart meter and distribution revenues. Pre-tax earnings in 2018 decreased $7 million (2%) compared to 2017, primarily due to higher depreciation and other operating expenses, including higher pension settlement losses, partly offset by favorable foreign currency translation effects and the increases in revenues. Revenues declined $47 million (5%) in 2017 compared to 2016. Foreign currency translation effects of a comparatively stronger average U.S. Dollar in 2017 resulted in a $48 million comparative decline in revenues. In addition, we experienced comparative declines in distribution revenues, which were substantially offset by higher smart metering revenue. Pre-tax earnings declined $56 million (15%) in 2017 compared to 2016. The decline was primarily due to foreign currency translation effects, as well as from increased pension expenses and lower distribution revenues, partially offset by lower asset impairment charges and lower distribution costs. Natural gas pipelines Revenues increased $217 million (22%) in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to higher transportation revenues of $113 million from higher volumes and rates due to unique market opportunities and colder average temperatures and increased sales volumes ($99 million) related to system balancing activities (substantially offset in cost of sales). Pre-tax earnings increased $61 million (14%) in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the increases in transportation revenues and lower depreciation expense, partly offset by comparative increases in operations and maintenance expenses. Revenues increased $23 million (2%) in 2017 compared to 2016. Northern Natural Gas produced higher transportation revenues and higher gas sales, primarily from system balancing activities, which were partly offset by lower transportation revenues at Kern River. Pre-tax earnings increased $33 million (8%) in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to the increase in transportation revenues and a reduction in expenses and regulatory liabilities related to the impact of an alternative rate structure approved by Kern River’s regulators in the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Other energy businesses Revenues in 2018 increased $43 million (2%) compared to 2017, reflecting a comparative increase from renewable energy. Pre-tax earnings in 2018 were unchanged from 2017 as the increased revenues from renewable energy were offset by increased depreciation expense and higher other operating expenses. Revenues increased 4% in 2017 compared to 2016. AltaLink L.P.’s operating revenues increased $197 million (39%) in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to effects of a decision in 2016 by its regulator, which changed the timing of when construction-in-progress expenditures included in the rate base are billable to customers and earned in revenues. The decision resulted in a one-time net reduction in revenue in 2016, with offsetting reductions in expenses. In 2017, we also experienced a comparative revenue increase of 13% from renewable energy and a comparative decline of 12% from the unregulated retail services business. Pre-tax earnings in 2017 increased 5% compared to 2016, as increased earnings from renewable energy and AltaLink L.P. were partly offset by lower earnings from the unregulated retail services business and other energy ventures. Real estate brokerage Revenues in 2018 increased 22% as compared to 2017, primarily due to recent business acquisitions. Pre-tax earnings decreased $16 million in 2018 compared to 2017, as higher operating costs and interest expense more than offset the revenue increase. Revenues increased 23% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to business acquisitions and an increase in average home sales prices. Pre-tax earnings decreased 2% in 2017 as compared to 2016. Earnings in 2017 included increased earnings from franchise businesses, partially offset by lower earnings from brokerage businesses, primarily due to higher operating expenses. Corporate interest and income taxes Corporate interest includes interest on unsecured debt issued by the BHE holding company and borrowings from Berkshire insurance subsidiaries in connection with certain of BHE’s business acquisitions. The borrowings from Berkshire insurance subsidiaries were repaid in the third quarter of 2017. Corporate interest in 2017 also included pre-tax charges of $410 million from a tender offer completed in December 2017 to redeem certain long-term debt of BHE. Otherwise, corporate interest declined 6% and 7%, respectively, in 2018 and 2017 as compared to the corresponding prior years, primarily due to lower average borrowings. K-44 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) Corporate interest and income taxes (Continued) BHE’s consolidated effective income tax rates were (18.3)% in 2018, 5.9% in 2017 and 12.9% in 2016. BHE’s effective income tax rates regularly reflect significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation placed in service by our domestic regulated utilities and other energy businesses. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 was attributable to the reduction in the U.S. Federal corporate income tax rate, the impacts of rate making, adjustments to the amounts recorded for the repatriation tax on foreign earnings, higher production tax credits and lower U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings. The effective income tax rate in 2017 decreased versus 2016 primarily due to an increase in production tax credits. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Revenues Earnings * 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 Manufacturing $ 61,883 $ 57,645 $ 52,969 $ 9,366 $ 8,324 $ 7,735 Service and retailing 78,926 76,994 74,467 2,942 2,603 2,489 $ 140,809 $ 134,639 $ 127,436 Pre-tax earnings 12,308 10,927 10,224 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 2,944 3,645 3,421 $ 9,364 $ 7,282 $ 6,803 Effective income tax rate 23.4% 32.8% 33.0% * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which primarily related to the amortization of identified intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings above were $932 million in 2018, $937 million in 2017 and $814 million in 2016. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page K-32 and in the “Other” earnings section on page K-53. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. Industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International (“CTB”)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products (“LSPI”)). Marmon includes UTLX Company (“UTLX”), which provides various products and services (including equipment leasing) for the rail and mobile crane industries. The building products group includes homebuilding and manufactured housing finance (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore), and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and the Duracell Company (“Duracell”), a manufacturer of high performance alkaline batteries. This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 Industrial products $ 30,679 $ 28,566 $ 26,935 $ 5,822 $ 5,065 $ 4,989 Building products 18,677 16,946 15,002 2,336 2,147 1,922 Consumer products 12,527 12,133 11,032 1,208 1,112 824 $ 61,883 $ 57,645 $ 52,969 $ 9,366 $ 8,324 $ 7,735 K-45 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products 2018 versus 2017 Revenues from industrial products businesses were approximately $30.7 billion in 2018, an increase of approximately $2.1 billion (7.4%) compared to 2017. PCC’s revenues in 2018 were $10.2 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to 2017. The increase reflected increased demand in aerospace markets in connection with new aircraft programs, partly offset by lower demand for industrial gas turbine products. PCC is in the process of repurposing certain manufacturing assets previously used to support industrial gas turbine business to accommodate aerospace products. In addition, PCC experienced lower sales of certain pipe products in 2018, primarily attributable to the U.S tariffs. Lubrizol’s revenues in 2018 were $6.8 billion, an increase of 5.9% compared to 2017 due to higher average sales prices, favorable changes in product mix and foreign currency translation effects, and a 2% increase in aggregate unit volumes. Lubrizol experienced significant increases in average material unit costs during 2018 and 2017, necessitating increases in sales prices. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume included increases in the Advanced Materials (5%) and the Additives (1%) product lines. Marmon’s revenues in 2018 were $8.2 billion, an increase of 5.5% as compared to 2017. The revenue increase was primarily attributable to volume increases in the Transportation Products sector, higher average metals prices in the Plumbing & Refrigeration, Electrical Products, and Metal Services sectors, and business acquisitions in the Transportation Products, Crane Services, and Engineered Wire & Cable sectors. These increases were partially offset by revenue decreases in the Beverage Technologies and Rail Products and Services sectors. Rail Products and Services sector revenues decreased due to lower railcar lease revenues, partly offset by increased railcar equipment sales and repair services. Throughout 2018, the railcar leasing business experienced the negative effects of lower lease renewal rates for railcars versus the rates on expiring leases. IMC’s revenues increased 16.1% in 2018 compared to 2017, due to a combination of factors, including higher unit sales, the effects of business acquisitions during 2017 and 2018, and foreign currency translation effects from a weaker average U.S. Dollar in the first half of 2018. CTB’s revenues increased 4.0% in 2018 versus 2017, due to favorable foreign currency translation effects and modest sales growth in protein production and processing systems. Pre-tax earnings of the industrial products group were approximately $5.8 billion in 2018, an increase of $757 million (14.9%) compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 19.0% in 2018 and 17.7% in 2017. The comparative earnings increase was partially attributable to certain one-time charges at PCC and Lubrizol in 2017. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 16.0% in 2018 compared to 2017. PCC’s earnings in 2017 included certain one-time inventory and impairment charges of $272 million. Results in 2018 were negatively affected by costs associated with the temporary unplanned shut-down of certain metals facilities, metal press outages and lower earnings from the industrial gas turbine business. The facilities that were shut-down gradually resumed production and were approximately 80% operational at the end of 2018. These facilities are expected to resume normal production in early 2019. In addition, the aforementioned new aircraft programs involve relatively complex manufacturing processes and manufacturing costs to-date have been relatively high, negatively affecting earnings. However, we expect costs will decline as processes improve and efficiencies develop. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2018 increased 43.5% compared to earnings in 2017, which included pre-tax losses of approximately $190 million related to Lubrizol’s disposition of an underperforming bolt-on business and related intangible asset impairments and restructuring charges. Before such charges, Lubrizol’s earnings increased 17%, reflecting the previously mentioned increases in sales volumes and selling prices, as well as lower other restructuring charges, lower net interest expense, and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and ongoing expense control efforts, partly offset by higher raw material costs. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2018 decreased 5.6% compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower pre-tax earnings from the Rail Products and Services sector ($126 million) and the Foodservice Technologies and Retail Solutions sectors ($33 million), partially offset by increased earnings from the Transportation Products sector and a non-recurring gain of $42 million in 2018 from the sale of certain assets of the Beverage Technologies sector. The Rail Products and Services earnings decline was attributable to lower railcar leasing revenues and higher lease fleet repair costs. K-46 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased significantly in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting a combination of higher sales, increased manufacturing efficiencies, the effects of business acquisitions and ongoing expense control efforts, partly offset by higher raw material costs. CTB’s pre-tax earnings in 2018 were lower, primarily due to lower gross sales margins attributable to raw material cost increases and higher other operating expenses. 2017 versus 2016 Industrial products revenues were approximately $28.6 billion in 2017, an increase of approximately $1.6 billion (6.1%) versus 2016, reflecting increased revenues at several of our businesses. PCC’s revenues increased $754 million (8.6%) in 2017 compared to the eleven-month post-acquisition period in 2016. On a comparable full year-to-date basis, PCC’s revenues increased approximately 2.3% compared to 2016. In 2017, PCC generated revenue increases from structural castings, airfoils and forged products and from business acquisitions, partly offset by lower revenues from airframe products and industrial gas turbine products used in power markets. Revenue increases associated with PCC’s transition into products for new aerospace programs were partly offset by revenue decreases from the winding down of prior programs. Lubrizol’s revenues increased $165 million (2.6%) compared to 2016, primarily due to higher unit volumes, partly offset by effects of the disposition of an underperforming business. Marmon’s revenues increased $305 million (4.1%) in 2017 versus 2016, primarily due to business acquisitions and higher average metal prices, partly offset by lower overall volumes, changes in mix and lower leasing revenues from the Rail Products and Services sector. Railcar leasing revenues declined due to fewer railcars on lease at lower rates. During 2017, railcars available for lease exceeded demand, which contributed to the lower lease rates. IMC’s revenues increased 13.3%, primarily due to increased customer demand and from business acquisitions. The global demand for cutting tools was generally higher in 2017. CTB’s revenues increased 5.3% in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase reflected the impact of a bolt-on business acquisition, partly offset by weak demand in the U.S. egg and poultry production markets and selling price pressures for grain storage systems. Industrial products pre-tax earnings were approximately $5.1 billion in 2017, an increase of $76 million (1.5%) compared to 2016. Overall, pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 17.7% in 2017 and 18.5% in 2016. PCC’s pre-tax earnings declined 12.5% in 2017 compared to the post-acquisition period in 2016, primarily due to certain one-time inventory and impairment charges. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings increased 17.3% in 2017 compared to 2016, due to the disposition in 2016 of an underperforming bolt-on business and ongoing cost containment efforts, partly offset by lower gross sales margins, which were primarily attributable to higher average raw material prices. In 2017, average raw material prices at Lubrizol, including base oil feedstock and petrochemicals, increased about 9% versus 2016. Marmon’s earnings in 2017 declined 3.5% compared to 2016, primarily due to lower earnings of the Rail Products and Services sector, partially offset by the effects of business acquisitions and ongoing cost control efforts. Building products 2018 versus 2017 Revenues of the building products group in 2018 were approximately $18.7 billion, an increase of 10.2% compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings of the building products group were approximately $2.3 billion in 2018, an increase of 8.8% versus 2017. Overall, pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 12.5% in 2018 and 12.7% in 2017. The pre-tax earnings increase was primarily due to higher earnings from Clayton Homes and Shaw, partly offset by lower earnings from Johns Manville. Clayton Homes’ revenues were $6,046 million in 2018, an increase of $1,036 million (20.7%) over 2017. The increase was driven by an increase in revenues from home sales of $971 million (28.2%), primarily due to a 105% increase in unit sales of site built homes attributable to businesses acquired over the last two years. Unit sales of manufactured homes in 2018 also increased 4.9% compared to 2017. Average unit prices of site built homes are considerably higher than traditional manufactured homes. In addition, interest income from lending activities increased 4% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increased average outstanding loan balances. K-47 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) Clayton Homes pre-tax earnings were $911 million in 2018, an increase of $145 million (19.0%) compared to 2017. The increase in earnings in 2018 was primarily attributable to a significant increase in earnings from home building (manufactured housing and site built homes) activities, which reflected the impact of increased home sales and margins, as well as increased earnings from lending activities. A significant part of Clayton Homes’ earnings derives from manufactured housing lending activities. Pre-tax earnings from lending activities in 2018 declined 2% compared to 2017, reflecting increased interest expense, attributable to higher average debt balances and interest rates and higher operating costs, which more than offset the increase in interest income. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, aggregate loan balances outstanding were approximately $14.7 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively. Revenues of our other building products businesses increased 5.8% in 2018 to approximately $12.6 billion compared to 2017. In 2018, Shaw’s sales increased 7.9% and Johns Manville’s sales increased 7.2% as compared to 2017. The increases reflected higher average selling prices, product mix changes and overall unit volume increases. Raw material and production costs of our building products businesses were generally higher in 2018. In particular, costs for steel, titanium dioxide and petrochemicals were substantially higher in 2018 than in 2017, as were product delivery costs, due in part to the shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. These cost increases precipitated sales price increases, although such increases have lagged the increases in raw materials costs. As a result, the increase in pre-tax earnings in 2018 of our other building products businesses ($43 million or 3.1%) lagged the 5.8% increase in revenues. 2017 versus 2016 Building products revenues were approximately $16.9 billion in 2017, an increase of approximately $1.9 billion (13.0%) compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to bolt-on business acquisitions by Clayton, Shaw and MiTek. The remainder of the increase reflected sales volume increases at MiTek, Benjamin Moore and Johns Manville, partly offset by changes in prices and product mix. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $5.0 billion in 2017, an increase of $780 million (18%) compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to sales from newly-acquired site built home businesses, an increase in overall unit sales (9%) and higher average prices. Interest income from lending activities and other and financial services revenues increased 2% in 2017 compared to 2016. Building products pre-tax earnings were $2.1 billion in 2017, an increase of $225 million (11.7%) compared to 2016. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 12.7% in 2017 and 12.8% in 2016. Clayton Homes’ pre-tax earnings increased $21 million (2.8%) in 2017 compared to 2016. Pre-tax earnings in 2017 from manufacturing, retailing and site built activities increased, while earnings from finance activities declined slightly. Clayton Homes’ earnings in 2017 also included a gain from a legal settlement, offset by increased employee healthcare, technology, marketing and other expenses. The comparative earnings increase reflected the effects of asset impairment, pension settlement and environmental claim charges of $107 million recorded in 2016 by Shaw and Benjamin Moore. The comparative earnings increase also was a result of bolt-on acquisitions, partly offset by comparative declines in average gross sales margin rates due to higher raw material and other production costs. Consumer products 2018 versus 2017 Consumer products revenues were approximately $12.5 billion in 2018, an increase of $394 million (3.2%) compared to 2017, which was primarily due to revenue increases of Forest River and of our apparel and footwear businesses. Forest River’s revenues increased 2.6% in 2018, reflecting relatively unchanged unit sales versus 2017. However, over the second half of the year, comparative sales declined 5%, reflecting a 7% decline in units sold. Management attributes the slowing of sales, in part, to the effects of U.S. tariffs on steel products. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 4.6% to approximately $4.3 billion, primarily due to increased sales volume at Brooks Sports and Garan. Pre-tax earnings were $1,208 million in 2018, an increase of $96 million (8.6%) compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 9.6% in 2018 and 9.2% in 2017. The increase in earnings reflected increases from Duracell and the apparel and footwear businesses, partly offset by lower earnings from Forest River and Larson Juhl. K-48 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Consumer products (Continued) Forest River’s pre-tax earnings in 2018 declined 9.0% compared to 2017. Operating results were adversely affected over the second half of 2018, and in the fourth quarter in particular, by higher material costs, which, together with the effects of lower sales volumes, contributed to a 28% reduction in fourth quarter pre-tax earnings. Pre-tax earnings of the apparel and footwear businesses increased 6.4% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily attributable to the overall increase in revenues and sales mix changes. Duracell’s pre-tax earnings increased in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting the favorable effects of ongoing operational improvement efforts and a comparative decline in restructuring charges. Since its acquisition in 2016, Duracell has undertaken significant transition and restructuring initiatives intended to restore and maintain adequate profit levels over the long-term. 2017 versus 2016 Consumer products revenues were approximately $12.1 billion in 2017, an increase of $1.1 billion (10%) compared to 2016, driven by increases from Duracell and Forest River. Duracell’s revenues increased 25.3% in 2017 compared to the ten-month post-acquisition period in 2016. Forest River’s revenues increased 13.7% in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting a 13.5% comparative increase in units sold. Apparel and footwear revenues were approximately $4.2 billion in 2017, an increase of 1.6% compared to 2016. Consumer products pre-tax earnings increased $288 million (35%) in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in earnings was primarily due to increased earnings from Duracell and Forest River. The improvement in Duracell’s operating results in 2017 reflects an overall reduction in transition costs and the positive effects of ongoing restructuring and business development efforts. Forest River’s earnings increased 23% in 2017, primarily attributable to the increase in sales and lower manufacturing overhead rates. Earnings from apparel and footwear businesses increased 5% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased earnings from the footwear businesses. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 Service $ 13,333 $ 12,155 $ 11,300 $ 1,836 $ 1,519 $ 1,399 Retailing 15,606 15,064 15,092 860 785 659 McLane Company 49,987 49,775 48,075 246 299 431 $ 78,926 $ 76,994 $ 74,467 $ 2,942 $ 2,603 $ 2,489 Service Our service business group offers fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI) and franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire), publication of newspapers and other publications (Buffalo News and the BH Media Group) and operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). We also offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). K-49 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service (Continued) 2018 versus 2017 Revenues of the service group were approximately $13.3 billion in 2018, an increase of approximately $1.2 billion (9.7%) compared to 2017. TTI’s revenues in 2018 increased approximately 33.7% compared to 2017, reflecting industry-wide increases in demand for electronic components in many geographic markets around the world, and the effects of recent business acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation effects. While TTI’s revenue increase in 2018 was significant, revenue growth began to moderate in the fourth quarter, in part attributable to the impact of U.S. trade tariffs. WPLG generated a revenue increase of 20.8% in 2018 over 2017, primarily due to increased political advertising revenue. Revenues of Charter Brokerage increased 53.3%, reflecting increased fees and product mix changes. Revenues of our leasing businesses increased 8.4% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to increased over-the road trailer units on lease (XTRA) and increased furniture rental income (CORT). Pre-tax earnings of the service group in 2018 were approximately $1.8 billion, an increase of $317 million (20.9%) compared to 2017. The comparative earnings increase was primarily due to TTI, which accounted for almost 84% of the increase. The earnings increase of TTI was primarily due to the effects of the sales volume increases. In addition, XTRA, Charter Brokerage and NetJets each generated increased earnings in 2018 compared to 2017. The increases in earnings of these businesses were partly offset by lower earnings at FlightSafety, primarily due to reduced margins from sales of flight simulators and impairment charges of $41 million related to certain fixed assets. 2017 versus 2016 Service business revenues were approximately $12.2 billion in 2017, an increase of $855 million (7.6%) compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to TTI and NetJets. TTI’s revenues increased 16.4% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher customer demand. NetJets’ revenues increased due to an increase in revenue flight hours and increased aircraft management services. Pre-tax earnings were approximately $1.5 billion in 2017, an increase of $120 million (8.6%) compared to 2016. The comparative increase in earnings was primarily attributable to increased earnings of NetJets and TTI, partly offset by comparatively lower earnings from FlightSafety, and from our leasing, media and logistics businesses. Retailing Our retailers include Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”). BHA includes over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles, and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories. 2018 versus 2017 Revenues of the retailing group were approximately $15.6 billion in 2018, an increase of $542 million (3.6%) compared to 2017. BHA’s revenues, which represented approximately 63% of the aggregate retailing revenues in each of the past three years, increased 4.0% in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase derived primarily from increased pre-owned vehicle sales and service contract revenues. Revenues from new vehicle sales were relatively unchanged. Louis revenues increased 7.8% in 2018 versus 2017, primarily due to the translation effects of a weaker average U.S. Dollar. Home furnishings revenues increased 4.7% in 2018 over 2017, reflecting increased sales in certain geographic markets and the effect of a new store. Pre-tax earnings of the retailing group were $860 million in 2018, an increase of $75 million (9.6%) over 2017. The earnings increase included higher earnings from BHA and Louis, partly offset by lower earnings from the home furnishings retailers. The earnings increase of BHA was primarily from finance and service contract activities, partly offset by higher floorplan interest expense. The earnings increase at Louis reflected the revenues increase and an increase in operating margin rate. Earnings of the home furnishings businesses declined 2.4% in 2018 compared to 2017, partly due to increased inventory liquidation, delivery and occupancy costs at Star Furniture. K-50 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) 2017 versus 2016 Retailing revenues were $15.1 billion in 2017, slightly lower than in 2016. BHA’s aggregate revenues declined 1.3% in 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily due to a 3.7% decline in new and used cars sold, partly offset by higher service and finance revenues. Revenues of our other retailers increased 1.7% in 2017 compared to 2016. Pre-tax earnings increased $126 million (19.1%) in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase reflected comparatively higher earnings from BHA, primarily due to increased earnings from service contract and finance activities and lower selling and administrative expenses, partly offset by lower auto sales volumes and margins. Pre-tax earnings of our home furnishings retailers increased 6.5% in 2017 compared to 2016. Pampered Chef also produced comparatively higher earnings in 2017, primarily attributable to revenue increases and expense management efforts. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised approximately 67% of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2018 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. McLane’s revenues were approximately $50.0 billion in 2018, slightly higher than 2017, reflecting a slight increase in grocery sales (1%) and a slight decrease in foodservice sales (1%). The decline in foodservice revenues was primarily due to a net loss of customers. Pre-tax earnings were $246 million in 2018, a decline of $53 million (17.7%), compared to 2017. McLane’s grocery and foodservice businesses continue to operate in a highly competitive business environment, which is negatively affecting its current operating results. While gross margin rates increased slightly over 2018, increases in fuel, depreciation and certain other operating expenses more than offset the increase, producing a decline in pre-tax earnings compared to 2017. We expect the current unfavorable operating conditions will continue in 2019. McLane’s revenues were approximately $49.8 billion in 2017, an increase of 3.5% compared to 2016. The increase in revenues was primarily due to a 4.7% increase in grocery business sales. Pre-tax earnings in 2017 were $299 million, a decrease of $132 million (30.6%) compared to 2016. The earnings decline reflected a 57% decline in earnings from our grocery operations, partly offset by a $39 million increase in gains from asset sales. Throughout 2017, significant pricing pressures and an increasingly competitive business environment negatively affected McLane’s operating results, particularly with respect to the grocery business. Investment and Derivative Gains (Losses) A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses follows (dollars in millions). 2018 2017 2016 Investment gains (losses) $ (22,155 ) $ 1,410 $7,553 Derivative gains (losses) (300 ) 718 751 Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests (22,455 ) 2,128 8,304 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (4,718 ) 751 1,807 Net gains (losses) $ (17,737 ) $ 1,377 $6,497 Effective income tax rate 20.8% 34.9% 21.8% K-51 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains (Losses) (Continued) Investment gains (losses) As discussed in Note 1(w) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, on January 1, 2018, we adopted a new accounting pronouncement (“ASU 2016-01”), which requires the recognition of unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market values of investments in equity securities in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Prior to 2018, investment gains/losses related to equity securities were generally recorded as the securities were sold, redeemed or exchanged based on the cost of the disposed securities. While ASU 2016-01 does not affect our consolidated shareholders’ equity or total comprehensive income, it has significantly increased the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Investment gains and losses from periodic changes in securities prices will continue to cause significant volatility in our consolidated earnings. Pre-tax investment gains/losses reflected in earnings in 2018 included net unrealized losses of approximately $22.7 billion from investments in equity securities still held at December 31, 2018, reflecting the declines in securities prices in the fourth quarter. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-01, such unrealized gains and losses were included in other comprehensive income. Pre-tax net unrealized gains on equity securities recorded in other comprehensive income were approximately $29 billion in 2017 and $7 billion in 2016. Pre-tax investment gains were approximately $1.4 billion in 2017 and $7.6 billion in 2016. Investment gains in 2016 included $4.2 billion from the redemptions of our Wrigley and Kraft Heinz preferred stock investments and from the sales of Dow Chemical common stock that was received upon the conversion of our Dow Chemical preferred stock investment. We also realized pre-tax gains of $1.1 billion in connection with the tax-free exchange of our shares of P&G common stock for 100% of the common stock of Duracell. Income tax expense allocated to investment gains in 2016 included a benefit from the reduction of certain deferred income tax liabilities in connection with the exchange of P&G common stock for Duracell. Our after-tax gain from this transaction was approximately $1.9 billion. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings, including the changes in market prices for equity securities, in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative gains (losses) Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities. These liabilities relate to contracts entered into before March 2008. Substantially all of these contracts will expire between April 2019 and February 2023. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying equity markets and the changes in the inputs used to measure such liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was approximately $1,653 million and our recorded liabilities at fair value were approximately $2,452 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. Contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately $12.2 billion will expire in 2019. Derivative contracts produced pre-tax losses in 2018 of $300 million, which were primarily due to lower index values. Equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax gains of $718 million in 2017 and $662 million in 2016, which reflected the effects of shorter remaining contract durations and overall higher index values. In July 2016, our last credit default contract was terminated by mutual agreement with the counterparty and we paid the counterparty $195 million. This contract produced pre-tax earnings of $89 million in 2016. K-52 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other A summary of after-tax other earnings (losses) follows (in millions). 2018 2017 2016 Equity method earnings (losses) $ (1,419) $ 1,111 $ 707 Acquisition accounting expenses (1,111) (936) (846) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (311) (266) (256) Euro note foreign exchange gains (losses) 289 (655) 159 Corporate interest and dividend income 530 232 288 Other 456 29 (83) Net earnings (losses) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ (1,566) $ (485) $ (31) After-tax equity method earnings includes Berkshire’s share of earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz, Pilot Flying J, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. Our after-tax equity method losses in 2018 included approximately $2.7 billion from intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Our after-tax equity method earnings in 2017 excluded approximately $1.1 billion from the net effects of the TCJA on Kraft Heinz’s net earnings. Corporate interest and dividend income in 2016 included pre-tax dividend income of $180 million from our Kraft Heinz preferred stock investment, which Kraft Heinz redeemed in June 2016. After-tax other earnings (losses) also include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges were primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Berkshire issued Euro denominated debt in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and the aggregate par amount outstanding was €6.85 billion at December 31, 2018. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produced sizable non-cash unrealized gains and losses in each of the past three years from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2018 was approximately $349 billion, a decrease of $26.9 billion since September 30, 2018 and an increase of $407 million since December 31, 2017. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in 2018 were $4.0 billion, which included after-tax losses on our investments of approximately $17.5 billion. After-tax losses on investments were approximately $27.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, reflecting the declines in market prices of the equity securities we owned at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of approximately $109 billion, which included $85 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were approximately $193 billion. Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2018 was approximately $16.9 billion, a decrease of $1.9 billion since December 31, 2017, reflecting term debt maturities of $1.55 billion and a $366 million decrease attributable to foreign currency exchange rate changes applicable to the €6.85 billion par amount of Euro denominated senior notes. Berkshire parent company debt of $750 million matures in 2019. Borrowings of Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiaries declined $3.5 billion in 2018 to approximately $18.1 billion at December 31, 2018, primarily attributable to a net decrease in borrowings of Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”), a wholly-owned financing subsidiary. During 2018, BHFC repaid $4.6 billion of maturing senior notes and issued $2.35 billion of 4.2% senior notes due in 2048. BHFC’s senior note borrowings are used to fund loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and a portion of assets held for lease by our UTLX railcar leasing business. In January 2019, BHFC repaid $950 million of maturing senior notes and issued $1.25 billion of 4.25% senior notes due in 2049. An additional $3.0 billion of BHFC senior notes will mature in 2019. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast capital expenditures of these two operations will approximate $10.5 billion for the year ending December 31, 2019. K-53 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) BNSF’s outstanding debt approximated $23.2 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $727 million since December 31, 2017. In 2018, BNSF issued $1.5 billion of senior unsecured debentures due in 2048 with a weighted average interest rate of 4.1%. BNSF debentures of $750 million will mature in 2019. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were approximately $39.3 billion at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $390 million since December 31, 2017. In 2018, BHE issued $3.2 billion of senior unsecured debt with maturities ranging from 2021 to 2049 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.6%. BHE subsidiaries also issued debt in 2018, aggregating $2.3 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2020 to 2049. The proceeds from these financings were used to repay borrowings, to fund capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes. Approximately $2.1 billion of BHE subsidiary term debt will mature in 2019. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program was amended on July 17, 2018, permitting Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Subsequent to the program amendment, in 2018, Berkshire repurchased shares of Class A and B common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $1.3 billion. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as minimum rentals under operating leases and certain purchase obligations not currently reflected in the financial statements, will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. Beginning in 2019, operating lease obligations will be included in the consolidated balance sheet upon the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. The timing and amount of the payments under certain contracts, such as insurance and reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 follows (in millions). Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table.

(3) Amounts represent estimated undiscounted benefits, net of estimated future premiums, as applicable. K-54 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2018 follows. Property and casualty losses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities and all techniques require significant judgments and assumptions. As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include provisions for reported claims, as well as claims not yet reported and the development of reported claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails. Our consolidated claim liabilities as of December 31, 2018 were approximately $110 billion, of which 84% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques of these businesses follows. GEICO GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December 31, 2018, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses were $19.5 billion. Claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable were $18.6 billion. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies. Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2018, case development liabilities averaged approximately 30% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities. For incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims, liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2017 decreased $222 million during 2018, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. We modified the assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2018 to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated. With respect to liabilities for BI claims, our most significant claim category, we believe it is reasonably possible that average severities will change by at least one percentage point from the severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2018. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $275 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. K-55 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through NICO and General Re. In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of premium and loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk), per occurrence excess or retroactive reinsurance contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract if reinsurer personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. However, loss information is often less detailed with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts. Additionally, loss information we receive through periodic reports is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR estimates to reinsurers. Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. Periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies. In the U.S., such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period. Outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. In some instances, reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks thereby creating multiple contractual parties between us and the primary insured, potentially compounding the claim reporting delays. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage, and for other reasons. As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. When received, we review the information for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s books and records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. K-56 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) (Continued) With respect to General Re, we use a variety of actuarial methodologies to establish unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. Certain methodologies, such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, are utilized, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate. The critical processes involved in estimating unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include the establishment of case liability estimates, the determination of expected loss ratios and loss reporting patterns, which drive IBNR liability estimates, and the comparison of reported activity to the expected loss reporting patterns. General Re’s process for estimating unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses starts with case loss estimates reported by ceding companies. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. As of December 31, 2018, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $2.0 billion, which were concentrated in legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates. In estimating IBNR liabilities, General Re considers expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. In this process, we classify all loss and premium data into groups or portfolios of policies based primarily on product type (e.g., treaty, facultative and program), line of business (e.g., auto liability, property and workers’ compensation) and/or geographic jurisdiction, and in some cases contractual features or market segment. For each portfolio, we aggregate premiums and losses by accident year or coverage period and analyze the paid and incurred loss data over time. We estimate the expected development of reported claims, which, together with the expected loss ratios, are used to calculate IBNR liability estimates. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns. NICO generally establishes reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis determined from case loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimates. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgments on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events. Certain catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. BHRG’s estimated ultimate net losses for prior years’ loss events were reduced $469 million in 2018, which produced a corresponding increase in pre-tax earnings. Reported claims for prior years’ property loss events were less than anticipated and we reduced our estimated ultimate liabilities by $365 million. Property losses incurred during any given period may be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophe and large individual property loss events. In addition, we lowered estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ casualty events $104 million in 2018, reflecting reduced estimates for workers’ compensation and other casualty coverages, partially offset by an increase in estimates for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. General Re’s reported losses for prior years’ workers’ compensation claims were less than expected. After reevaluating expected remaining IBNR estimates, liabilities were reduced by $117 million. An increase of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1 billion in General Re’s workers’ compensation IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. We reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ events for other casualty losses, excluding asbestos, environmental, and other latent injury claims, by $132 million in 2018, reflecting lower than expected reported losses. For General Re’s significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that an increase of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and a five percent increase in expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $800 million. While we believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates, more likely outcomes are less than $800 million given the diversification in worldwide business. K-57 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) (Continued) Estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims were increased approximately $145 million in 2018, which produced a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings. Net liabilities for such claims, excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2018. We may use industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment when internal loss data is of limited reliability in making estimates for such losses. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment, and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider “survival ratios,” which is the average net claim payments in recent years in relation to net unpaid losses, as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. Our survival ratio was approximately 16 years as of December 31, 2018. Retroactive reinsurance Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities relating to our retroactive reinsurance contracts are predominately related to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-tails to be very long. Our gross unpaid losses, deferred charge assets, and net liabilities at December 31, 2018 were as follows (in millions). Gross unpaid losses Deferred charges Liabilities, net ofdeferred charges December 31, 2018 $ 41,834 $ 14,104 $ 27,730 Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications. We currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $55 billion due to the applicable aggregate contract limits. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our $41.8 billion estimated liability at December 31, 2018. We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expected results are revealed. Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $13.1 billion at December 31, 2018. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect these claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities. We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $341 million in 2018, which after the changes in related deferred charge assets, resulted in pre-tax earnings of $185 million. In 2018, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of approximately $1.4 billion with respect to these contracts. In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums. We amortize deferred charge assets, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances and the amount of periodic amortization. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2018, we currently estimate that amortization expense in 2019 will approximate $1.2 billion. K-58 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $81.0 billion. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2018. Our review includes determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then, as required by GAAP, we estimate the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied goodwill value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Equity Price Risk Equity securities represent a significant portion of our investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2018, approximately 68% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in five issuers. We often hold our equity investments for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, fair values of these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contracts. The following table summarizes our equity securities and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio.

K-59 Table of Contents Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Interest Rate Risk We may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit ratings, in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2018 and 2017. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, such as The Coca-Cola Company, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and do not use derivative contracts to hedge or manage foreign currency price changes in any meaningful way. Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and services subsidiaries. This translation related impact may be offset by gains or losses included in net earnings related to net liabilities of Berkshire and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies, due to changes in exchange rates. A summary of these gains (losses), after-tax, for each of the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017 follows (in millions). 2018 2017 Euro-denominated debt included in net earnings $ 289 $ (655) Net liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts included in net earnings 207 (295) Foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income (1,424) 2,151 Commodity Price Risk Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We may utilize derivative contracts to manage a portion of commodity price risks at BHE. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page K-62.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Insurance – underwriting $ 325 $ 1,566 $ (2,219 ) Insurance – investment income 5,530 4,554 3,887 Railroad 5,481 5,219 3,959 Utilities and energy 2,840 2,621 2,033 Manufacturing, service and retailing 9,372 9,364 7,282 Investment and derivative gains/losses 57,445 (17,737 ) 1,377 Other 424 (1,566 ) (485 ) Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 — — 29,106 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 81,417 $ 4,021 $ 44,940 Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 27 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Beginning in 2018, our periodic net earnings include changes in unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities. These gains and losses have been very significant given the size of our holdings and the inherent volatility in securities prices, producing extraordinary volatility in our reported net earnings for 2019 and 2018. Prior to 2018, the changes in unrealized gains and losses pertaining to such investments were recorded in other comprehensive income. The new accounting treatment has no effect on our consolidated shareholders’ equity. Net earnings in 2017 included approximately $29.1 billion attributable to a one-time net benefit from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) on December 22, 2017. This benefit included approximately $29.6 billion related to a one-time non-cash reduction of net deferred income tax liabilities from the reduction in the statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and a net benefit of approximately $900 million primarily attributable to our earnings from Kraft Heinz, partly offset by a one-time income tax expense of approximately $1.4 billion on the deemed repatriation of certain accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Due to the significance, we presented these one-time effects as a distinct item in the preceding table. Accordingly, the after-tax figures presented for 2017 in the discussion of our various operating businesses and other activities exclude the one-time effects of the TCJA. After-tax earnings of our business operations in 2019 and 2018 were favorably affected by lower U.S. income tax expense compared to 2017, primarily attributable to a reduction in the statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The effect of the lower U.S. statutory income tax rate on the comparative after-tax earnings of our various business operations varied, reflecting the differences in the mix of earnings subject to income tax, income tax credits and the effects of state and local income taxes. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $325 million in 2019 compared to earnings of $1.6 billion in 2018 and after-tax losses of approximately $2.2 billion in 2017. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $800 million in 2019, $1.3 billion in 2018 and $1.95 billion in 2017. Earnings from primary insurance operations were lower in 2019 and losses from reinsurance were higher than in 2018. After-tax underwriting earnings in 2019 included lower earnings from reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ property/casualty loss events as compared to 2018 and losses of $92 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes on certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries. Underwriting results included after-tax foreign currency exchange rate gains of $207 million in 2018 and losses of $295 million in 2017. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2019 increased 21.4% over 2018, which increased 17.2% over 2017. These increases reflected increases in interest and dividend income. K-32 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Results of Operations (Continued) After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 5.0% in 2019 compared to 2018. Earnings in 2019 benefitted from higher rates per car/unit, a curtailment gain related to an amendment to defined benefit retirement plans and ongoing operating cost control initiatives, partly offset by lower freight volumes and incremental costs associated with the persistent flooding conditions and severe winter weather in the first half of the year. All key routes impacted by flooding resumed service by the third quarter. Our railroad business generated a 31.8% increase in after-tax earnings in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting an increase in unit volume, higher average revenue per car/unit and a lower effective income tax rate, partly offset by increased fuel and other operating costs. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 8.4% in 2019 compared to 2018 as all businesses produced higher earnings in 2019 versus 2018. Our utilities and energy businesses produced higher after-tax earnings in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the effects of losses incurred in 2017 in connection with the prepayment of certain long-term debt, increased earnings at the natural gas pipelines and other energy businesses and the TCJA income tax benefits recognized in 2018. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses were relatively unchanged from 2018. Operating results of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2019 were mixed, with several of these businesses experiencing lower earnings in 2019 from a variety of factors. Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2019 of certain of these businesses were negatively affected by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar, international trade tensions and U.S. trade tariffs. After-tax earnings in 2018 of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 29% over 2017, due to lower effective income tax rates and a 13% increase in pre-tax earnings. Investment and derivative gains/losses in 2019 and 2018 included significant unrealized gains and losses from market price changes on our holdings of equity securities. After-tax unrealized gains on equity securities were approximately $53.7 billion in 2019 compared to after-tax losses of $20.6 billion in 2018. After-tax investment gains in 2019 also included after-tax realized gains on sales of equity and fixed maturity securities of $2.6 billion compared to $3.1 billion in 2018. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. After-tax other earnings included equity method investment earnings of $1.0 billion in 2019, losses of $1.4 billion in 2018 and earnings of $1.1 billion in 2017. The losses in 2018 were attributable to Kraft Heinz, partly offset by earnings from other equity method investments. Other earnings also included foreign currency exchange rate gains of $58 million in 2019, $289 million in 2018, and losses of $655 million in 2017 related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S. based financing subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as a component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating, based on our long-held strategy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance operations. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider pre-tax catastrophe losses in excess of $100 million from a current year event as significant. We incurred estimated pre-tax losses of approximately $1.0 billion in 2019, $1.6 billion in 2018 and $3.0 billion in 2017 from significant catastrophe events. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $115.5 billion as of December 31, 2019. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. K-33 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Underwriting gain (loss): GEICO $ 1,506 $ 2,449 $ (310 ) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 383 670 719 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (1,472 ) (1,109 ) (3,648 ) Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 417 2,010 (3,239 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 92 444 (1,020 ) Net underwriting gain (loss) $ 325 $ 1,566 $ (2,219 ) Effective income tax rate 24.2 % 21.4 % 32.0 % GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 36,016 $ 34,123 $ 30,547 Premiums earned $ 35,572 100.0 $ 33,363 100.0 $ 29,441 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 28,937 81.3 26,278 78.8 25,497 86.6 Underwriting expenses 5,129 14.5 4,636 13.9 4,254 14.5 Total losses and expenses 34,066 95.8 30,914 92.7 29,751 101.1 Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) $ 1,506 $ 2,449 $ (310 ) 2019 versus 2018 Premiums written and earned in 2019 increased 5.5% and 6.6%, respectively, compared to 2018. These increases were primarily attributable to voluntary auto policies-in-force growth of 6.4% over the past twelve months, partially offset by a decrease in average premiums per auto policy due to coverage changes and changes in state and risk mix. The increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force primarily resulted from an increase in new business sales of 10.9% and a decrease in the number of policies not renewed. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 1,068,000 during 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2019 increased 10.1% to $28.9 billion. GEICO’s losses and loss adjustment expenses ratio in 2019 was 81.3%, an increase of 2.5 percentage points over 2018. The loss ratio increase in 2019 reflected continuing increases in loss severities, slightly offset by lower storm-related losses. Claims frequencies in 2019 declined compared to 2018 for property damage and collision coverages (two to four percent range) and personal injury protection coverage (one to two percent range) and were relatively unchanged for bodily injury coverage. Average claims severities in 2019 were higher versus 2018 for property damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range) and bodily injury coverage (seven to nine percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses regularly include changes in the ultimate claim loss estimates during the period for prior years’ loss events, which produce pre-tax underwriting earnings or losses in the period of the change. GEICO increased ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events by $42 million in 2019 compared to a decrease of $222 million in 2018. K-34 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Underwriting expenses in 2019 were $5.1 billion, an increase of $493 million (10.6%) over 2018. GEICO’s underwriting expense ratio in 2019 was 14.5%, an increase of 0.6 percentage points compared to 2018. The underwriting expense increase was primarily attributable to increases in advertising expenses and employee-related costs, which reflected wage and staffing increases. 2018 versus 2017 Premiums written were $34.1 billion in 2018, an increase of 11.7% compared to 2017. The increase reflected voluntary auto policies-in-force growth of 3.3% and increased premiums per auto policy of approximately 6.4%. The increase in premiums per policy was attributable to rate increases, coverage changes and changes in state and risk mix. The rate increases were in response to accelerating claim costs in previous years. Although policies-in-force increased 540,000 during 2018, the rate of increase slowed, as voluntary auto new business sales decreased 4.7% compared to 2017. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2018 were $26.3 billion, an increase of $781 million (3.1%) compared to 2017. GEICO’s losses and loss adjustment expenses ratio for 2018 was 78.8%, a decline of 7.8 percentage points compared to 2017. Losses from significant catastrophe events were $105 million in 2018 (Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California) and approximately $450 million in 2017 (Hurricanes Harvey and Irma). GEICO reduced ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events by $222 million in 2018 and increased estimated prior year ultimate liabilities by $517 million in 2017. Claims frequencies in 2018 for property damage, collision, and bodily and personal injury protection coverages declined (two to four percent range) compared to 2017. Average claims severities in 2018 increased for property damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range) and bodily injury coverage (five to seven percent range) versus 2017. Underwriting expenses in 2018 were approximately $4.6 billion, an increase of $382 million (9.0%) over 2017. GEICO’s underwriting expense ratio in 2018 was 13.9%, a decrease of 0.6 percentage points compared to 2017. The underwriting expense increase was primarily attributable to increases in advertising expenses, insurance premium taxes and employee-related costs, which reflected wage and staffing increases. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers are Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), and National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company, Applied Underwriters (sold in October 2019), Central States Indemnity Company and MLMIC Insurance Company, acquired October 1, 2018. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 9,843 $ 8,561 $ 7,483 Premiums earned $ 9,165 100.0 $ 8,111 100.0 $ 7,143 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 6,336 69.1 5,261 64.9 4,511 63.1 Underwriting expenses 2,446 26.7 2,180 26.9 1,913 26.8 Total losses and expenses 8,782 95.8 7,441 91.8 6,424 89.9 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 383 $ 670 $ 719 Premiums written in 2019 increased approximately $1.3 billion (15.0%) compared to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to volume increases from BH Specialty (30%), GUARD (28%) and MedPro Group (14%) and from the effects of the MLMIC acquisition, partially offset by the effects of the divestiture of Applied Underwriters and lower volume at BHHC. The increases in premiums earned in 2019 reflected the overall volume increase over the past year. K-35 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued) BH Primary produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $383 million in 2019 and $670 million in 2018. BH Primary’s aggregate loss ratios were 69.1% in 2019 and 64.9% in 2018. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred included reductions for prior years’ loss events of $499 million in 2019 and $715 million in 2018. The decrease in 2019 was primarily attributable to lower than anticipated medical professional liability and workers’ compensation losses, partially offset by higher commercial auto and other liability losses. There were no losses from significant catastrophe events in 2019 that affected BH Primary. Underwriting results in 2018 included estimated losses from Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California of approximately $190 million. Premiums written and earned in 2018 increased 14.4% and 13.6%, respectively, compared to 2017. The increases were primarily attributable to written premium growth at BH Specialty (33%), GUARD (19%), NICO Primary (14%) and BHHC (8%). BH Primary’s loss ratios were 64.9% in 2018 and 63.1% in 2017. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included losses from significant catastrophe events of $190 million in 2018 from Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California and $225 million in 2017 from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included net gains from the reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $715 million in 2018 and $766 million in 2017. The liability reductions in each year primarily related to healthcare malpractice and workers’ compensation business. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher than expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”) and General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and General Re Life Corporation (“General Re”). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN. Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Premiums earned in 2019 increased $983 million (11.0%) versus 2018. The increase in premiums written reflected overall growth in U.S. and international markets. The growth was primarily attributable to new business, net of non-renewals, and increased participations for renewal business, partly offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar. Property/casualty premiums written in 2018 were $9.4 billion, an increase of 22.0% over 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to new business and increased participations for renewal business in both property and casualty lines. Premiums earned included $1.7 billion in 2019 and $1.8 billion in both 2018 and 2017 from a 10-year, 20% quota-share contract with Insurance Australia Group Limited, which expires in 2025. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were $7.3 billion in 2019, $6.9 billion in 2018 and $7.2 billion in 2017 and losses and loss adjustment expense ratios were 73.8% in 2019, 77.6% in 2018 and 95.6% in 2017. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included incurred losses from significant catastrophe events occurring each year, including approximately $1.0 billion in 2019 ($700 million in the fourth quarter), $1.3 billion in 2018 ($1.1 billion in the fourth quarter) and $2.4 billion in 2017. Losses in 2019 derived from Typhoons Faxia and Hagibis and wildfires in California and Australia. Losses in 2018 derived from Hurricanes Florence and Michael, Typhoon Jebi and wildfires in California. Losses in 2017 derived from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, an earthquake in Mexico, a cyclone in Australia and wildfires in California. Before the effects of significant catastrophe events, losses and loss adjustment expense ratios were 64% in 2019, 63% in 2018 and 64% in 2017. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included gains from net decreases in estimated ultimate claim liabilities attributable to prior years’ loss events of approximately $295 million in 2019, $469 million in 2018 and $295 million in 2017. Such decreases as percentages of the related net unpaid claim liabilities as of the beginning of the applicable year were 1.0% in 2019, 1.7% in 2018 and 1.2% in 2017. Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 4,977 $ 5,446 $ 4,846 Premiums earned $ 4,883 100.0 $ 5,343 100.0 $ 4,808 100.0 Life and health insurance benefits 3,757 76.9 4,226 79.1 4,276 88.9 Underwriting expenses 800 16.4 901 16.9 584 12.2 Total benefits and expenses 4,557 93.3 5,127 96.0 4,860 101.1 Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) $ 326 $ 216 $ (52 ) K-37 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Life/health (Continued) Life/health premiums earned were $4.9 billion in 2019, a decrease of $460 million (8.6%) compared to 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, BHLN amended a yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract with a major reinsurer. The amendment effectively eliminated BHLN’s future exposures under the contract. BHLN recorded a reduction in earned premiums on this contract in 2019 of $49 million while premiums earned in 2018 related to this contract were $954 million. Life/health premiums earned in 2019 also included $228 million from a single reinsurance contract covering health insurance risks. We also experienced volume growth in several international life markets, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower U.S. life volumes. The life/health business produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $326 million in 2019. Underwriting results for 2019 included a one-time pre-tax gain of $163 million attributable to the yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract amendment. Pre-tax underwriting earnings in 2019 also included losses from increased disability benefit liabilities in Australia, attributable to higher claims experience and changes to various underlying assumptions, increased U.S. long-term care liabilities due to discount rate reductions and changes in other actuarial assumptions, and an increase in life claims in North America, partially offset by increased earnings from other international life business. Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings of $167 million in 2019. Underwriting results from this business reflect changes in estimated liabilities for guaranteed benefits, which derive from changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Life/health premiums earned in 2018 were $5.3 billion, an increase of $535 million (11.1%) over 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the North America, Asia and Australia life insurance markets. Our life/health business produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $216 million in 2018 and losses of $52 million in 2017. The underwriting earnings in 2018 reflected lower losses from the run-off of U.S. long-term care business, partially offset by lower earnings from the run-off of variable annuity guarantee contracts. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded pre-tax losses of $450 million from discount rate reductions and changes in other actuarial assumptions associated with long-term care liabilities. Pre-tax earnings from variable annuity guarantee contracts were $34 million in 2018 and $256 million in 2017. Retroactive reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance premiums earned in 2019 and 2018 were $684 million and $517 million, respectively, and were attributable to a limited number of contracts in each year. Premiums earned in 2017 included $10.2 billion from an aggregate excess-of-loss retroactive reinsurance agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (the “AIG Agreement”). At the inception of our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we record the estimated ultimate claim liabilities, and we also record the excess of such claim liabilities over the premiums received as a deferred charge asset. Thus, as of the inception dates of these contracts, there is no net underwriting gain or loss. Pre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amount of future claim payments, as well as from foreign currency gains/losses arising from the periodic remeasurement of liabilities related to contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign currency remeasurement produced pre-tax losses of $76 million in 2019, gains of $169 million in 2018 and losses of $264 million in 2017. Retroactive reinsurance contracts generated pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses of $1,189 million in 2019, $947 million in 2018 and $1,066 million in 2017. Losses included deferred charge amortization of $646 million in 2019, $611 million in 2018 and $527 million in 2017 related to the AIG Agreement. In 2019, we increased estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $378 million compared to a decrease of $341 million in 2018. After adjustments to the related unamortized deferred charges from changes in the estimated timing and amount of the future claim payments, such changes produced pre-tax underwriting losses of approximately $125 million in 2019 and earnings of $185 million in 2018. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $42.4 billion at December 31, 2019 and $41.8 billion at December 31, 2018. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts were $13.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and $14.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Deferred charge assets will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization. K-38 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned in 2019 were $863 million, a decrease of $293 million (25.3%) compared to 2018, while premiums earned in 2018 increased $258 million (28.7%) compared to 2017. Periodic payment annuity business is price sensitive. The volumes written can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments as well as the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include the effects of mortality and interest rate changes and remeasurement gains and losses related to foreign currency denominated liabilities of certain contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign currency remeasurement losses were $40 million in 2019 compared to gains of $93 million in 2018 and losses of $190 million in 2017. Excluding foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $509 million in 2019 compared to $433 million in 2018 and $481 million in 2017. These losses primarily derived from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities, as well as the impact of mortality and interest rate changes. Discounted annuity liabilities were $13.5 billion at December 31, 2019 and $12.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and at December 31, 2019, the weighted average discount rate was approximately 4.1%. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Interest and other investment income $ 2,075 $ 1,851 $ 1,263 Dividend income 4,525 3,652 3,592 Investment income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 6,600 5,503 4,855 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,070 949 968 Net investment income $ 5,530 $ 4,554 $ 3,887 Effective income tax rate 16.1 % 17.2 % 19.9 % Interest and other investment income in 2019 increased $224 million (12.1%) compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term investments and interest from a term loan with Seritage Growth Properties, partially offset by lower income earned from fixed maturity securities and limited partnership investments. Dividend income in 2019 increased $873 million (23.9%) compared to 2018. The increase in dividend income was attributable to an overall increase in investment levels over the past year, including the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% Cumulative Preferred Stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation on August 8, 2019, and higher dividend rates on common stock investments. We continue to hold large balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. While short-term interest yields in the U.S. were higher in the first half of 2019 compared to 2018, interest rates declined during the second half of the year. Accordingly, earnings from such balances will likely be lower in 2020 than in 2019. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Pre-tax interest and other investment income in 2018 increased $588 million (46.6%) compared to 2017. The increase reflected the effect of higher short-term interest rates in 2018 and higher other investment income, partly offset by lower interest income as a result of lower average investments in fixed maturity securities. Dividend income increased $60 million (1.7%) in 2018 as compared to 2017, reflecting the impact of increased investments in marketable equity securities and higher dividend rates on common stock holdings, partially offset by Restaurant Brands International’s redemption of our $3 billion investment in 9% preferred stock in December 2017. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, less insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $129 billion at December 31, 2019, $123 billion at December 31, 2018 and $114 billion at December 31, 2017. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $417 million in 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2018, and consequently, the average cost of float for each of those periods was negative. Pre-tax underwriting losses were approximately $3.2 billion in 2017 and our average cost of float in 2017 was approximately 3.0%.

Foreign government securities include obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by national or provincial government entities. Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major business groups by type of product shipped. These business groups include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Revenues $ 23,515 $ 23,855 $ 21,387 Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 5,347 5,394 5,023 Fuel 2,944 3,346 2,518 Purchased services 2,700 2,870 2,514 Depreciation and amortization 2,403 2,317 2,352 Equipment rents, materials and other 1,801 2,024 1,636 Total operating expenses 15,195 15,951 14,043 Interest expense 1,070 1,041 1,016 16,265 16,992 15,059 Pre-tax earnings 7,250 6,863 6,328 Income taxes 1,769 1,644 2,369 Net earnings $ 5,481 $ 5,219 $ 3,959 Effective income tax rate 24.4 % 24.0 % 37.4 % 2019 versus 2018 BNSF’s revenues were $23.5 billion in 2019, a decrease of $340 million (1.4%) versus 2018. During 2019, BNSF’s revenues reflected a 3.6% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit and a 4.5% decrease in volume. Volume was 10.2 million cars/units compared to 10.7 million in 2018. The increase in average revenue per car/unit was attributable to increased rates per car/unit and a favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing. Pre-tax earnings in 2019 were approximately $7.3 billion, an increase of 5.6% over 2018. BNSF experienced severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network, which negatively affected revenues, expenses and service levels. In addition to the impact of an increase in average revenue per car/unit, BNSF's earnings in 2019 benefitted from a reduction in total operating expenses. K-40 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Revenues from consumer products were $7.9 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.5% compared to 2018, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit and volume decreases of 4.6%. The volume decreases were driven by moderated demand and the availability of truck capacity, as well as lower west coast imports. Revenues from industrial products were $6.1 billion in 2019, an increase of 1.7% from 2018. The increase was attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 3.0%. Volumes decreased primarily due to overall softness in the industrial sector, lower sand volumes, and reduced car loadings due to the challenging weather conditions in 2019. Strength in the energy sector, which drove higher demand for petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gas, partially offset the decreases in volumes. Revenues from agricultural products decreased 0.3% in 2019 to $4.7 billion compared to 2018. The decrease was due to lower volumes of 5.1% and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were attributable to export competition from non-U.S. sources, the impacts of international trade policies, and the challenging weather conditions in 2019. Revenues from coal decreased 7.4% in 2019 to $3.7 billion compared to 2018. This decrease reflected lower average revenue per car/unit and lower volumes of 5.3%. Volumes were negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions, as well as from the effects of lower natural gas prices. Operating expenses were $15.2 billion in 2019, a decrease of $756 million (4.7%) compared to 2018. Our ratio of operating expenses to revenues decreased 2.3 percentage points to 64.6% in 2019 versus 2018. BNSF's expenses in 2019 reflected lower volume-related costs, lower fuel prices, the effects of cost control initiatives, and a retirement plan curtailment gain, partially offset by the costs associated with the adverse weather conditions. Fuel expenses decreased $402 million (12.0%) compared to 2018, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes, and improved fuel efficiency. Purchased services expense decreased $170 million (5.9%) compared to 2018. The decrease was due to lower purchased transportation costs of our logistics services business, lower drayage, lower services expense, and higher insurance recoveries. Equipment rents, materials and other expense decreased $223 million (11.0%) compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a $120 million curtailment gain from the amendment to the company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans, as well as from lower locomotive and various other costs associated with lower volumes and cost controls. BNSF’s effective income tax rate was 24.4% in 2019, 24.0% in 2018 and 37.4% in 2017. The rate in 2017 excluded the effects of the TCJA, which reduced the U.S. statutory income tax rate. 2018 versus 2017 BNSF’s revenues were $23.9 billion in 2018, an increase of $2.5 billion (11.5%) over 2017. BNSF’s revenues in 2018 reflected a 6.2% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit and a 4.1% increase in volume. Combined volume was 10.7 million cars/units compared to 10.3 million in 2017. The increase in average revenue per car/unit was attributable to increased rates per car/unit, higher fuel surcharge revenue driven by higher fuel prices, and business mix changes. Pre-tax earnings were approximately $6.9 billion in 2018, an increase of 8.5% compared to 2017. Revenues from consumer products were $7.9 billion in 2018, an increase of 11.1% compared to 2017, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit and volume increases of 2.9%. The volume increases were due to higher domestic intermodal volumes, as well as growth in imports and containerized agricultural product exports, partially offset by a sizable contract loss. Revenues from industrial products were $6.0 billion in 2018, an increase of 16.2% from 2017. The increase was attributable to volume increases of 9.8% as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes in 2018 increased for petroleum products, building products, construction products, and plastics. Revenues from agricultural products increased 8.8% in 2018 to $4.7 billion compared to 2017. The increase was due to higher volumes of 9.0%, partially offset by slightly lower average revenue per car/unit. Volumes increased due to strong export and domestic corn shipments, as well as higher fertilizer and other grain products volumes, partially offset by a reduction in soybean and wheat exports. Revenues from coal in 2018 increased 4.3% to $4.0 billion compared to 2017, attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by lower volumes of 0.8%. The volume decrease in 2018 was due mainly to utility plant retirements combined with competition from natural gas and renewables, mostly offset by market share gains and increased export volumes. K-41 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Total operating expenses were $16.0 billion in 2018, an increase of $1.9 billion (13.6%) compared to 2017. Our ratio of operating expenses to revenues increased 1.2 percentage points to 66.9% in 2018 versus 2017. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $371 million (7.4%) compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to wage inflation and increased headcount and associated training costs. Fuel expenses increased $828 million (32.9%) compared to 2017 primarily due to higher average fuel prices and increased volumes. Purchased services expense increased $356 million (14.2%) compared to 2017, due to higher purchased transportation costs of our logistics services business, as well as increased intermodal ramping, drayage, and other volume-related costs. Equipment rents, materials and other expense increased $388 million (23.7%) compared to 2017, reflecting higher locomotive material expenses, personal injury expenses, derailment-related costs, and property taxes, as well as the impact of a benefit in 2017 from the enactment of the TCJA on an equity method investee. Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) We currently own 90.9% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects. BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent these regulated operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. The TCJA reduced the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In 2018, BHE’s regulated subsidiaries began passing the benefits of lower income tax expense attributable to the TCJA to customers through various regulatory mechanisms, including lower rates, higher depreciation and reductions to rate base. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 15,371 $ 15,573 $ 15,171 Real estate operating revenue 4,473 4,214 3,443 Other income 270 200 240 Total revenue 20,114 19,987 18,854 Costs and expense: Energy cost of sales 4,586 4,769 4,518 Energy operating expense 6,824 6,969 6,354 Real estate operating costs and expense 4,251 4,000 3,229 Interest expense 1,835 1,777 2,254 Total costs and expense 17,496 17,515 16,355 Pre-tax earnings 2,618 2,472 2,499 Income tax expense (benefit)* (526 ) (452 ) 148 Net earnings after income taxes 3,144 2,924 2,351 Noncontrolling interests 18 23 40 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway Energy 3,126 2,901 2,311 Noncontrolling interests 286 280 278 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 2,840 $ 2,621 $ 2,033 Effective income tax rate (20.1 )% (18.3 )% 5.9 % *Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation. K-42 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) The discussion of BHE’s operating results that follows is based on after-tax earnings, reflecting how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated. A summary of net earnings attributable to BHE follows (in millions). 2019 2018 2017 PacifiCorp $ 773 $ 739 $ 763 MidAmerican Energy Company 781 669 597 NV Energy 365 317 365 Northern Powergrid 256 239 251 Natural gas pipelines 422 387 270 Other energy businesses 608 489 404 Real estate brokerage 160 145 118 Corporate interest and other (239 ) (84 ) (457 ) $ 3,126 $ 2,901 $ 2,311 PacifiCorp PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. Net earnings after income taxes were $773 million in 2019, an increase of $34 million (4.6%) compared to 2018, reflecting slightly higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and higher other income, partly offset by higher depreciation expense from additional plant-in-service. Utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $4 million compared to 2018, as higher retail revenue from a 0.4% increase in retail customer volumes, in part due to the favorable impact of weather, was largely offset by lower wholesale revenue mainly due to lower volumes. Net earnings after income taxes decreased $24 million (3.1%) in 2018 as compared to 2017. The change in after-tax earnings reflected the unfavorable utility margin and higher operating expenses, partly offset by higher other income. Utility margin in 2018 was $3.3 billion, a decrease of $198 million (6%) versus 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a $197 million decline in retail revenues from the effects of lower average rates of $180 million (including the impact of the TCJA of $152 million) and a reduction in volumes (0.2%), largely attributable to the impacts of weather. MidAmerican Energy Company MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. Net earnings after income taxes of $781 million in 2019 increased $112 million (16.7%) as compared to 2018, primarily attributable to increases in electric utility margin, income tax benefits from higher production tax credits and the effects of ratemaking, and other income. Electric utility margin in 2019 increased 2% to $1.8 billion, primarily due to higher wind generation and higher retail customer volumes of 1.4%, as an increase in industrial volumes of 4.0% was largely offset by lower residential volumes from the unfavorable impact of weather. These earnings increases were partially offset by increased depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service (net of lower Iowa revenue sharing) and higher net interest expense. Net earnings after income taxes were $669 million in 2018, an increase of $72 million (12.1%) compared to 2017, reflecting higher electric utility margin, higher depreciation and operating expenses and higher income tax benefits, partly due to higher production tax credits. Electric utility margin was $1.8 billion in 2018, an increase of $122 million (7%) compared to 2017, which was primarily due to higher retail revenues of $102 million, reflecting higher recoveries through bill riders and volumes, partially offset by lower rates, predominantly from the impact of the TCJA. The increase in depreciation expense included $65 million from additional wind generation and other plant placed in-service and $44 million from Iowa revenue sharing. NV Energy NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. Net earnings after income taxes were $365 million in 2019, an increase of $48 million (15.1%) compared to 2018, as lower operating expenses were partly offset by lower electric utility margin. Electric utility margin in 2019 was $1.6 billion, representing a decrease of $58 million (3%) versus 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.4% decline in retail customer volumes, largely attributable to the impacts of weather, and rate reductions from the impact of the TCJA, partially offset by retail customer growth. Net earnings after income taxes decreased $48 million (13.2%) in 2018 as compared to 2017, reflecting lower electric utility margin and increased depreciation and operating expenses. Electric utility margin decreased $52 million in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to the effects of the TCJA, partially offset by higher retail sales volumes. K-43 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) Northern Powergrid Net earnings after income taxes increased 7.1% in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting higher distribution revenues and lower operating expenses, which were largely from lower pension settlement losses in 2019, partially offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a strong average U.S. Dollar ($10 million). Distribution revenues increased $18 million, attributable to higher tariff rates, partly offset by lower distributed units. Net earnings after income taxes were $239 million in 2018, a decrease of $12 million (4.8%) compared to 2017, reflecting higher distribution revenues, increased depreciation and operating expenses, including higher pension settlement losses, and a $9 million increase from the effects of a weaker U.S. Dollar. Natural gas pipelines Net earnings after income taxes increased $35 million (9.0%) in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher transportation revenues from generally higher volumes and rates, favorable margins from system balancing activities and a decrease in operating expenses, partly offset by higher depreciation expense due to increased spending on capital projects. Net earnings after income taxes were $387 million in 2018, a 43.3% increase ($117 million) compared to 2017, reflecting higher transportation revenues from higher volumes and rates due to unique market opportunities and colder average temperatures, lower depreciation expense and a comparative increase in operating expenses. Other energy businesses Net earnings after income taxes in 2019 were $608 million, an increase of $119 million (24.3%) compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to improved earnings from renewable wind energy projects ($49 million from tax equity investments and $25 million from new and existing projects and activities), higher after-tax income from geothermal and natural gas units of $53 million, largely due to higher generation and favorable margins and lower operating expenses, partly offset by lower earnings at a hydroelectric facility in the Philippines due to lower rainfall. The increase in earnings also reflected the effects of favorable regulatory decisions received in 2019 and the unfavorable impacts of a regulatory rate order received in 2018 at AltaLink L.P. Net earnings after income taxes increased $85 million (21.0%) in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting increased revenues from existing renewable energy projects from overall higher generation and pricing, increased earnings from wind tax equity investments of $34 million and earnings from additional wind and solar capacity placed in-service, partially offset by higher operating expenses at existing projects. Real estate brokerage Net earnings after income taxes increased 10.3% in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher after-tax earnings at existing mortgage businesses due to increased refinance activity and earnings attributable to recent business acquisitions, partially offset by lower after-tax earnings at existing brokerage businesses, primarily from lower units and margins. Net earnings after income taxes were $145 million in 2018, an increase of $27 million (22.9%) compared to 2017. The increase reflected earnings from acquired businesses, higher comparative operating expenses and lower margins at existing businesses and lower income tax expense due to the impact of the TCJA. Corporate interest and other Net earnings after income taxes decreased $155 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to income tax benefits recognized in 2018 related to the reduction of accrued repatriation taxes on undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the TCJA, higher corporate interest and lower after-tax earnings from non-regulated energy services. Net earnings after income taxes increased $373 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to an after-tax charge of $246 million recognized in 2017 from a tender offer completed in December 2017 to redeem certain long-term debt of BHE and the TCJA income tax benefits recognized in 2018. K-44 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Revenues Earnings * 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Manufacturing $ 62,730 $ 61,883 $ 57,645 $ 9,522 $ 9,366 $ 8,324 Service and retailing 79,945 78,926 76,994 2,843 2,942 2,603 $ 142,675 $ 140,809 $ 134,639 Pre-tax earnings 12,365 12,308 10,927 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 2,993 2,944 3,645 $ 9,372 $ 9,364 $ 7,282 Effective income tax rate 23.7 % 23.4 % 32.8 % * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which primarily related to the amortization of identified intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings above were $788 million in 2019, $932 million in 2018 and $937 million in 2017. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page K-32 and in the “Other” earnings section on page K-53. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. Industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International (“CTB”)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products (“LSPI”)). Marmon also provides various products and services (including equipment leasing) for the rail, intermodal container and mobile crane industries. The building products group includes homebuilding and manufactured housing finance (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore), and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Industrial products $ 30,594 $ 30,679 $ 28,566 $ 5,635 $ 5,822 $ 5,065 Building products 20,327 18,677 16,946 2,636 2,336 2,147 Consumer products 11,809 12,527 12,133 1,251 1,208 1,112 $ 62,730 $ 61,883 $ 57,645 $ 9,522 $ 9,366 $ 8,324 K-45 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products 2019 versus 2018 Revenues of the industrial products group were $30.6 billion in 2019, a slight decrease from 2018. Pre-tax earnings of the group were $5.6 billion in 2019 compared to $5.8 billion in 2018. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 18.4% in 2019 compared to 19.0% in 2018. PCC’s revenues were $10.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $74 million (0.7%) compared to 2018. PCC experienced increased sales in aerospace markets, which was partially offset by lower sales in the power markets compared to 2018. The increase in aerospace sales was tempered due to significant efforts focused on the ramp-up requirements for certain new aerospace programs, such as LEAP, that created manufacturing inefficiencies and slowed production cycles contributing to delays in product deliveries and sales. While we expect that Boeing’s decision to suspend production of its 737 MAX aircraft may reduce demand for certain of our aerospace products in 2020, we also anticipate a significant portion of this volume reduction will be offset by incremental volume for other programs. We are also seeing stabilization in demand for our industrial gas turbine products within the power markets after two years of declines. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 5.1% in 2019 compared to 2018. The earnings increase reflected increased sales of aerospace products and higher earnings from various non-recurring items in 2019, which was partially offset by lower earnings from the power markets due to the decrease in sales. Temporary unplanned shutdowns of certain metals facilities and metal press outages also negatively impacted earnings in 2018. PCC continues to incur incremental costs to meet required deliveries to customers associated with the increased aerospace demand, which negatively affected margins and earnings. The production headwinds experienced were primarily attributable to shortages of qualified skilled labor and the rapid increase in requirements for newer, complex aerospace products. PCC implemented certain measures and intends to implement additional measures to address these issues and improve manufacturing efficiencies. Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2019, a decrease of $354 million (5.2%) compared to 2018. The decline reflected lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by higher average selling prices which were necessitated by raw material cost increases in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. A fire at Lubrizol’s Rouen, France manufacturing, blending and storage facility on September 26, 2019 resulted in the suspension of operations, which contributed significantly to the decline in Additives volumes. Those operations partially restarted in December 2019. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume in 2019 declined 4% from 2018, primarily due to volume decline of 6% in the Additives product lines. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2019 for the fourth quarter and year decreased 50.5% and 14.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018. Earnings in 2019 were significantly impacted by costs and lost business associated with the Rouen fire. Lubrizol’s operating results in 2019 were also negatively affected by lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by improved material margins. Marmon’s revenues were $8.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $146 million (1.8%) compared to 2018. The revenue increase reflected the effects of business acquisitions over the past year, higher volumes in several business sectors, which were largely offset by lower distribution volumes in the Metals Services sector, unfavorable foreign currency translation, and the impact of lower metal prices in the Electrical and Plumbing & Refrigeration sectors. Marmon’s business acquisitions included the acquisition of the Colson Medical companies on October 31, 2019, resulting in a new Medical sector. Marmon’s Rail & Leasing and Crane Services sectors benefitted from higher railcar equipment sales, railcar fleet utilization, railcar repair services, intermodal container leasing revenue and improved crane rental demand in the U.S. and Australia. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2019 increased $12 million (1.0%) as compared to 2018. The earnings increase reflected the effects of business acquisitions, partly offset by lower gains from business divestitures. Earnings in 2019 also reflected increased earnings in several sectors that experienced sales volume increases, which were substantially offset by lower earnings in the Metal Services and certain other sectors, the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency translation and increased interest and other expenses. IMC’s revenues in 2019 declined 1.3% in 2019 as compared to 2018, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower sales in several regions, including Asia and Europe, mostly offset by increased revenues from recent business acquisitions. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 12.8% in 2019 versus 2018, attributable to unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, changes in business mix to lower margin items and the effects of the U.S./China trade disputes. K-46 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) CTB’s revenues decreased 1.5% in 2019 versus 2018. The comparative decline was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower revenues from grain and protein equipment, partly offset by higher revenues from processing systems. CTB’s pre-tax earnings increased 11.7% in 2019 as compared to 2018. Earnings in 2019 benefitted from a combination of favorable changes in business mix, the moderation of cost increases of certain raw materials and better pricing efficiency. 2018 versus 2017 Revenues from industrial products businesses were approximately $30.7 billion in 2018, an increase of approximately $2.1 billion (7.4%) compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings of the industrial products group were approximately $5.8 billion in 2018, an increase of $757 million (14.9%) compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 19.0% in 2018 and 17.7% in 2017. The comparative earnings increase was partially attributable to certain one-time charges at PCC and Lubrizol in 2017. PCC’s revenues in 2018 were $10.2 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to 2017, which reflected increased demand in aerospace markets in connection with new aircraft programs, partly offset by lower demand for industrial gas turbine products. In addition, PCC experienced lower sales of certain pipe products in 2018, primarily attributable to the U.S tariffs. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 16.0% in 2018 compared to 2017. PCC’s earnings in 2017 included certain one-time inventory and impairment charges of $272 million. Results in 2018 were negatively affected by costs associated with the temporary unplanned shut-down of certain metals facilities, metal press outages and lower earnings from the industrial gas turbine business. The facilities that were shut-down gradually resumed production and were approximately 80% operational at the end of 2018. In addition, the new aircraft programs involve relatively complex manufacturing processes, negatively affecting earnings. Lubrizol’s revenues in 2018 were $6.8 billion, an increase of 5.9% compared to 2017 due to higher average sales prices, favorable changes in product mix and foreign currency translation effects, and a 2% increase in aggregate unit volumes. Lubrizol experienced significant increases in average material unit costs during 2018 and 2017, necessitating increases in sales prices. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume included increases in the Advanced Materials (5%) and the Additives (1%) product lines. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2018 increased 43.5% compared to 2017, which included pre-tax losses of approximately $190 million related to Lubrizol’s disposition of an underperforming bolt-on business and related intangible asset impairments and restructuring charges. Before such charges, Lubrizol’s earnings increased 17%, reflecting the previously mentioned increases in sales volumes and selling prices, as well as lower other restructuring charges, lower net interest expense, and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and ongoing expense control efforts, partly offset by higher raw material costs. Marmon’s revenues in 2018 were $8.2 billion, an increase of 5.5% as compared to 2017. The revenue increase was primarily attributable to volume increases in the Transportation Products sector, higher average metals prices, and the effects of business acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by revenue decreases in the Beverage Technologies and Rail Products and Services sectors. Rail Products and Services sector revenues also decreased due to lower railcar lease revenues, partly offset by increased railcar equipment sales and repair services. Throughout 2018, the railcar leasing business experienced the negative effects of lower lease renewal rates for railcars versus the rates on expiring leases. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2018 decreased 5.6% compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower pre-tax earnings from the Rail Products and Services sector ($126 million) and the Foodservice Technologies and Retail Solutions sectors ($33 million), partially offset by increased earnings from the Transportation Products sector and a gain in 2018 from the sale of certain assets of the Beverage Technologies sector of $44 million. The Rail Products and Services earnings decline was attributable to lower railcar leasing revenues and higher lease fleet repair costs. IMC’s revenues increased 16.1% in 2018 compared to 2017, due to a combination of factors, including higher unit sales, the effects of business acquisitions, and foreign currency translation effects from a weaker average U.S. Dollar in the first half of 2018. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased significantly in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting a combination of higher sales, increased manufacturing efficiencies, the effects of business acquisitions and ongoing expense control efforts, partly offset by higher raw material costs. CTB’s revenues increased 4.0% in 2018 versus 2017, due to favorable foreign currency translation effects and modest sales growth in protein production and processing systems. CTB’s pre-tax earnings in 2018 were lower than 2017, primarily due to lower gross sales margins attributable to raw material cost increases and higher other operating expenses. K-47 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products 2019 versus 2018 Revenues of the building products group were $20.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.65 billion (8.8%) compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings of the group were $2.6 billion in 2019, an increase of 12.8% over 2018. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.0% and 12.5% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $7.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.3 billion (21.5%) over 2018. The comparative increase was primarily due to increases in home sales of $1.16 billion (26%), reflecting a net increase in units sold and changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 84% in 2019 over 2018, primarily due to business acquisitions, while average prices declined 5%. Manufactured home unit sales increased 5% and wholesale sales were 9% lower in 2019. Interest income from lending activities in 2019 increased 6.7% compared to 2018, attributable to increased originations and average outstanding loan balances. Aggregate loan balances outstanding were approximately $15.9 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $14.7 billion as of December 31, 2018. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $1.1 billion in 2019, an increase of $182 million (20.0%) compared to 2018. The earnings increase in 2019 was attributable to home building activities, which reflected the increases in home sales, and manufactured housing lending activities. Pre-tax earnings from lending and finance activities in 2019 increased 12%, primarily due to an increase in interest income attributable to higher average loan balances, increased other financial services earnings and lower credit losses, partially offset by higher interest expense, attributable to higher average borrowings and interest rates, and by higher other operating costs. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were $13.0 billion in 2019, an increase of 2.8% versus 2018. Revenues increased for paint and coatings, hard surface flooring and roofing products, attributable to a combination of increased volumes, product mix changes and increased average selling prices, while sales of brick products declined, primarily attributable to lower volumes. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were $1.5 billion in 2019, an increase of 8.2% over 2018. Earnings in 2019 benefitted from a combination of increases in selling prices in certain product categories, declining raw material costs for certain commodities and operating cost control initiatives, which were partly offset by the effects of increased facilities closure costs. 2018 versus 2017 Revenues of the building products group in 2018 were approximately $18.7 billion, an increase of 10.2% compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings of the building products group were approximately $2.3 billion in 2018, an increase of 8.8% versus 2017. Overall, pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 12.5% in 2018 and 12.7% in 2017. Clayton Homes’ revenues were $6.0 billion in 2018, an increase of 20.7% over 2017. The increase was driven by an increase in revenues from home sales of $971 million (28.2%), primarily due to a 105% increase in unit sales of site-built homes attributable to businesses acquired over the last two years. Unit sales of manufactured homes in 2018 also increased 4.9% compared to 2017. Average unit prices of site-built homes are considerably higher than traditional manufactured homes. In addition, interest income from lending activities increased 4% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to increased average outstanding loan balances. Clayton Homes’ pre-tax earnings were $911 million in 2018, an increase of $145 million (19.0%) compared to 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a significant increase in earnings from home building (manufactured housing and site-built homes) activities, which reflected the impact of increased home sales and margins. Pre-tax earnings from lending activities in 2018 declined 2% compared to 2017, as increased interest expense, attributable to higher average debt balances and interest rates, and higher operating costs more than offset the increase in interest income. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, aggregate loan balances outstanding were approximately $14.7 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively. Revenues of our other building products businesses increased 5.8% in 2018 to approximately $12.6 billion compared to 2017. In 2018, Shaw’s sales increased 7.9% and Johns Manville’s sales increased 7.2% as compared to 2017. The increases reflected higher average selling prices, product mix changes and overall unit volume increases. K-48 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) Raw material and production costs in 2018 of our building products businesses were generally higher than in 2017. For instance, steel, titanium dioxide and petrochemicals costs were substantially higher in 2018 than in 2017, as were product delivery costs, due in part to the shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. These cost increases precipitated sales price increases, although such increases lagged the increases in raw materials costs. Consumer products 2019 versus 2018 Consumer products revenues were $11.8 billion in 2019, a decrease of $718 million (5.7%) versus 2018. Revenues of Forest River declined 12.9% versus 2018, primarily due to lower unit sales. Revenues of Duracell increased 1.3% and apparel and footwear revenues declined 1.1% compared to 2018. Despite a comparative revenue increase of 3.5% in 2019, Brooks Sports operating results were negatively affected by lost sales associated with problems encountered at a distribution center that opened in the second quarter. In addition, our other apparel and other footwear businesses continue to experience lower sales volumes for certain products, reflecting the shift by major retailers towards private label products. Consumer products pre-tax earnings were $1.25 billion in 2019, an increase of 3.6% compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 10.6% in 2019 and 9.6% in 2018. The increase in pre-tax earnings was primarily attributable to continuing cost containment efforts across several of the businesses and the effects of a new Duracell product launch, partially offset by the impact of lower recreational vehicle sales at Forest River. 2018 versus 2017 Consumer products revenues were approximately $12.5 billion in 2018, an increase of 3.2% compared to 2017, which was primarily due to revenue increases at Forest River and at our apparel and footwear businesses. Forest River’s revenues increased 2.6% in 2018, reflecting relatively unchanged unit sales versus 2017. However, over the second half of the year, comparative sales at Forest River declined 5%, reflecting a 7% decline in units sold. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 4.6% to approximately $4.3 billion, primarily due to increased sales volume at Brooks Sports and Garan. Pre-tax earnings were $1.2 billion in 2018, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 9.6% in 2018 and 9.2% in 2017. The increase in earnings reflected increases from Duracell and the apparel and footwear businesses, partly offset by lower earnings from Forest River and Larson Juhl. Forest River’s pre-tax earnings declined 9.0% compared to 2017. Operating results were adversely affected over the second half of 2018, and in the fourth quarter in particular, by higher material costs, which, together with the effects of lower sales volumes, contributed to a 28% reduction in fourth quarter pre-tax earnings. Pre-tax earnings of the apparel and footwear businesses increased 6.4% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily attributable to the overall increase in revenues and sales mix changes. Duracell’s pre-tax earnings increased in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting the favorable effects of ongoing operational improvement efforts and a comparative decline in restructuring charges. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Service $ 13,496 $ 13,333 $ 12,155 $ 1,681 $ 1,836 $ 1,519 Retailing 15,991 15,606 15,064 874 860 785 McLane Company 50,458 49,987 49,775 288 246 299 $ 79,945 $ 78,926 $ 76,994 $ 2,843 $ 2,942 $ 2,603 K-49 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service Our service business group offers fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI) and franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire), publication of newspapers and other publications (Buffalo News and the BH Media Group) and operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). We also offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). 2019 versus 2018 Service group revenues were $13.5 billion in 2019, an increase of 1.2% compared to 2018. Sales of TTI increased 2% in 2019 compared to the exceptionally high sales levels in 2018. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and foreign currency, TTI’s sales in 2019 were relatively unchanged from 2018. TTI’s sales began to slow in the fourth quarter of 2018 and continued to slow throughout 2019, attributable to softening customer demand, lower sales prices and the effects of U.S. trade tariffs. Service group revenues in 2019 also reflected increases in aviation-related services (NetJets and to a lesser extent FlightSafety) and the leasing businesses, and decreases from the media businesses and Charter Brokerage, which divested a high revenue, low margin business in mid-2019. The increase in NetJets revenues in 2019 reflected increased lease revenue, primarily attributable to an increase in aircraft on lease and increased flight hours, partly offset by lower revenue from prepaid flight cards. Pre-tax earnings of the service group were $1.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of $155 million (8.4%) compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 12.5% in 2019 compared to 13.8% in 2018. The comparative declines in earnings in 2019 were primarily due to lower earnings from TTI and FlightSafety, partly offset by higher earnings from NetJets. TTI’s earnings decline was attributable to lower gross margin, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and higher operating expenses, partly offset by earnings from businesses acquired. FlightSafety’s earnings decline was attributable to significant losses related to an existing government contract that were recorded in the fourth quarter, partly offset by lower training equipment impairment charges. Earnings from NetJets increased in 2019, primarily attributable to increased revenues and improved fleet and operating efficiencies, which improved operating margins. 2018 versus 2017 Revenues of the service group were approximately $13.3 billion in 2018, an increase of approximately 9.7% compared to 2017. TTI’s revenues increased approximately 33.7% compared to 2017, reflecting industry-wide increases in demand for electronic components in many geographic markets around the world, the effects of recent business acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation effects. While TTI’s revenue increase in 2018 was significant, revenue growth began to moderate in the fourth quarter, in part attributable to the impact of U.S. trade tariffs. WPLG generated a revenue increase of 20.8% in 2018 over 2017, primarily due to increased political advertising revenue. Revenues of Charter Brokerage increased 53.3%, reflecting increased fees earned and product mix changes. Revenues of the CORT and XTRA leasing businesses increased 8.4% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to increased over-the road trailer units on lease and increased furniture rental income. Pre-tax earnings of the service group in 2018 were approximately $1.8 billion, an increase of 20.9% compared to 2017. The comparative earnings increase was primarily due to TTI, which accounted for almost 84% of the increase. The earnings increase of TTI was primarily due to the effects of the sales volume increases. In addition, XTRA, Charter Brokerage and NetJets each generated increased earnings in 2018 compared to 2017. The increases in earnings of these businesses were partly offset by lower earnings at FlightSafety, primarily due to reduced margins from sales of flight simulators and training equipment impairment charges. Retailing Our retailers include Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”). BHA includes over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. K-50 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories. 2019 versus 2018 Retailing group revenues were $16.0 billion in 2019, an increase of 2.5% compared to 2018. BHA’s revenues in 2019, which represented approximately 64% of our retailing revenues, increased 4.1% over 2018. BHA’s revenue increase reflected an 11.5% increase in pre-owned vehicle sales, vehicle pricing increases, improvement in vehicle finance and service contract activities and vehicle repair work as compared to 2018. New vehicle sales in 2019 were relatively unchanged from 2018. Home furnishings group revenues, which represented about 20% of the aggregate retailing group revenues, declined 1.3% in 2019 compared to 2018. Sales in 2019 were relatively unchanged or lower in each of our home furnishings operations. Retail group pre-tax earnings were $874 million in 2019, an increase of 1.6% over 2018. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 22.7%, primarily due to the increases in earnings from finance and service contract activities, partly offset by higher floorplan interest expense. Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings declined 14.7% versus 2018, reflecting the decline in revenues and generally higher operating expenses. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group declined 7.9% compared to 2018. 2018 versus 2017 Revenues of the retailing group were approximately $15.6 billion in 2018, an increase of 3.6% compared to 2017. BHA’s revenues, which represented approximately 63% of the aggregate retailing revenues, increased 4.0% as compared to 2017. The increase derived primarily from increased pre-owned vehicle sales and service contract revenues. Revenues from new vehicle sales were relatively unchanged. Louis revenues increased 7.8% in 2018 versus 2017, primarily due to the translation effects of a weaker average U.S. Dollar. Home furnishings revenues increased 4.7% in 2018 over 2017, reflecting increased sales in certain geographic markets and the effect of a new store. Pre-tax earnings of the retailing group were $860 million in 2018, an increase of 9.6% over 2017. The earnings increase included higher earnings from BHA and Louis, partly offset by lower earnings from the home furnishings retailers. The earnings increase of BHA was primarily from finance and service contract activities, partly offset by higher floorplan interest expense. The earnings increase at Louis reflected the revenue increase and an increase in its operating margin rate. Earnings of the home furnishings businesses declined 2.4% in 2018 compared to 2017, partly due to increased inventory liquidation, delivery and occupancy costs at Star Furniture. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised approximately 66% of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2019 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues were $50.5 billion in 2019, an increase of 0.9% compared to 2018. McLane operates on 52/53-week fiscal year and 2019 included an extra week compared to 2018. Otherwise, revenues in 2019 decreased roughly 3% in the grocery business and increased 3% in the foodservice business as compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings increased $42 million (17.1%) as compared to 2018. The earnings increase in 2019 reflected an increase in average gross margin rates and changes in business mix, partly offset by increased operating expenses, the largest portion of which were employee costs. McLane continues to operate in an intensely competitive business environment, which is negatively affecting its current operating results. We expect these operating conditions will continue. K-51 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) McLane Company (Continued) Revenues were approximately $50.0 billion in 2018, slightly higher than 2017, reflecting a slight increase in grocery sales (1%) and a slight decrease in foodservice sales (1%). The decline in foodservice revenues was primarily due to a net loss of customers. Pre-tax earnings were $246 million, a decline of 17.7%, compared to 2017. McLane’s grocery and foodservice businesses continue to operate in a highly competitive business environment, which negatively affected operating results. While gross margin rates increased slightly over 2018, increases in fuel, depreciation and certain other operating expenses more than offset the increase, producing a decline in pre-tax earnings compared to 2017. Investment and Derivative Gains (Losses) A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses follows (dollars in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Investment gains (losses) $ 71,123 $ (22,155 ) $ 1,410 Derivative gains (losses) 1,484 (300 ) 718 Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 72,607 (22,455 ) 2,128 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 15,162 (4,718 ) 751 Net gains (losses) $ 57,445 $ (17,737 ) $ 1,377 Effective income tax rate 20.9 % 20.8 % 34.9 % Investment gains (losses) Due to a new accounting pronouncement adopted as of January 1, 2018, pre-tax investment gains/losses reported in earnings include unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices on investments in equity securities. Prior to 2018, investment gains/losses related to equity securities were generally recorded as the securities were sold, redeemed or exchanged based on the cost of the disposed securities and the unrealized gains and losses were recorded in other comprehensive income. While the new accounting pronouncement does not affect our consolidated shareholders’ equity or total comprehensive income, it has significantly increased the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Investment gains and losses from periodic changes in securities prices will continue to cause significant volatility in our consolidated earnings. Pre-tax investment gains included net unrealized gains of approximately $69.6 billion in 2019 attributable to equity securities we held at December 31, 2019. By comparison, we recorded pre-tax investment losses of approximately $22.7 billion in 2018 attributable to unrealized losses with respect to the equity securities we held at December 31, 2018. Pre-tax net unrealized gains on equity securities of approximately $29 billion in 2017 was recorded in other comprehensive income. Prior to 2018, investment gains/losses on equity securities were recorded when securities were sold based on the cost of the disposed securities. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold during the year, which is the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $3.2 billion in 2019 and $3.3 billion in 2018. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings, including the changes in market prices for equity securities, in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative gains (losses) Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. Substantially all remaining contracts will expire by February 2023. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant, primarily due to the volatility of underlying equity markets. As of December 31, 2019, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was $397 million and our recorded liability at fair value was $968 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. Contracts with an aggregate notional value of $12.3 billion expired in 2019. K-52 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains (Losses) (Continued) Derivative gains (losses) (Continued) Pre-tax gains from equity index put option contracts were $1.5 billion in 2019 compared to pre-tax losses of $300 million in 2018 and gains of $718 million in 2017. The gains in 2019 and 2017 reflected increases in the equity index values and shorter remaining contract durations while the losses in 2018 were primarily due to lower equity index values. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings (losses) follows (in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Equity method earnings (losses) $ 1,023 $ (1,419 ) $ 1,111 Acquisition accounting expenses (884 ) (1,111 ) (936 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (280 ) (311 ) (266 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes 58 289 (655 ) Income tax expense adjustment (377 ) — — Other, principally corporate investment income 884 986 261 Net earnings (losses) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 424 $ (1,566 ) $ (485 ) After-tax equity method earnings include Berkshire’s share of earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. After-tax equity method earnings related to our Kraft Heinz investment were earnings of $488 million in 2019, losses of $1,859 million in 2018 and earnings of $972 million in 2017. The after-tax equity method losses in 2018 included approximately $2.7 billion for our share of intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s outstanding Euro denominated debt (€6.85 billion par) and Japanese Yen denominated debt (¥430 billion par), issued in September 2019, and BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt (£1.75 billion par), issued in June 2019. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produced non-cash unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The income tax expense adjustment relates to investments that were made between 2015 and 2018 in certain tax equity investment funds. Our investments in these funds aggregated approximately $340 million. In December 2018 and during the first quarter of 2019, we learned of allegations by federal authorities of fraudulent conduct by the sponsor of these funds and in January 2020 the principals involved in creating the investment funds plead guilty to criminal charges related to the sale of the investments. As a result, we now believe that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefits that we recognized in prior years are not valid. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2019 was $424.8 billion, an increase of $76.1 billion since December 31, 2018. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in 2019 were $81.4 billion and included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $56.3 billion, which were primarily from increases in market prices of the equity securities we owned at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $125.0 billion, which included $101 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $266.7 billion. In August 2019, we paid $10 billion to acquire preferred stock and warrants of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, as discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. K-53 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 was $19.9 billion, an increase of $3.0 billion since December 31, 2018. In 2019, Berkshire repaid maturing senior notes of $750 million and issued ¥430 billion of senior notes (approximately $4.0 billion), which has a weighted average interest rate of 0.49% and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2049. In March 2020, Berkshire Euro debt of €1.0 billion will mature. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $17.7 billion at December 31, 2019, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $11.0 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our UTLX railcar leasing business. In 2019, BHFC repaid $3.95 billion of maturing senior notes and issued $2.0 billion of 4.25% senior notes due in 2049, £1.0 billion of 2.375% senior notes due in 2039 and £750 million of 2.625% senior notes due in 2059. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes. In 2020, BHFC debt of $900 million matures, including $350 million that matured in January. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of these two operations in 2019 were $11.0 billion and we forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $10.6 billion in 2020. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.2 billion as of December 31, 2019, relatively unchanged since December 31, 2018. In 2019, BNSF issued $825 million of 3.55% senior unsecured debentures due in 2050 and repaid $750 million of maturing debentures. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $42.6 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $3.3 billion since December 31, 2018. In 2019, BHE and its subsidiaries issued debt aggregating $4.6 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2029 to 2059 and repaid approximately $1.8 billion of maturing term debt. The proceeds from these financings were used to repay borrowings, fund capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes. In January 2020, a BHE subsidiary issued $725 million of term debt consisting of $425 million of 2.4% notes due in 2030 and $300 million of 3.125% notes due in 2050. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program was amended on July 17, 2018, permitting Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In 2019, Berkshire repurchased shares of Class A and B common stock for an aggregate cost of $5.0 billion. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the financial statements, will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. Beginning in 2019, operating lease obligations are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. The timing and amount of the payments under certain contracts, such as insurance and reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. K-54 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Contractual Obligations (Continued) A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 follows (in millions). Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table.

(2) Includes unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under retroactive reinsurance contracts. (3) Amounts represent estimated undiscounted benefits, net of estimated future premiums, as applicable. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2019 follows. Property and casualty losses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities and all techniques require significant judgments and assumptions. As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include provisions for reported claims, as well as claims not yet reported and the development of reported claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails. Our consolidated claim liabilities as of December 31, 2019 were approximately $115.5 billion (including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance), of which 84% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques of these businesses follows. GEICO GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December 31, 2019, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses were $22.0 billion. Claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable were $20.9 billion. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies. Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2019, case development liabilities averaged approximately 30% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities. K-55 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2018 increased $42 million during 2019, which produced a corresponding decrease to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2019 reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated. With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average severities will change by at least one percentage point from the severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2019. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $295 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through NICO and General Re. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2019 follows (in millions). Property Casualty Total Reported case liabilities $ 5,063 $ 9,665 $ 14,728 IBNR liabilities 4,631 12,825 17,456 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 9,694 22,490 32,184 Reinsurance recoverable 268 852 1,120 Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 9,426 $ 21,638 $ 31,064 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses in the table above consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of premium and loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information is often less detailed with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts. Additionally, loss information we receive through periodic reports is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR estimates to reinsurers. K-56 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. In the U.S., such reporting is generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. Reinsurers may assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, which may further delay the reporting of claims. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage, and for other reasons. As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain certain internal procedures in order to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s books and records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. We generally rely on the ceding companies reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2019, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $2.0 billion for certain legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates. Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, BHRG uses a variety of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data, and other benchmarks as appropriate. The estimate of the required IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories: Paid and incurred loss development methods – these methods consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns. Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods – these methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses. Frequency and severity methods – these methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses. Additional Analysis – in some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis, determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgement on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events. K-57 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications. In 2019, certain workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $150 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1 billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. We also reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ events for other casualty losses, excluding asbestos, environmental, and other latent injury claims, by $23 million, reflecting lower than expected reported losses. For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $850 million, although outcomes of less than $850 million are quite possible given the diversification in worldwide business. Estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims were increased approximately $150 million in 2019, which produced a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings. Net liabilities for such claims, excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. Retroactive reinsurance Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities relating to our retroactive reinsurance contracts are predominately related to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-tails to be very long. Our gross unpaid losses, deferred charge assets, and net liabilities at December 31, 2019 were as follows (in millions). Gross unpaid losses Deferred charges Liabilities, net of deferred charges $ 42,441 $ (13,747 ) $ 28,694 Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $56 billion. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our $42.4 billion estimated liability. We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expected results are revealed. K-58 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance (Continued) Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.9 billion at December 31, 2019. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect these claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities. We increased estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $378 million in 2019, which after the changes in related deferred charge assets, resulted in pre-tax losses of $125 million. In 2019, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $909 million with respect to these contracts. In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums. We amortize deferred charge assets, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances and the amount of periodic amortization. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2019, we currently estimate that amortization expense in 2020 will approximate $1.2 billion. Other Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $81.9 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $19.0 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2019. Our review of goodwill includes determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. Our review of other indefinite-lived intangible assets includes determining an estimated fair value of the asset. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then, as required by GAAP, the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. K-59 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Equity Price Risk Equity securities represent a significant portion of our investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2019, approximately 67% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in five issuers. We often hold our equity investments for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, fair values of these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contracts. The following table summarizes our equity securities and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions. Fair Value Hypothetical Price Change Estimated Fair Value after Hypothetical Change in Prices Hypothetical Percentage Increase (Decrease) in Shareholders’ Equity (1) December 31, 2019 Investments in equity securities $ 248,027 30% increase $ 319,445 13.3% 30% decrease 176,749 (13.3) Equity index put option contract liabilities 968 30% increase 267 0.1 30% decrease 2,776 (0.3) December 31, 2018 Investments in equity securities $ 172,757 30% increase $ 224,584 11.7% 30% decrease 120,930 (11.7) Equity index put option contract liabilities 2,452 30% increase 1,131 0.3 30% decrease 5,362 (0.7) (1) The hypothetical percentage increase (decrease) is after income taxes at the statutory rate in effect as of the balance sheet date. Interest Rate Risk We may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit ratings, in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. K-60 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Interest Rate Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2019 and 2018. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, such as The Coca-Cola Company, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and do not use derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risks in any meaningful way. Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and services subsidiaries. A portion of our financial statement translation-related impact from changes in foreign currency rates is recorded in other comprehensive income. In addition, we include gains or losses in net earnings related to certain liabilities of Berkshire and U.S. insurance subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies, due to changes in exchange rates. A summary of these gains (losses), after-tax, for each of the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018 follows (in millions). 2019 2018 Non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings $ 58 $ 289 Net liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts included in net earnings (92 ) 207 Foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income 257 (1,424 ) K-61 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Commodity Price Risk Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risks to any significant degree. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page K-63.

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 27 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. As the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated beginning in the second half of March, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe. Revenues and earnings of most of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter due to closures of facilities where crowds gather, such as retail stores, restaurants and entertainment venues as well as from public travel restrictions and from closures of certain of our businesses. In each of the third and fourth quarters of 2020, several of these businesses experienced significant increases in revenues and earnings as compared to the second quarter. Our businesses that were deemed essential continued to operate through the pandemic, including our railroad, utilities and energy, insurance and certain of our manufacturing, wholesale distribution and service businesses. In response to the effects of the pandemic, our businesses implemented various business continuity plans to protect our employees and customers. Such plans include a variety of actions, such as temporarily closing certain retail stores, manufacturing facilities and service centers of businesses that were not subject to government mandated closure. Our businesses also implemented practices to protect employees while at work. Such practices included work-from-home, staggered or reduced work schedules, increased cleaning and sanitation of workspaces, providing employee health screenings, eliminating non-essential travel and face-to-face meetings and providing general health reminders intended to lower the risk of spreading COVID-19. We also took actions in response to the economic losses from reductions in consumer demand for products and services we offer and our temporary inability to produce goods and provide services at certain of our businesses. These actions included employee furloughs, wage and salary reductions, capital spending reductions and other actions intended to help mitigate the economic losses and preserve capital and liquidity. Certain of our businesses undertook and may continue to undertake restructuring activities to resize their operations to better fit expected customer demand. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities at all of our numerous and diverse operations will normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $657 million in 2020, $325 million in 2019 and $1.6 billion in 2018. In each year, we generated underwriting earnings from primary insurance and underwriting losses from reinsurance. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $750 million in 2020, $800 million in 2019 and $1.3 billion in 2018. Underwriting results in 2020 also reflected the effects of the pandemic, arising from premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program, reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile insurance and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance and property and casualty reinsurance business. K-33 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Results of Operations (Continued) After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2020 declined $491 million (8.9%) versus 2019, reflecting lower interest income primarily attributable to declines in interest rates on our substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2019 increased 21.4% over 2018, attributable to increases in interest and dividend income. After-tax earnings of our railroad business decreased 5.8% in 2020 as compared to 2019. Earnings in 2020 reflected lower railroad operating revenues from lower shipping volumes, attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 8.8% as compared to 2019. The increase reflected increased tax benefits from renewable energy and increased earnings from the real estate brokerage business. Earnings in 2020 from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined 11.4% versus 2019. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic varied among our manufacturing businesses relative to significance and duration. Other earnings included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $11.0 billion in 2020, $435 million in 2019 and $3.0 billion in 2018. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Approximately $9.8 billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016. Other earnings in 2020 also included after-tax foreign exchange rate losses of $764 million related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 5.0% in 2019 compared to 2018. Earnings in 2019 benefitted from higher rates per car/unit, a curtailment gain related to an amendment to defined benefit retirement plans and ongoing operating cost control initiatives, partly offset by lower freight volumes and incremental costs associated with the persistent flooding conditions and severe winter weather in the first half of 2019. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 8.4% in 2019 compared to 2018. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2019 were relatively unchanged from 2018, reflecting mixed operating results with several of these businesses experiencing lower earnings in 2019 from a variety of factors. Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2019 of certain of these businesses were negatively affected by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar, international trade tensions and U.S. trade tariffs. Investment and derivative gains/losses in each of the three years presented included significant gains and losses on our investments in equity securities, including unrealized gains and losses from market price changes on securities we continue to hold. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating, based on our long-held strategy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider pre-tax losses in excess of $100 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $120.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. K-34 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Underwriting results in 2020 of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses were negatively affected by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including estimated provisions for claims and uncollectible premiums and incremental operating costs to maintain customer service levels. The effects of the pandemic in the future may be further affected by judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurance coverage and claims and by its effects on general economic activity, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss): GEICO $ 3,428 $ 1,506 $ 2,449 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 110 383 670 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (2,700 ) (1,472 ) (1,109 ) Pre-tax underwriting earnings 838 417 2,010 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 181 92 444 Net underwriting earnings $ 657 $ 325 $ 1,566 Effective income tax rate 21.5 % 24.2 % 21.4 % GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 34,928 $ 36,016 $ 34,123 Premiums earned $ 35,093 100.0 $ 35,572 100.0 $ 33,363 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 26,018 74.1 28,937 81.3 26,278 78.8 Underwriting expenses 5,647 16.1 5,129 14.5 4,636 13.9 Total losses and expenses 31,665 90.2 34,066 95.8 30,914 92.7 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 3,428 $ 1,506 $ 2,449 2020 versus 2019 GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings for 2020 reflected significant declines in losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to lower claims frequencies from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic offset by the effects of the GEICO Giveback program (see following paragraph) on earned premiums. Premiums written decreased 3.0% compared to 2019. The GEICO Giveback program provided for a 15% premium credit to all voluntary auto and motorcycle policies renewing between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020, as well as to any new policies written during the same period. The GEICO Giveback program reduced premiums written in 2020 by approximately $2.9 billion. Premiums earned decreased 1.3% in 2020 compared to 2019, which included reductions of approximately $2.5 billion attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. K-35 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Voluntary auto policies-in-force at the end of 2020 increased approximately 820,000 (4.6%) compared to the end of 2019. The increase reflected a 7.3% decrease in new business sales and a 2.5% decrease in non-renewals and policy cancellations. Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $2.9 billion (10.1%) in 2020 compared to 2019. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) was 74.1%, a decrease of 7.2 percentage points compared to 2019. The decrease in the loss ratio reflected declines in claims frequencies, partly offset by increases in claims severities and the impact of lower premiums earned attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. Claims frequencies in 2020 were lower for property damage, bodily injury and personal injury protection coverages (twenty-eight to thirty percent range) and collision coverage (twenty-three to twenty-four percent range) compared to 2019. Average claims severities in 2020 were higher for property damage and collision coverages (eight to ten percent range) and bodily injury coverage (twelve to thirteen percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses included net reductions of $253 million in 2020 for decreases in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ loss events compared to net increases of $42 million in 2019. Losses incurred included $81 million in 2020 from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. There were no losses from significant catastrophe events in 2019. Underwriting expenses in 2020 increased $518 million (10.1%) compared to 2019, reflecting higher employee-related, advertising and technology costs partly offset by lower premium taxes. GEICO’s expense ratio in 2020 (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) was 16.1%, an increase of 1.6 percentage points compared to 2019. The expense ratio increase was primarily attributable to the decline in earned premiums from the GEICO Giveback program. 2019 versus 2018 Premiums written and earned in 2019 increased 5.5% and 6.6%, respectively, compared to 2018. These increases were primarily attributable to voluntary auto policies-in-force growth of 6.4%, partially offset by a decrease in average premiums per auto policy. The increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force primarily resulted from an increase in new business sales and a decrease in policies cancelled or not renewed. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 1,068,000 during 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2019 increased 10.1% compared to 2018. The loss ratio in 2019 was 81.3%, an increase of 2.5 percentage points over 2018, primarily due to increases in average claims severities. Average claims severities in 2019 were higher versus 2018 for property damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range) and bodily injury coverage (seven to nine percent range). Claims frequencies in 2019 declined compared to 2018 for property damage and collision coverages (two to four percent range) and personal injury protection coverage (one to two percent range) and were relatively unchanged for bodily injury coverage. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included net increases of $42 million in 2019 and net of decreases $222 million in 2018 for changes in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ loss events. Underwriting expenses in 2019 increased $493 million (10.6%) over 2018. GEICO’s underwriting expense ratio in 2019 was 14.5%, an increase of 0.6 percentage points compared to 2018. The underwriting expense increase was primarily attributable to increases in advertising expenses and employee-related costs, which reflected wage and staffing increases. K-36 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers are Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”) and National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company, Central States Indemnity Company and MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”), acquired October 1, 2018. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 10,212 $ 9,843 $ 8,561 Premiums earned $ 9,615 100.0 $ 9,165 100.0 $ 8,111 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 7,129 74.1 6,336 69.1 5,261 64.9 Underwriting expenses 2,376 24.7 2,446 26.7 2,180 26.9 Total losses and expenses 9,505 98.8 8,782 95.8 7,441 91.8 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 110 $ 383 $ 670 Premiums written increased $369 million (3.7%) in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting increased premiums written from BH Specialty (34%) and MedPro Group (9%), partially offset by a 13% decrease in premiums written by our other primary insurers. The increase at BH Specialty was driven by increased casualty business globally and the increase at MedPro Group reflected increases across several product categories. The decline in volume by our other primary insurers was primarily due to lower workers’ compensation and commercial automobile volumes and the effect of the divestiture of Applied Underwriters in October 2019. The declines in workers’ compensation and commercial auto business written reflected the effects of reduced exposures and premium refunds related to the COVID-19 pandemic and volume reductions attributable to increased price competition in the market. Premiums written increased $1.3 billion (15.0%) in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was attributable to higher volumes from BH Specialty, MedPro Group and GUARD, as well as from the effects of the MLMIC acquisition. These increases were partly offset by lower volume at BHHC and the effect of the Applied Underwriters divestiture. BH Primary’s combined loss ratios were 74.1% in 2020, 69.1% in 2019 and 64.9% in 2018, which reflected the effects of significant catastrophe events during the year and changes in estimated losses for prior years’ loss events. Losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to significant catastrophe events were $207 million in 2020 (Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires) and $190 million in 2018 (Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California). We incurred no losses from significant catastrophe events in 2019. Losses in 2020 also included $167 million attributable to the pandemic. Finally, losses and loss adjustment expenses were reduced $265 million in 2020, $499 million in 2019 and $715 million in 2018 for net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”) and General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and General Re Life Corporation (collectively, “General Re”). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN. K-37 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Premiums written Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 Property/casualty $ 13,295 $ 10,428 $ 9,413 $ 12,214 $ 9,911 $ 8,928 $ (799 ) $ 16 $ (207 ) Life/health 5,848 4,963 5,430 5,861 4,869 5,327 (18 ) 159 182 Retroactive reinsurance 38 684 517 38 684 517 (1,248 ) (1,265 ) (778 ) Periodic payment annuity 566 863 1,156 566 863 1,156 (617 ) (549 ) (340 ) Variable annuity 14 14 16 14 14 16 (18 ) 167 34 $ 19,761 $ 16,952 $ 16,532 $ 18,693 $ 16,341 $ 15,944 $ (2,700 ) $ (1,472 ) $ (1,109 ) Property/casualty A summary of property/casualty reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 13,295 $ 10,428 $ 9,413 Premiums earned $ 12,214 100.0 $ 9,911 100.0 $ 8,928 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 9,898 81.0 7,313 73.8 6,929 77.6 Underwriting expenses 3,115 25.5 2,582 26.0 2,206 24.7 Total losses and expenses 13,013 106.5 9,895 99.8 9,135 102.3 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ (799 ) $ 16 $ (207 ) Premiums written in 2020 increased $2.9 billion (27.5%) compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to new business, including a small number of contracts with very large premiums, and increased participations on renewals. Premiums written in 2019 increased $1.0 billion (10.8%) compared to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to new business, net of non-renewals, and increased participations on renewal business, partly offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar. Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by an increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses of $2.6 billion (35.3%). The loss ratio in 2020 was 81.0%, an increase of 7.2 percentage points over 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2020 included estimated losses of $964 million attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and estimated losses from significant catastrophe events of $667 million from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also reflected net increases in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $162 million in 2020 primarily attributable to legacy environmental, asbestos and other latent injury claims. Such amount as a percentage of the related net unpaid claim liabilities as of the beginning of 2020 was 0.5%. BHRG’s loss ratio was 73.8% in 2019 and 77.6% in 2018. Losses in 2019 included approximately $1.0 billion from Typhoons Faxia and Hagibis and various U.S. and non-U.S. wildfires, while losses in 2018 included approximately $1.3 billion from Hurricanes Florence and Michael, Typhoon Jebi and wildfires in California. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included net decreases of $295 million in 2019 and $469 million in 2018 for prior years’ loss events. Such amounts as percentages of the related net unpaid claim liabilities as of the beginning of the applicable year were 1.0% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2018. Underwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. Underwriting expenses in 2020 increased $533 million (20.6%) over 2019, and underwriting expenses in 2019 increased $376 million (17.0%) over 2018. The increases reflected the increases in premium volumes and changes in business mix. K-38 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 5,848 $ 4,963 $ 5,430 Premiums earned $ 5,861 100.0 $ 4,869 100.0 $ 5,327 100.0 Life and health insurance benefits 4,883 83.3 3,800 78.0 4,240 79.6 Underwriting expenses 996 17.0 910 18.7 905 17.0 Total benefits and expenses 5,879 100.3 4,710 96.7 5,145 96.6 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ (18 ) $ 159 $ 182 Life/health premiums written increased $885 million (17.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019. Approximately $480 million of the increase was attributable to a reinsurance contract covering U.S. health insurance risks that incepted in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was not renewed for 2021. The remainder of the increase was primarily from volume growth in the Asian and European life reinsurance markets. Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by increased life benefits from COVID-19-related claims (approximately $275 million) and continuing losses from increased liabilities from changes in underlying assumptions with respect to disability benefit liabilities in Australia, which were mostly offset by lower other life claims and reduced losses from U.S. long-term care business that is in run-off. The ratio of life and health insurance benefits to premiums earned was 83.3% in 2020 and 81.5% in 2019, which is before the effects of the BHLN contract amendment referred to below. Life/health premiums written in 2019 decreased $467 million (8.6%) compared to 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, BHLN amended a yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract with a major reinsurer. BHLN recorded a reduction in earned premiums on this contract in 2019 of $49 million, while premiums earned in 2018 related to this contract were $954 million. In 2019, premiums earned also included $228 million from a new health reinsurance contract and reflected volume growth in life markets, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar. Underwriting earnings in 2019 included a one-time gain of $163 million attributable to the BHLN yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract amendment. Pre-tax underwriting earnings in 2019 also included losses from increased disability benefit liabilities in Australia, attributable to higher claims experience and changes to various underlying assumptions increased U.S. long-term care liabilities due to discount rate reductions and changes in other actuarial assumptions, and an increase in life claims in North America, partially offset by increased earnings from other international life business. Retroactive reinsurance There were no significant retroactive reinsurance contracts written in 2020. Premiums written were $684 million in 2019 and $517 million in 2018, attributable to a limited number of contracts in each year. Pre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Underwriting results included pre-tax foreign currency losses of $139 million in 2020 and $76 million in 2019 and pre-tax gains of $169 million in 2018. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $1.1 billion in 2020, $1.2 billion in 2019 and $947 million in 2018. Overall, we decreased estimated ultimate liabilities $399 million in 2020 for prior years’ contracts compared to an increase of $378 million in 2019. After adjustments to the related unamortized deferred charges from changes in the estimated timing and amount of the future claim payments, such changes produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $230 million in 2020 and pre-tax losses of $125 million in 2019. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $41.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and $42.4 billion at December 31, 2019. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts were $12.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and $13.7 billion at December 31, 2019. Deferred charge assets will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization. K-39 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned in 2020 decreased $297 million (34.4%) compared to 2019, which decreased $293 million (25.3%) from 2018. Periodic payment annuity business is price sensitive. The volumes written can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality and interest rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency losses of $67 million in 2020 and $40 million in 2019 compared to pre-tax gains of $93 million in 2018. Excluding foreign currency gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $550 million in 2020, $509 million in 2019 and $433 million in 2018. These losses primarily derived from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities, as well as from the impact of mortality and interest rate changes. Discounted annuity liabilities were $14.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and $13.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The weighted average discount rate was approximately 4.0%. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax losses of $18 million in 2020 compared to pre-tax earnings of $167 million in 2019 and $34 million in 2018. The results of this business reflect changes in remaining liabilities for underlying guaranteed benefits reinsured, which are affected by changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting results from these contracts can be volatile, reflecting the volatility of securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs 2019 2019 vs 2018 Interest and other investment income $ 1,059 $ 2,075 $ 1,851 (49.0 )% 12.1 % Dividend income 4,890 4,525 3,652 8.1 23.9 Pre-tax net investment income 5,949 6,600 5,503 (9.9 ) 19.9 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 910 1,070 949 Net investment income $ 5,039 $ 5,530 $ 4,554 Effective income tax rate 15.3 % 16.1 % 17.2 % Interest and other investment income declined $1.0 billion (49.0%) in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. Short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and the decline continued throughout 2020, which resulted in significantly lower interest income. We expect such rates, which are historically low, to remain low, negatively affecting our earnings from such investments in 2021. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. K-40 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Dividend income increased $365 million (8.1%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to dividends from the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% cumulative preferred stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) on August 8, 2019, partly offset by lower dividends from common stock investments. Interest and other investment income increased $224 million (12.1%) in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term investments and interest from a term loan with Seritage Growth Properties, partially offset by lower income earned from fixed maturity securities and limited partnership investments. Dividend income increased $873 million (23.9%) in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in dividend income was attributable to an overall increase in investment levels, including the investment in Occidental and increased dividends from common stock investments. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $138 billion at December 31, 2020, $129 billion at December 31, 2019 and $123 billion at December 31, 2018. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $838 million in 2020, $417 million in 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2018, and consequently, the average cost of float for each of those periods was negative. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows (in millions).

Cars/Units Percentage change 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs 2019 2019 vs 2018 Consumer products 5,266 5,342 5,597 (1.4 )% (4.6 )% Industrial products 1,622 1,931 1,991 (16.0 ) (3.0 ) Agricultural products 1,189 1,146 1,208 3.8 (5.1 ) Coal 1,404 1,802 1,902 (22.1 ) (5.3 ) Total cars/units 9,481 10,221 10,698 (7.2 ) (4.5 ) 2020 versus 2019 Railroad operating revenues declined 11.3% in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting a 7.2% decrease in volume and a 4.5% decrease in average revenue per car/unit. The decrease in revenue per car/unit was attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue driven by lower fuel prices and business mix changes. The overall volume decrease was primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted volumes through the first half of the year. Volumes sequentially improved from earlier periods and recovered overall to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. BNSF is an important component of the national and global supply chain and, as an essential business, has continued to operate throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the pandemic caused significant economic disruptions that adversely affected the demand for transportation services. The pandemic continues to evolve, and the full extent to which it may impact BNSF's business, operating results, financial condition, or liquidity will depend on future developments. We believe BNSF's fundamental business remains strong and it has ample liquidity to continue business operations during this volatile period. K-42 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Pre-tax earnings were $6.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of 6.3% from 2019, principally due to the negative impacts of the pandemic on volumes. In addition, pre-tax earnings in 2019 included an operating revenue increase related to the favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing and a retirement plan curtailment gain that is included in other expenses, net in the preceding table. These effects were partially offset by significant improvements in 2020 in service, system velocity and cost performance compared to 2019, along with lower costs related to severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network, which negatively affected expenses and service levels in 2019. Operating revenues from consumer products of $7.3 billion in 2020 declined 7.6% compared to 2019, primarily due to a 6.3% decrease in average revenue per car/unit along with lower volumes. The volume decrease was primarily due to the impact of the pandemic. Lower international and automotive volumes were offset by higher domestic intermodal volumes. Increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and e-commerce activity produced recovery of intermodal volumes in the second half of 2020. Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.0 billion in 2020, a decrease of 17.0% from 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decline in volume and to a lesser extent lower average revenue per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower U.S. industrial production driven by the pandemic, including reduced production and demand in the energy sector, which drove lower sand and petroleum products volume, along with reduced steel demand, which drove lower taconite volume. Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 2.9% to $4.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was due to higher volumes, partially offset by slightly lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to higher grain and meal exports, partially offsetting adverse impacts of the pandemic, primarily for ethanol and sweeteners shipments. Operating revenues from coal decreased 28.5% to $2.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower volumes, as well as lower revenues per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower natural gas prices, lower electricity demand driven by the pandemic, utility coal plant retirements and mild temperatures. Railroad operating expenses declined 15.3% to $12.4 billion in 2020 as compared to 2019. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues declined 2.9 percentage points to 61.6% in 2020 versus 2019. Railroad operating expenses in 2020 reflected lower volume-related costs, productivity improvements, the effects of cost control initiatives and improved weather conditions compared to 2019. Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $728 million (13.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower employee counts associated with lower volume and due to improved workforce productivity. Fuel expenses decreased $1.2 billion (39.2%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved fuel efficiency. Purchased services expense declined $95 million (4.6%) compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume, improved productivity and higher insurance recoveries in 2020 related to network flooding in 2019. Equipment rents, materials and other expense decreased $344 million (17.0%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower volume-related costs, the effects of cost controls and lower personal injury and derailment expenses. 2019 versus 2018 Railroad operating revenues were $22.7 billion in 2019, a decline of 1.1% versus 2018. During 2019, BNSF’s revenues reflected a 3.6% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit and a 4.5% decrease in volume. The increase in average revenue per car/unit was attributable to increased rates per car/unit and a favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing. Pre-tax earnings were approximately $7.3 billion in 2019, an increase of 5.6% over 2018. BNSF experienced severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network, which negatively affected revenues, expenses and service levels. In addition to the impact of an increase in average revenue per car/unit, earnings in 2019 benefited from a reduction in total operating expenses. K-43 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Operating revenues from consumer products were $7.9 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.5% compared to 2018, reflecting volume decreases and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were driven by moderated demand and the availability of truck capacity, as well as lower west coast imports. Operating revenues from industrial products were $6.1 billion in 2019, an increase of 1.7% from 2018. The increase was attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a decrease in volume. Volumes decreased primarily due to overall softness in the industrial sector, lower sand volumes and reduced car loadings, due to the challenging weather conditions in 2019. Increased demand for petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gas, partially offset the other decreases in volumes. Operating revenues from agricultural products decreased 0.3% in 2019 to $4.7 billion compared to 2018. The decrease was due to lower volumes and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were attributable to export competition from non-U.S. sources, the impacts of international trade policies and the challenging weather conditions in 2019. Operating revenues from coal decreased 7.4% in 2019 to $3.7 billion compared to 2018, reflecting lower average revenue per car/unit and lower volumes. Volumes were negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions, as well as from the effects of lower natural gas prices. Railroad operating expenses were $14.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of $535 million compared to 2018. Our ratio of operating expenses to railroad operating revenues in 2019 of 64.5% decreased 1.7 percentage points versus 2018. Operating expenses in 2019 reflected lower volume-related costs, lower fuel prices and the effects of cost control initiatives, partially offset by the costs associated with the adverse weather conditions. Fuel expenses decreased $402 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved fuel efficiency. Purchased services expense decreased $82 million compared to 2018. The decrease was due to lower purchased transportation costs of our logistics services business, lower drayage, lower services expense and higher insurance recoveries. Equipment rents, materials and other expense decreased $82 million compared to 2018, due to lower locomotive and various other costs associated with lower volumes and cost controls. Other expenses, net decreased $221 million compared to 2018. In 2019, other expenses were net of a $120 million curtailment gain from an amendment to the company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans. Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) We currently own 91.1% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility in which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Three of these systems were acquired on November 1, 2020 from Dominion Energy, Inc. (“BHE GT&S acquisition”). See Note 2 to accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects. BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. K-44 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 15,556 $ 15,371 $ 15,573 Real estate operating revenue 5,396 4,473 4,214 Other income (loss) 79 270 200 Total revenue 21,031 20,114 19,987 Costs and expense: Energy cost of sales 4,187 4,586 4,769 Energy operating expense 7,539 6,824 6,969 Real estate operating costs and expense 4,885 4,251 4,000 Interest expense 1,941 1,835 1,777 Total costs and expense 18,552 17,496 17,515 Pre-tax earnings 2,479 2,618 2,472 Income tax expense (benefit)* (1,010 ) (526 ) (452 ) Net earnings after income taxes 3,489 3,144 2,924 Noncontrolling interests 71 18 23 Net earnings attributable to BHE 3,418 3,126 2,901 Noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends 327 286 280 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 3,091 $ 2,840 $ 2,621 Effective income tax rate (40.7 )% (20.1 )% (18.3 )% *Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation.

PacifiCorp after-tax earnings decreased $32 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease reflected higher operating expenses and net interest expense, partially offset by increased production tax credit benefits driven by repowered wind projects placed in-service, higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and higher other income. The increase in operating expenses was largely due to costs associated with wildfires, a settlement agreement and pension benefits. PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $47 million compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher operating revenue from favorable average retail prices and lower generation and purchased power costs, partially offset by lower operating revenue from a 1.4% decline in retail customer volumes. The decline in retail customer volumes was due to the impacts of the pandemic, partly offset by an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts of weather. MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings increased $37 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected increased income tax benefits, primarily from production tax credits, driven by repowered and new wind projects placed in-service, and the effects of ratemaking. These effects were partially offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service, higher net interest expense, lower other income and lower electric and natural gas utility margins. MEC electric utility margin decreased $10 million to $1.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The electric utility margin decrease was attributable to lower operating revenue from unfavorable wholesale prices and price impacts from changes in retail sales mix. These effects were mostly offset by lower generation and purchased power costs and higher operating revenue from a 1.2% increase in retail customer volumes. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to increased usage by certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic. Natural gas utility margin decreased $9 million in 2020 compared to 2019, due to the unfavorable impacts of weather. NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings increased $45 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and lower income tax expense from the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher earnings sharing accruals for customers at Nevada Power Company and higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service. NV Energy electric utility margin increased $100 million to $1.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher operating revenue from a 1.5% increase in electric retail customer volumes, including distribution-only service customers and price impacts from changes in retail sales mix. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to the favorable impacts of weather, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic. Northern Powergrid after-tax earnings decreased $55 million in 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings decrease reflected write-offs of gas exploration costs and higher income tax expense, in large part from a change in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate, partially offset by lower pension costs and interest expense. Natural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $106 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to $73 million of earnings from the BHE GT&S acquisition, the favorable impact of a rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas and higher transportation volume and rates, partially offset by higher depreciation, operating expenses and interest expenses. Other energy business after-tax earnings in 2020 increased $89 million compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation, partially offset by lower operating revenue and higher operating expenses from geothermal and natural gas units. K-46 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $215 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher earnings from mortgage and brokerage services. The increase in earnings from mortgage services was attributable to higher refinance activity from the favorable interest rate environment and the earnings increase from brokerage services was due to an increase of 13.1% in closed transaction dollar volume. Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $113 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was primarily due to higher interest expense and lower state income tax benefits. 2019 versus 2018 PacifiCorp after-tax earnings were $773 million in 2019, an increase of $34 million compared to 2018, reflecting slightly higher utility margin and higher other income, partly offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service. PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $4 million compared to 2018, as a 0.4% increase in retail customer volumes was largely offset by lower wholesale revenue mainly due to lower volumes. MEC after-tax earnings of $781 million in 2019 increased $112 million as compared to 2018, primarily attributable to increases in electric utility margin, income tax benefits from higher production tax credits and the effects of ratemaking and other income. Electric utility margin in 2019 increased 2% to $1.8 billion, primarily due to higher wind generation and higher retail customer volumes of 1.4%, as a 4.0% increase in industrial volumes was largely offset by lower residential volumes from the unfavorable impacts of weather. These earnings increases were partially offset by increased depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service (net of lower Iowa revenue sharing) and higher net interest expense. NV Energy after-tax earnings were $365 million in 2019, an increase of $48 million compared to 2018, as lower operating expenses were partly offset by lower electric utility margin. Electric utility margin in 2019 was $1.6 billion, representing a decrease of $58 million (3%) versus 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.4% decline in retail customer volumes, largely attributable to the impacts of weather, and rate reductions from the impact of the changes in U.S. income tax laws, partially offset by retail customer growth. Northern Powergrid after-tax earnings increased in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting higher distribution revenues and lower operating expenses, which were largely from lower pension settlement losses in 2019, partially offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a strong average U.S. Dollar. Distribution revenues increased $18 million, attributable to higher tariff rates, partly offset by lower distributed units. Natural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $35 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher transportation revenues from generally higher volumes and rates, favorable margins from system balancing activities and a decrease in operating expenses, partly offset by higher depreciation expense from increased spending on capital projects. Other energy businesses after-tax earnings in 2019 increased $119 million compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to improved earnings from renewable wind energy projects ($49 million from tax equity investments and $25 million from new and existing projects and activities), higher income from geothermal and natural gas units, largely due to higher generation and favorable margins and lower operating expenses, partly offset by lower earnings at a hydroelectric facility in the Philippines due to lower rainfall. The increase in earnings also reflected the effects of favorable regulatory decisions received in 2019 and the unfavorable impacts of a regulatory rate order received in 2018 at AltaLink L.P. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings at mortgage businesses due to increased refinance activity and earnings attributable to recent business acquisitions, partially offset by lower earnings at brokerage businesses, primarily from a decrease in closed units and lower margins. Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $155 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The earnings decline was primarily due to income tax benefits recognized in 2018 related to the reduction of accrued repatriation taxes on undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the changes in U.S. income tax laws, higher interest expense and lower earnings from non-regulated energy services. K-47 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions).

In 2020, such expenses also exclude after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $10.4 billion. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page K-33 and in the “Other” earnings section on page K-56. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs 2019 2019 vs 2018 Revenues Industrial products $ 25,667 $ 30,594 $ 30,679 (16.1 )% (0.3 )% Building products 21,244 20,327 18,677 4.5 8.8 Consumer products 12,168 11,809 12,527 3.0 (5.7 ) $ 59,079 $ 62,730 $ 61,883 Pretax earnings Industrial products $ 3,755 $ 5,635 $ 5,822 (33.4 )% (3.2 )% Building products 2,858 2,636 2,336 8.4 12.8 Consumer products 1,397 1,251 1,208 11.7 3.6 $ 8,010 $ 9,522 $ 9,366 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Industrial products 14.6 % 18.4 % 19.0 % Building products 13.5 % 13.0 % 12.5 % Consumer products 11.5 % 10.6 % 9.6 % K-48 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products The industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International (“CTB”)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products (“LSPI”)). Marmon consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, including equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. 2020 versus 2019 Revenues of the industrial products group in 2020 declined $4.9 billion (16.1%) from 2019, while pre-tax earnings declined $1.9 billion (33.4%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 14.6% in 2020 compared to 18.4% in 2019. PCC’s revenues were $7.3 billion in 2020, a decrease of $3.0 billion (28.9%) compared to 2019. Historically, a significant portion of PCC’s earnings have been dependent on sales related to the aerospace industry. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and aircraft production. Airlines responded to the pandemic by delaying delivery of aircraft orders or, in some cases, cancelling aircraft orders, resulting in significant reductions in build rates by aircraft manufacturers and significant inventory reduction initiatives by PCC’s customers. Further, Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft production issues contributed to the declines in aerospace product sales across the industry in 2020. These factors resulted in significant declines in demand for PCC’s aerospace products in 2020. In 2020, PCC’s sales of products for power markets increased 2.2%, primarily driven by increases in industrial gas turbine products, offset by reductions in oil and gas products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 were $650 million, a decrease of 64.5% compared to 2019, which reflected the decline in aerospace product sales as well as increased manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to lower volumes. In response to the effects of the pandemic, PCC has taken aggressive restructuring actions to resize operations in response to reduced expected volumes in aerospace markets. PCC’s worldwide workforce was reduced by about 40% since the end of 2019. PCC recorded charges for restructuring and inventory and fixed asset charges of approximately $295 million in 2020. Although earnings as a percentage of revenues were negatively impacted in 2020 due to inefficiencies associated with aligning operations to reduced aircraft build rates, the restructuring actions taken contributed to improved margins in the fourth quarter compared to earlier in the year and further margin improvements are expected in the future. The level of aircraft production is currently expected to slowly increase beginning in the latter half of 2021. However, this is dependent of the timing and extent that COVID-19 infections are lowered on a sustained basis and the return to historical levels of air travel and subsequent demand for aerospace products. Lubrizol’s revenues were $5.95 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.0% compared to 2019. The decline was primarily attributable to lower volumes from economic effects of the pandemic and a fire at an Additives manufacturing, blending and storage facility in Rouen, France at the end of the third quarter of 2019, which resulted in the temporary suspension of operations. Revenues in 2020 also reflected lower selling prices, partly offset by favorable changes in sales mix. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume for the year declined 9% in 2020 compared to 2019, due to declines in the Additives and Engineered Materials product lines, partly offset by higher volumes in Life Science products. Overall, the effects of the pandemic on Lubrizol were more pronounced in the first half of the year, as volumes rebounded significantly in the second half. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 were approximately $1.0 billion, essentially unchanged compared to 2019. The effects of lower sales volumes, including the effects from the Rouen fire and lower average selling prices were offset by lower average raw material costs, lower operating expenses and insurance recoveries in 2020 associated with the Rouen fire. Marmon’s revenues were $7.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of $681 million (8.2%) compared to 2019. Excluding the effects of business acquisitions, revenues decreased in essentially all sectors, primarily attributable to lower demand from the effects of the pandemic. The largest effects were experienced in the Transportation Products and Foodservice Technologies sectors. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower metal prices in the Metal Services sector and the effect of business divestitures in 2019. Declines in oil prices in 2020 also adversely affected demand and revenues in the Rail & Leasing and Crane Services sectors. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 decreased $312 million (24.3%) as compared to 2019. The decrease reflected the declines in revenues, increased restructuring charges and lower interest income. Restructuring initiatives were initiated in response to the lower product demand, particularly in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic. K-49 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) IMC’s revenues declined 13.2% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting negative economic effects from the pandemic on demand for cutting tools in most geographic regions, partly offset by the effects of business acquisitions over the past year. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 26.6% in 2020 versus 2019, attributable to declines in sales and margins due to lower volumes and to changes in sales mix. 2019 versus 2018 Revenues of the industrial products group were slightly lower in 2019 than in 2018 and pre-tax earnings declined 3.2% compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 18.4% in 2019 compared to 19.0% in 2018. PCC’s revenues were $10.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $74 million (0.7%) compared to 2018. In 2019, PCC generated increased sales in aerospace markets, which was partially offset by lower sales in the power markets. The increase in aerospace sales was tempered due to significant efforts focused on the ramp-up requirements for certain new aerospace programs, such as LEAP, that created manufacturing inefficiencies and slowed production cycles contributing to delays in product deliveries and sales. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 5.1% in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting increased sales of aerospace products and higher earnings from various non-recurring items in 2019, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the power markets due to the decrease in sales. Temporary unplanned shutdowns of certain metals facilities and metal press outages also negatively impacted earnings in 2018. PCC incurred incremental costs in 2019 to meet required deliveries to customers associated with the increased aerospace demand, which negatively affected margins and earnings. The production headwinds experienced were primarily attributable to shortages of qualified skilled labor and the rapid increase in requirements for newer, complex aerospace products. Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2019, a decrease of 5.2% compared to 2018. The decline reflected lower volumes, including the effects from the Rouen fire, and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by higher average selling prices which were necessitated by raw material cost increases. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume in 2019 declined 4% from 2018, primarily due to volume decline of 6% in the Additives product lines. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2019 for the fourth quarter and year decreased 50.5% and 14.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018. Earnings in 2019 were significantly impacted by costs and lost business associated with the Rouen fire. Lubrizol’s operating results in 2019 were also negatively affected by lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by improved material margins. Marmon’s revenues were $8.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $146 million (1.8%) compared to 2018. The revenue increase reflected the effects of business acquisitions, higher volumes in several business sectors, which were largely offset by lower distribution volumes in the Metals Services sector, unfavorable foreign currency translation and the impact of lower metal prices in the Electrical and Plumbing & Refrigeration sectors. Marmon’s business acquisitions included the acquisition of the Colson Medical companies on October 31, 2019, resulting in a new Medical sector. Marmon’s Rail & Leasing and Crane Services sectors benefitted from higher railcar equipment sales, railcar fleet utilization, railcar repair services, intermodal container leasing revenue and improved crane rental demand in the U.S. and Australia. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased $12 million in 2019 (1.0%) as compared to 2018. The earnings increase reflected the effects of business acquisitions, partly offset by lower gains from business divestitures. Earnings in 2019 also reflected increased earnings in sectors that experienced sales volume increases, which were substantially offset by lower earnings in the Metal Services and certain other sectors, the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency translation and increased interest and other expenses. IMC’s revenues declined 1.3% in 2019 as compared to 2018, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower sales in several regions, including Asia and Europe, mostly offset by increased revenues from recent business acquisitions. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 12.8% in 2019 versus 2018, attributable to unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, changes in business mix to lower margin items and the effects of the U.S./China trade disputes. K-50 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore), and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). 2020 versus 2019 Revenues of the building products group increased $917 million (4.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings increased $222 million (8.4%) over 2019. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.5% in 2020 and 13.0% in 2019. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $8.6 billion in 2020, an increase of $1.3 billion (17.1%) over 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases in home sales of $1.0 billion (18.4%), driven by increases in units sold and revenue per home sold and by changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 28.6% in 2020 over 2019, while revenue per home increased slightly. Manufactured home unit sales increased 2.8% in 2020. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage services, insurance and interest income from lending activities increased 13.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, attributable to increased loan originations and average outstanding loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $17.1 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $15.9 billion as of December 31, 2019. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.25 billion in 2020, an increase of $152 million (13.9%) compared to 2019. The earnings increase reflected higher earnings from home sales, partly offset by higher materials costs, which lowered manufactured housing gross margin rates. Earnings in 2020 also benefitted from increased interest income, lower interest expense and higher earnings from mortgage services, partly offset by increased provisions for credit and insurance losses. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $12.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of 2.6% versus 2019. The revenue decrease reflected lower flooring volumes, partly attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by increased paint and coatings volumes, including volumes from a new agreement with Ace Hardware Stores, and increased volumes in residential markets. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 4.6% over 2019. The earnings increase reflected the effects of lower average input costs, operating cost containment efforts and lower facilities closure costs. 2019 versus 2018 Revenues of the building products group in 2019 increased $1.65 billion (8.8%) compared to 2018, while pre-tax earnings increased 12.8% over 2018. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.0% in 2019 and 12.5% in 2018. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $7.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.3 billion (21.5%) over 2018. The comparative increase was primarily due to a 26% increase in home sales, reflecting a net increase in units sold and changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 84% in 2019 over 2018, primarily due to business acquisitions, while average prices declined 5%. Manufactured home unit retail sales increased 5% and wholesale sales were 9% lower in 2019. Interest income from lending activities increased 6.7% in 2019 compared to 2018, attributable to increased originations and average outstanding loan balances. Aggregate loan balances outstanding were approximately $15.9 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $14.7 billion as of December 31, 2018. Clayton Homes’ pre-tax earnings were $1.1 billion in 2019, an increase of $182 million (20.0%) compared to 2018. The increase was attributable to home building activities, which benefitted from the increases in home sales, and to financial services activities. Pre-tax earnings from lending and finance activities increased 12%, primarily due to an increase in interest income attributable to higher average loan balances, increased earnings from other financial services and lower credit losses, partially offset by higher interest expense, attributable to higher average borrowings and interest rates, and by higher other operating costs. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were $13.0 billion in 2019, an increase of 2.8% versus 2018. Revenues increased for paint and coatings, hard surface flooring and roofing products, attributable to a combination of increased volumes, product mix changes and increased average selling prices, while sales of brick products declined. K-51 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were $1.5 billion in 2019, an increase of 8.2% over 2018. Earnings in 2019 benefitted from a combination of increases in selling prices in certain product categories, declining raw material costs for certain commodities and operating cost control initiatives, which were partly offset by the effects of increased facilities closure costs. Consumer products The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). 2020 versus 2019 Consumer products revenues increased of $359 million (3.0%) in 2020 versus 2019, while pre-tax earnings increased $146 million (11.7%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2020 increased 0.9 percentage points to 11.5%. The comparative increase in revenues reflected revenue increases from Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower apparel and footwear revenues. Forest River revenues increased 11.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily attributable to a significant increase in recreational vehicle unit sales over the last half of the year and changes in sales mix. Unit sales in the second half of 2020 increased 31% over the second half of 2019. Revenues from Duracell increased 10.0% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting the effects of changes in sales mix and increased volume. Apparel and footwear revenues declined 6.1% in 2020 compared to 2019. Apparel and footwear sales volumes in the first half of 2020, particularly in the second quarter, reflected the negative effects of the pandemic, which included retail store closures, reduced or cancelled orders and pandemic-related disruptions at certain manufacturing facilities. Sales recovered somewhat in the second half of 2020, attributable to higher consumer demand and inventory restocking by retailers. Brooks Sports revenues were higher, partly attributable to the effect of the reduced sales in 2019 that were caused by shipping delays at a new distribution facility. The comparative increase in pre-tax earnings was primarily attributable to Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower earnings from apparel and footwear. The increase reflected the effects of sales volumes changes and ongoing expense management efforts. 2019 versus 2018 Consumer products revenues declined $718 million (5.7%) in 2019 versus 2018, driven by a 12.9% revenue decline from Forest River, primarily due to lower unit sales. Revenues of Duracell increased 1.3% and apparel and footwear revenues declined 1.1% compared to 2018. Although revenues from Brooks Sports increased 3.5% in 2019, its operating results were negatively affected by lost sales associated with problems encountered at a distribution center that opened in the second quarter. In addition, our other apparel and other footwear businesses continue to experience lower sales volumes for certain products, reflecting the shift by major retailers towards private label products. Consumer products pre-tax earnings increased $43 million (3.6%) in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to continuing cost containment efforts across several of the businesses and the effects of a new Duracell product launch, partially offset by the impact of lower recreational vehicle sales at Forest River. K-52 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs 2019 2019 vs 2018 Revenues Service $ 12,346 $ 13,496 $ 13,333 (8.5 )% 1.2 % Retailing 15,832 15,991 15,606 (1.0 ) 2.5 McLane Company 46,840 50,458 49,987 (7.2 ) 0.9 $ 75,018 $ 79,945 $ 78,926 Pre-tax earnings Service $ 1,600 $ 1,681 $ 1,836 (4.8 )% (8.4 )% Retailing 1,028 874 860 17.6 1.6 McLane Company 251 288 246 (12.8 ) 17.1 $ 2,879 $ 2,843 $ 2,942 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Service 13.0 % 12.5 % 13.8 % Retailing 6.5 % 5.5 % 5.5 % McLane Company 0.5 % 0.6 % 0.5 % Service Our service business group offers shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI), franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen) and offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and the operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). 2020 versus 2019 Service group revenues declined $1.15 billion (8.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings decreased $81 million (4.8%). Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 13.0% in 2020 compared to 12.5% in 2019. The aggregate revenues of NetJets and FlightSafety in 2020 declined $816 million (13.5%) compared to 2019, reflecting lower demand for air travel and aviation services attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. NetJets experienced a decline in flight hours of 27% and FlightSafety’s commercial and corporate simulator training hours declined 30% from 2019. The comparative service group revenue decline was also attributable to the effects of the disposition of the newspaper operations in March of 2020 and lower revenues from CORT, which was driven by lower demand attributable to the effects of the pandemic. Partially offsetting these declines were revenue increases at TTI and at WPLG. The decline in earnings reflected lower earnings from NetJets, TTI and CORT and from the effects of the divestiture of the newspaper operations, partly offset by higher earnings from XTRA, Business Wire, WPLG and FlightSafety. TTI’s earnings decline reflected lower average gross margin rates, attributable to product mix changes and sales price pressures deriving from ample inventory availability. The decline at NetJets was primarily attributable to increased asset impairment charges and restructuring costs, partly offset by lower general and administrative expenses and a slight net increase in margins. The decline at CORT was driven by lower revenues, partly offset by the effects of cost control initiatives. The increase at FlightSafety was attributable to the effects of contract losses recorded in 2019 with respect to an existing government contract and cost control efforts in 2020, which more than offset significantly lower earnings from commercial and corporate training services. K-53 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service (Continued) 2019 versus 2018 Service group revenues increased $163 million (1.2%) in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily attributable to increased sales at TTI and higher aviation-related services revenues (NetJets and FlightSafety), partially offset by decreases from the media businesses and Charter Brokerage. TTI’s sales increased 2% in 2019 compared to the exceptionally high sales levels in 2018. TTI’s sales slowed throughout 2019, attributable to softening customer demand, lower average selling prices and the effects of U.S. trade tariffs. The increase in NetJets’ revenues in 2019 reflected increased lease revenue, primarily attributable to an increase in aircraft on lease, and increased flight hours, partly offset by lower revenue from prepaid flight cards. The revenue decline at Charter Brokerage was attributable to the divesture of a high revenue, low margin business in mid-2019. Pre-tax earnings of the service group decreased $155 million (8.4%) compared to 2018. The comparative earnings decline was primarily due to lower earnings from TTI and FlightSafety, partly offset by higher earnings from NetJets. TTI’s earnings decline was primarily attributable to lower gross margins, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and higher operating expenses. The earnings decline at FlightSafety was attributable to pre-tax losses of approximately $165 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 in connection with an existing government contract, partly offset by lower training equipment impairment charges. Earnings from NetJets increased in 2019, primarily attributable to increased revenues and improved fleet and operating efficiencies, which improved operating margins. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”), which consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products and represented 62.6% of our combined retailing revenue in 2020. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics and represented 20.6% of the combined retailing revenues in 2020. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. 2020 versus 2019 Retailing group revenues in 2020 declined $159 million (1.0%) compared to 2019. The spread of COVID-19 throughout the U.S. resulted in the temporary closures or restricted operations at several of our retailing businesses and effected consumer spending patterns during 2020. The severity and duration of the effects from the pandemic varied widely at our retail operations. BHA’s revenues decreased 2.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. BHA’s revenues in 2020 reflected decreases in new and pre-owned vehicle sales of 2.6% as well as lower vehicle service and repair revenues. Home furnishings revenues were essentially unchanged in 2020 compared to 2019. The group experienced lower revenues in the first half of 2020, attributable to restricted store hours, which were substantially offset by increased revenues over the second half of the year. However, supply chain disruptions had a negative effect on obtaining product at certain times, which negatively affected sales levels. The effects of the pandemic contributed to significantly lower sales in 2020 for our jewelry stores, See’s Candy and Oriental Trading Company, which were more than offset by significant revenue increases from Pampered Chef and Louis. Sales volumes generally increased and operating results improved beginning in the latter part of the second quarter as our operations slowly reopened. K-54 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) Retail group pre-tax earnings increased $154 million (17.6%) in 2020 from 2019. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 37.7%, primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses, lower floorplan interest expense and higher average gross sales margin rates. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased 1.1% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting higher earnings from the home furnishings businesses and from Pampered Chef, which were substantially offset by lower earnings from our other retailing operations. Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased $79 million (36%) in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting generally higher average gross margin rates, sales mix changes and fewer sales promotions, and from lower advertising and other operating expenses. Certain of our other operations, including Pampered Chef and Louis experienced significant earnings increases in 2020, while others, including See’s Candy and Oriental Trading Company, experienced significant declines driven by the negative effects of the pandemic. 2019 versus 2018 Retailing group revenues increased $385 million (2.5%) in 2019 compared to 2018. BHA’s revenues increased 4.1% in 2019 over 2018, primarily attributable to an 11.5% increase in pre-owned vehicle sales, vehicle pricing increases, improvement in vehicle finance and service contract activities and vehicle repair work as compared to 2018. New vehicle sales in 2019 were relatively unchanged from 2018. Home furnishings group revenues declined 1.3% in 2019 compared to 2018, as sales were relatively unchanged or lower in each of our home furnishings operations. Retail group pre-tax earnings increased $14 million (1.6%) in 2019 over 2018. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 22.7%, primarily due to the increases in earnings from finance and service contract activities, partly offset by higher floorplan interest expense. Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings declined 14.7% versus 2018, reflecting the decline in revenues and generally higher operating expenses. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised about two-thirds of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2020 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. 2020 versus 2019 Revenues declined $3.6 billion (7.2%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was attributable to COVID-19 related restaurant closures (particularly in the casual dining category) in the foodservice business and lower sales in certain product categories within the grocery business. McLane operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year and 2020 included 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in 2019. Otherwise, revenues declined 5.2% in the grocery business and 7.7% in the foodservice business in 2020 as compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings decreased $37 million (12.8%) in 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings decrease included the effects of increased LIFO inventory reserves of $22 million, credit and inventory losses of $12 million in the foodservice operations and the impact of lower sales. McLane continues to operate in an intensely competitive business environment, which is negatively affecting its current operating results. We expect that these operating conditions will continue. 2019 versus 2018 Revenues increased $471 million (0.9%) in 2019 compared to 2018. McLane’s results in 2019 included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2018. Otherwise, revenues decreased roughly 3% in the grocery business and increased 3% in the foodservice business in 2019 as compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings increased $42 million (17.1%) as compared to 2018. The earnings increase in 2019 reflected an increase in average gross margin rates and changes in business mix, partly offset by increased operating expenses, the largest portion of which was employee costs. K-55 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains (Losses) A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses follows (dollars in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Investment gains (losses) $ 40,905 $ 71,123 $ (22,155 ) Derivative gains (losses) (159 ) 1,484 (300 ) Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 40,746 72,607 (22,455 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 9,155 15,162 (4,718 ) Net gains (losses) $ 31,591 $ 57,445 $ (17,737 ) Effective income tax rate 21.7 % 20.9 % 20.8 % Investment gains (losses) We are required to include the unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities in earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains included net unrealized gains of approximately $55.0 billion in 2020 attributable to changes in market prices of equity securities we held at December 31, 2020 and net losses of approximately $14.0 billion from changes in market prices during 2020 on securities sold during 2020. We recorded pre-tax unrealized investment gains of approximately $69.6 billion in 2019 attributable to changes in market prices in 2019 on equity securities we held at December 31, 2019. Pre-tax unrealized investment losses of approximately $22.7 billion were recorded in 2018 attributable to market price changes in 2018 on equity securities we held at December 31, 2018. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold, which is the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $6.2 billion in 2020, $3.2 billion in 2019 and $3.3 billion in 2018. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings, including the changes in market prices for equity securities, in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative gains (losses) Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. Substantially all remaining contracts will expire by February 2023. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant, primarily due to the volatility of underlying equity markets. As of December 31, 2020, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was $727 million and our recorded liability at fair value was approximately $1.1 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. Equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax losses of $159 million in 2020, pre-tax gains of $1.5 billion in 2019 and pre-tax losses of $300 million in 2018. These gains and losses reflected changes in the equity index values and shorter remaining contract durations. Settlement payments to counterparties were relatively insignificant in each of the three years. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Equity method earnings (losses) $ 665 $ 1,023 $ (1,419 ) Acquisition accounting expenses (783 ) (788 ) (831 ) Goodwill and intangible asset impairments (10,381 ) (96 ) (280 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (334 ) (280 ) (311 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes (764 ) 58 289 Income tax expense adjustments (60 ) (377 ) — Other, principally corporate investment income 339 884 986 $ (11,318 ) $ 424 $ (1,566 ) K-56 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other (Continued) After-tax equity method earnings (losses) include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. Our after-tax earnings from Kraft Heinz were $170 million in 2020 and $488 million in 2019 and our after-tax losses were $1,859 million in 2018. Our earnings from Kraft Heinz included our after-tax share of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz in each year. Our after-tax share of such charges was $611 million in 2020, $339 million in 2019 and approximately $2.7 billion in 2018. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2020 included after-tax charges of $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets that were recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. See Critical Accounting Policies on page K-63 for additional details. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s outstanding Euro denominated debt (€6.85 billion par) and Japanese Yen denominated debt (¥625.5 billion par), and BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt (£1.75 billion par). Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produced gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The income tax expense adjustments relate to investments that were made between 2015 and 2018 in certain tax equity investment funds. Our investments in these funds aggregated approximately $340 million. In December 2018, we first learned of allegations by federal authorities of fraudulent conduct by the sponsor of these funds. In January 2020, the principals involved in creating the investment funds plead guilty to criminal charges related to the sale of the investments. In the first quarter of 2019, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the previously recognized income tax benefits were not valid. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 was $443.2 billion, an increase of $18.4 billion since December 31, 2019, which was net of common stock repurchases of $24.7 billion. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $42.5 billion and included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $31.7 billion. During each of the last three years, changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities produced exceptional volatility in our earnings. Our results in 2020 also included after-tax goodwill and other intangible asset impairments charges of $11.0 billion. At December 31, 2020, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $135.0 billion, which included $112.8 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $301.6 billion. Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 was $22.7 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion since December 31, 2019. In 2020, Berkshire repaid maturing senior notes of €1.0 billion and issued €1.0 billion of 0.0% senior notes due in 2025. Berkshire also issued ¥195.5 billion of senior notes (approximately $1.8 billion) with a weighted average interest rate of 1.07% and maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2060. In the first quarter of 2021, senior notes of $1.7 billion will mature, including $665 million (€550 million) that matured in January. In January 2021, Berkshire issued €600 million of 0.5% senior notes due in 2041. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were approximately $18.9 billion at December 31, 2020, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $13.1 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In 2020, BHFC repaid $900 million of maturing senior notes and issued $3.0 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2030 to 2050 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.3%. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes. In January 2021, $750 million of BHFC debt matured and BHFC issued $750 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2051. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of these two operations were $9.8 billion in 2020 and we forecast a similar amount of capital expenditures in 2021. K-57 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. In 2020, BNSF issued $575 million of 3.05% senior unsecured debentures due in 2051. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $52.2 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $9.6 billion since December 31, 2019. In 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries issued new term debt of approximately $7.6 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2062 and repaid approximately $3.2 billion of debt. BHE also assumed $5.6 billion in debt in connection with the business acquired from Dominion Energy in November 2020. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program as amended permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In 2020, Berkshire paid $24.7 billion to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the financial statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. The timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 follows (in millions). Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table.

(3) Amounts represent estimated undiscounted benefits, net of estimated future premiums, as applicable. K-58 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2020 follows. Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities and all techniques require significant judgments and assumptions. As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include liabilities for reported claims and for claims not yet reported. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails. Our consolidated claim liabilities as of December 31, 2020 were approximately $120.8 billion (including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance), of which 83% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid losses of these businesses follows. GEICO GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December 31, 2020, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses were $22.9 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $21.8 billion. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies. Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2020, case development liabilities averaged approximately 33% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities. Incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2019 were reduced by $253 million during 2020, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2020 reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated. K-59 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average severities will change by at least one percentage point from the severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2020. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $300 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through NICO and General Re. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2020 follows (in millions). Property Casualty Total Reported case liabilities $ 5,714 $ 9,497 $ 15,211 IBNR liabilities 5,821 14,615 20,436 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 11,535 24,112 35,647 Reinsurance recoverable 181 864 1,045 Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 11,354 $ 23,248 $ 34,602 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess contracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information is often less detailed with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts and is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR estimates to reinsurers. Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. In the U.S., such reporting is generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. Reinsurers may assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, which may further delay the reporting of claims. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage, and for other reasons. As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain certain internal procedures in order to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. K-60 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. We generally rely on the ceding companies reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2020, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $800 million for certain legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates. Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, BHRG uses a variety of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data and other benchmarks, as appropriate. The estimate of the required IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories: Paid and incurred loss development methods – these methods consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns. Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods – these methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses. Frequency and severity methods – these methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses. Additional Analysis – in some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis, determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgement on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events. Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications. In 2020, certain workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $160 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1 billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. K-61 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) For other casualty losses, excluding asbestos, environmental, and other latent injury claims, the overall change in estimates for prior years’ events was not significant in 2020. However, the potential for significant changes in future periods remains. For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business. Estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts increased $468 million in 2020, which produced a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings. Net liabilities for such claims were approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2020. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. Retroactive reinsurance Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities relating to our retroactive reinsurance contracts are predominately related to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-tails to be very long. As of December 31, 2020, gross unpaid losses were $41.0 billion and deferred charge assets were $12.4 billion. Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $56 billion. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our estimated gross liability. We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expected results are revealed. Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.5 billion at December 31, 2020. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities. We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $399 million in 2020, which after the changes in related deferred charge assets, resulted in pre-tax earnings of $230 million. In 2020, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $1.1 billion with respect to these contracts. K-62 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance (Continued) In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortize deferred charge assets, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances and the amount of periodic amortization. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2020, we currently estimate that amortization expense in 2021 will approximate $1.1 billion. Other Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.7 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.3 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more-likely-not there has been an impairment. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and intangible assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss. In response to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we considered whether goodwill needed to be reevaluated for impairment during the second quarter of 2020. We determined it was necessary to quantitively reevaluate goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, and most significantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10.0 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC. Prior to the reevaluation, the carrying value of goodwill related to PCC was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, the carrying value of PCC’s indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of these amounts were recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of PCC in 2016. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers is particularly severe. We considered a number of factors in our reevaluation, including but not limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand, employment levels and aircraft orders, announcements by manufacturers on reduced aircraft production, and the actions we are taking or may take to restructure our operations to fit lower expected demand. In our judgment, the timing and extent of the recovery in the commercial airline and aerospace industries may be dependent on the development and wide-scale distribution of medicines and vaccines that effectively treat the virus. Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing for impairments. As of December 31, 2020, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units at this time is and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on the reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could prove to be worse than we currently estimate and could lead us to record additional goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in 2021. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. K-63 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Equity Price Risk Equity securities represent a significant portion of our investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Historically, equity investments have been concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2020, approximately 68% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in four issuers. We often hold our equity investments for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. Our ultimate liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date. The fair values of our liabilities arising from these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates and the remaining duration of the contracts. The following table summarizes our equity securities and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions. Fair Value Hypothetical Price Change Estimated Fair Value after Hypothetical Change in Prices Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Net Earnings (1) December 31, 2020 Investments in equity securities $ 281,170 30% increase $ 362,830 $ 63,321 30% decrease 199,547 (63,293 ) Equity index put option contract liabilities 1,065 30% increase 257 638 30% decrease 2,702 (1,293 ) December 31, 2019 Investments in equity securities $ 248,027 30% increase $ 319,445 $ 56,493 30% decrease 176,749 (56,382 ) Equity index put option contract liabilities 968 30% increase 267 554 30% decrease 2,776 (1,428 ) (1) The estimated increase (decrease) is after income taxes at the statutory rate in effect as of the balance sheet date. K-64 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Market Risk Disclosures (Continued) Interest Rate Risk We may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit ratings, in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in the reported liabilities. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2020 and 2019. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and do not use derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risks in a meaningful way. Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and service subsidiaries. A portion of our financial statement translation-related impact from changes in foreign currency rates is recorded in other comprehensive income. In addition, we include gains or losses in net earnings related to certain liabilities of Berkshire and U.S. insurance subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies, due to changes in exchange rates. A summary of these gains (losses), after-tax, for each of the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows (in millions). 2020 2019 Non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings $ (764 ) $ 58 Net liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts included in net earnings (163 ) (92 ) Foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income 1,264 257 Commodity Price Risk Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risks to any significant degree. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page K-67.

1067983,BRK-B,BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC,2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Insurance – underwriting $ 728 $ 657 $ 325 Insurance – investment income 4,807 5,039 5,530 Railroad 5,990 5,161 5,481 Utilities and energy 3,495 3,091 2,840 Manufacturing, service and retailing 11,120 8,300 9,372 Investment and derivative gains/losses 62,340 31,591 57,445 Other* 1,315 (11,318 ) 424 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 89,795 $ 42,521 $ 81,417 * Includes goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $259 million in 2021, $11.0 billion in 2020 and $435 million in 2019, which includes our share of charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected most of our businesses beginning in March of 2020, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe. Earnings of most of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter of 2020. Over the second half of 2020 and continuing in 2021, many of these businesses experienced significant recoveries in revenues and earnings, in some instances exceeding pre-pandemic levels. However, many of our businesses were negatively affected by ongoing global supply chain disruptions, including those attributable to major winter storms and a hurricane in North America, which contributed to higher input costs. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities at our operations will completely normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $728 million in 2021, $657 million in 2020 and $325 million in 2019. In each year, we generated underwriting earnings from primary insurance and underwriting losses from reinsurance. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $2.3 billion in 2021, $750 million in 2020 and $800 million in 2019. Underwriting results in 2021 were favorably impacted by reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years under property and casualty contracts. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively impacted by reductions in earned premium from the GEICO Giveback program, higher private passenger auto claims frequencies and severities estimates and higher losses in the life reinsurance business. Underwriting results in 2020 included the effects of the pandemic, arising from premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program, reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile insurance and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance and property and casualty reinsurance business. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2021 decreased 4.6% compared to 2020 and declined 8.9% in 2020 versus 2019. Earnings in 2021 and 2020 were negatively affected by declines in interest rates on our substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. K-32 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Results of Operations (Continued) After-tax earnings of our railroad business in 2021 rose 16.1% compared to 2020 and decreased 5.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. The earnings increase in 2021 reflected overall higher freight volumes, higher average revenue per car/unit and improved productivity, partly offset by higher average fuel prices and volume related costs. Earnings in 2020 reflected lower railroad operating revenues from lower shipping volumes, attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business in 2021 increased 13.1% versus 2020 and increased 8.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in 2021 included higher earnings from the utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses, including the effects of a business acquisition, and from the real estate brokerage business, while the earnings increase in 2020 reflected increased tax benefits from renewable energy and increased earnings from the real estate brokerage business. Earnings in 2021 from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 34.0% versus 2020 and declined 11.4% in 2020 versus 2019. Many of our businesses generated significantly higher earnings in 2021 compared to 2020. While customer demand for products was relatively high during the year, several of our businesses experienced higher materials, freight and other input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have varied among our businesses relative to significance and duration. Other earnings included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $259 million in 2021, $11.0 billion in 2020 and $435 million in 2019. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Approximately $9.8 billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016. Other earnings in 2021 also included after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of $955 million and after-tax losses of $764 million in 2020 related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). Investment and derivative gains/losses in each of the three years presented predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains from market price changes. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the periodic operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses exceeding $100 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. The significant catastrophe events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida and floods in Europe in the third quarter, as well as Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $125 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. K-33 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Underwriting results of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses were negatively affected in 2021 and 2020 by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including incremental provisions for claims and uncollectible premiums and incremental operating costs to maintain customer service levels. The effects of the pandemic on future periods may be affected by judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurance coverage and claims and by its effects on general economic activity, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss): GEICO $ 1,259 $ 3,428 $ 1,506 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 607 110 383 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (930 ) (2,700 ) (1,472 ) Pre-tax underwriting earnings 936 838 417 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 208 181 92 Net underwriting earnings $ 728 $ 657 $ 325 Effective income tax rate 22.2 % 21.5 % 24.2 % GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 38,395 $ 34,928 $ 36,016 Premiums earned $ 37,706 100.0 $ 35,093 100.0 $ 35,572 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 30,999 82.2 26,018 74.1 28,937 81.3 Underwriting expenses 5,448 14.5 5,647 16.1 5,129 14.5 Total losses and expenses 36,447 96.7 31,665 90.2 34,066 95.8 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 1,259 $ 3,428 $ 1,506 GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings in 2021 and 2020 were significantly affected by changes in average claims frequencies. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies were significantly below historical levels from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects were partially offset by higher average claims severities and lower premiums earned from the GEICO Giveback program, which provided for a 15% premium credit to all voluntary auto and motorcycle new policies or policies renewing between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Starting in the second quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies began to increase as driving by policyholders increased. In addition, average property claims severities increased due to increases in used vehicle valuations. K-34 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) 2021 versus 2020 Premiums written in 2021 increased $3.5 billion (9.9%) compared to 2020, which included a reduction of approximately $2.9 billion attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. Premiums earned in 2021 increased $2.6 billion (7.4%) compared to 2020. The GEICO Giveback Program reduced earned premiums by approximately $2.5 billion in 2020 with the remainder of the impact included in 2021. Voluntary auto policies-in-force in 2021 were slightly higher compared to 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $5.0 billion (19.1%) compared to 2020. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) increased 8.1 percentage points compared to 2020. The increase in the loss ratio reflected an increase in average claims frequencies and severities and higher losses from significant catastrophe events, partially offset by increased reductions of ultimate estimated losses for claims occurring in prior years. Claims frequencies in 2021 were higher for all coverages, including property damage and bodily injury (thirteen to fourteen percent range), personal injury (sixteen to seventeen percent range) and collision (twenty-one to twenty-two percent range). Average claims severities in 2021 were also higher for property damage coverage (two to three percent range), collision coverage (fifteen to sixteen percent range) and bodily injury coverage (eight to ten percent range). Ultimate claim loss estimates for claims occurring in prior years were reduced approximately $1.8 billion in 2021 and $253 million in 2020, which produced corresponding reductions in losses and loss adjustment expenses. Losses incurred attributable to Hurricane Ida in 2021 were $375 million, while losses in 2020 included $81 million attributable to Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. Underwriting expenses decreased $199 million (3.5%) compared to 2020, reflecting lower advertising expenses. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) decreased 1.6 percentage points in 2021, reflecting lower nominal expenses and higher premiums earned. 2020 versus 2019 Premiums written and earned in 2020 decreased $1.1 billion (3.0%) and $479 million (1.3%), respectively, compared to 2019. The GEICO Giveback program reduced premiums written $2.9 billion and premiums earned $2.5 billion in 2020. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 820,000 during 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2020 decreased $2.9 billion (10.1%) compared to 2019. GEICO’s loss ratio was 74.1%, a decrease of 7.2 percentage points compared to 2019. The decrease in the loss ratio reflected declines in claims frequencies, partly offset by increases in claims severities and the impact of lower premiums earned attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. Claims frequencies in 2020 were lower for property damage, bodily injury and personal injury protection coverages (twenty-eight to thirty percent range) and collision coverage (twenty-three to twenty-four percent range) compared to 2019. Average claims severities in 2020 were higher for property damage and collision coverages (eight to ten percent range) and bodily injury coverage (twelve to thirteen percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses included net reductions of $253 million in 2020 for decreases in the ultimate loss estimates for claims occurring in prior years compared to net increases of $42 million in 2019. Losses incurred included $81 million in 2020 from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. There were no losses from significant catastrophe events in 2019. Underwriting expenses in 2020 increased $518 million (10.1%) compared to 2019, reflecting higher employee-related, advertising and technology costs, partly offset by lower premium taxes. GEICO’s expense ratio in 2020 was 16.1%, an increase of 1.6 percentage points compared to 2019. The expense ratio increase was primarily attributable to the decline in earned premiums from the GEICO Giveback program. K-35 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare professional liability, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary’s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”). A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 12,595 $ 10,212 $ 9,843 Premiums earned $ 11,575 100.0 $ 9,615 100.0 $ 9,165 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 8,107 70.0 7,129 74.1 6,336 69.1 Underwriting expenses 2,861 24.8 2,376 24.7 2,446 26.7 Total losses and expenses 10,968 94.8 9,505 98.8 8,782 95.8 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 607 $ 110 $ 383 Premiums written increased $2.4 billion (23.3%) in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting increases from BH Specialty (36%), MedPro Group (16%), NICO Primary (25%), GUARD (7%), BHHC (5%) and USLI (20%). The increases were across multiple coverages and occurred in several markets. Premiums written increased $369 million (3.7%) in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting increased premiums written from BH Specialty (34%) and MedPro Group (9%), partially offset by a 13% decrease in premiums written by our other primary insurers. The decline in volume by our other primary insurers was primarily due to lower workers’ compensation and commercial automobile volumes and the effect of the divestiture of Applied Underwriters in October 2019. BH Primary’s loss ratios were 70.0% in 2021, 74.1% in 2020 and 69.1% in 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to significant catastrophe events were $402 million in 2021 from Hurricane Ida and Winter Storm Uri and $207 million in 2020 from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were reduced $631 million in 2021, $265 million in 2020 and $499 million in 2019 for net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events. Losses in 2020 also included increased liabilities of $167 million attributable to the pandemic. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Underwriting expenses increased $485 million (20.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting the increase in business, changes in business mix and the costs associated with new product development. The expense ratio in 2021 was relatively unchanged versus 2020. The expense ratio in 2020 declined 2.0 percentage points compared to 2019 and reflected changes in business mix and the impact of the Applied Underwriters divestiture. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN. K-36 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the claim liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Premiums written Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Property/casualty $ 14,149 $ 13,295 $ 10,428 $ 13,740 $ 12,214 $ 9,911 $ 667 $ (799 ) $ 16 Life/health 5,621 5,848 4,963 5,648 5,861 4,869 (421 ) (18 ) 159 Retroactive reinsurance 136 38 684 136 38 684 (782 ) (1,248 ) (1,265 ) Periodic payment annuity 658 566 863 658 566 863 (508 ) (617 ) (549 ) Variable annuity 15 14 14 15 14 14 114 (18 ) 167 $ 20,579 $ 19,761 $ 16,952 $ 20,197 $ 18,693 $ 16,341 $ (930 ) $ (2,700 ) $ (1,472 ) Property/casualty A summary of property/casualty reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 14,149 $ 13,295 $ 10,428 Premiums earned $ 13,740 100.0 $ 12,214 100.0 $ 9,911 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 9,878 71.9 9,898 81.0 7,313 73.8 Underwriting expenses 3,195 23.2 3,115 25.5 2,582 26.0 Total losses and expenses 13,073 95.1 13,013 106.5 9,895 99.8 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ 667 $ (799 ) $ 16 Premiums written increased $854 million (6.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to net new business, increased participations and improved prices on renewals and favorable currency translation effects. The increase was primarily attributable to property coverages. Premiums written increased $2.9 billion (27.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to net new business and increased participations on renewals. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were relatively unchanged in 2021 compared to 2020, while the loss ratio decreased 9.1 percentage points. The loss ratio was 71.9% in 2021, 81.0% in 2020 and 73.8% in 2019. Losses incurred arising from significant catastrophe events in 2021 (Hurricane Ida, flooding in Europe and Winter Storm Uri) were $2.1 billion, which were partially offset by reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $718 million. Losses incurred in 2020 included $667 million from significant catastrophe events (Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires), losses attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic of $964 million and increases in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $162 million. Incurred losses from significant catastrophe events during 2019 were $1.0 billion and derived from Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis and various U.S. and non-U.S. wildfires, which were partially offset by reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $295 million. Underwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. The expense ratio in 2021 decreased 2.3 percentage points compared to 2020, primarily attributable to changes in business mix and foreign currency effects. Underwriting expenses increased $533 million (20.6%) in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting the increase in premiums earned. K-37 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 5,621 $ 5,848 $ 4,963 Premiums earned $ 5,648 100.0 $ 5,861 100.0 $ 4,869 100.0 Life and health insurance benefits 4,933 87.3 4,883 83.3 3,800 78.0 Underwriting expenses 1,136 20.2 996 17.0 910 18.7 Total benefits and expenses 6,069 107.5 5,879 100.3 4,710 96.7 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ (421 ) $ (18 ) $ 159 Life/health premiums written decreased $227 million (3.9%) in 2021 compared to 2020. Premiums written in 2020 included $710 million from a contract that covered U.S. health risks that incepted in the fourth quarter of 2019 and did not renew in 2021. Otherwise, premiums written in 2021 increased 9.4% versus 2020, primarily due to volume growth in the Asia Pacific region and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively affected by significant increases in mortality in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America, attributable to the pandemic. Life/health premiums written increased $885 million (17.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019. Approximately $480 million of the increase was attributable to the contract covering U.S. health insurance risks, and the remainder of the increase was primarily from volume growth in Asia and Europe. Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by increased life benefits from COVID-19-related claims and from increased liabilities from changes in underlying assumptions in estimating disability benefit liabilities in Australia, which were mostly offset by lower other life claims and reduced losses from U.S. long-term care business that is in run-off. Results in 2019 included a one-time pre-tax underwriting gain of $163 million attributable to an amendment of a yearly renewable term life contract. Retroactive reinsurance Pre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Underwriting results included pre-tax foreign currency gains of $56 million in 2021 and losses of $139 million in 2020 and $76 million in 2019. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $838 million in 2021, $1.1 billion in 2020 and $1.2 billion in 2019. Estimated ultimate claim liabilities for contracts written in prior years were reduced $974 million in 2021 and $399 million in 2020. After adjustments to the related unamortized deferred charges from changes in the estimated timing and amount of the future claim payments, such reductions produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $142 million in 2021 and $230 million in 2020. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $38.3 billion at December 31, 2021, a decline of $2.7 billion since December 31, 2020. The decline was primarily attributable to paid claims of approximately $1.9 billion and the reduction in estimated ultimate claim liabilities. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $10.6 billion at December 31, 2021, a decline of $1.8 billion since December 31, 2020, attributable to the effects of the changes in the estimated timing and amount of the future claim payments and periodic amortization. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. K-38 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned increased $92 million (16.3%) in 2021 compared to 2020, which decreased $297 million (34.4%) versus 2019. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive. Our premium volumes in 2021 and 2020 were affected by pandemic-related delays in underlying claim settlements, which reduced the supply of available business. Our volumes written may also change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality and interest rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency gains of $18 million in 2021 and losses of $67 million in 2020 and $40 million in 2019. Excluding foreign currency gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $526 million in 2021, $550 million in 2020 and $509 million in 2019. Pre-tax losses in 2021 were partially offset by the effects of higher mortality and by higher interest rates applicable to settlements under certain contracts. Discounted annuity liabilities were $15.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings of $114 million in 2021, losses of $18 million in 2020 and earnings of $167 million in 2019. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. The comparative increase in underwriting earnings in 2021 was primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate changes and, to a lesser extent, changes in securities markets. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019 Interest and other investment income $ 589 $ 1,059 $ 2,075 (44.4 )% (49.0 )% Dividend income 5,060 4,890 4,525 3.5 8.1 Pre-tax net investment income 5,649 5,949 6,600 (5.0 ) (9.9 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 842 910 1,070 Net investment income $ 4,807 $ 5,039 $ 5,530 Effective income tax rate 14.9 % 15.3 % 16.1 % Interest and other investment income declined $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, which in turn, declined $1.0 billion (49.0%) compared to 2019. These declines were primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. Short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020. Low rates prevailed through 2021, which resulted in significantly lower interest income. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. K-39 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Dividend income included $121 million in 2021 and $26 million in 2020 from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. Dividend income may vary from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Dividend income increased $365 million (8.1%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to dividends from the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% cumulative preferred stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) on August 8, 2019, partly offset by lower dividends from common stock investments. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $147 billion at December 31, 2021, $138 billion at December 31, 2020 and $129 billion at December 31, 2019. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings in each of the past three years, and consequently, the average cost of float for each year was negative. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 follows (in millions).

K-40 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with over 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major business groups by type of product shipped including consumer products, industrial products, agricultural products and coal. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019 Railroad operating revenues $ 22,513 $ 20,181 $ 22,745 11.6 % (11.3 )% Railroad operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 4,696 4,542 5,270 3.4 (13.8 ) Fuel 2,766 1,789 2,944 54.6 (39.2 ) Purchased services 2,033 1,954 2,049 4.0 (4.6 ) Depreciation and amortization 2,444 2,460 2,389 (0.7 ) 3.0 Equipment rents, materials and other 1,763 1,684 2,028 4.7 (17.0 ) Total 13,702 12,429 14,680 10.2 (15.3 ) Railroad operating earnings 8,811 7,752 8,065 13.7 (3.9 ) Other revenues (expenses): Other revenues 769 688 770 11.8 (10.6 ) Other expenses, net (687 ) (611 ) (515 ) 12.4 18.6 Interest expense (1,032 ) (1,037 ) (1,070 ) (0.5 ) (3.1 ) Pre-tax earnings 7,861 6,792 7,250 15.7 (6.3 ) Income taxes 1,871 1,631 1,769 14.7 (7.8 ) Net earnings $ 5,990 $ 5,161 $ 5,481 16.1 (5.8 ) Effective income tax rate 23.8 % 24.0 % 24.4 % The following table summarizes BNSF’s railroad freight volumes by business group (cars/units in thousands). Cars/Units Percentage change 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019 Consumer products 5,673 5,266 5,342 7.7 % (1.4 )% Industrial products 1,709 1,622 1,931 5.4 (16.0 ) Agricultural products 1,224 1,189 1,146 2.9 3.8 Coal 1,529 1,404 1,802 8.9 (22.1 ) Total cars/units 10,135 9,481 10,221 6.9 (7.2 ) 2021 versus 2020 Railroad operating revenues increased 11.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting higher volumes of 6.9%, as well as a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit resulting from business mix changes and higher fuel surcharge revenue attributable to higher fuel prices. Pre-tax earnings were $7.9 billion in 2021, an increase of 15.7% from 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant economic slowdown that adversely affected our volumes in 2020. Revenue changes in 2021 were driven by continued improvements from the 2020 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the ongoing disruptions in the global supply chain. K-41 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (Continued) Operating revenues from consumer products increased 13.7% in 2021 to $8.3 billion compared to 2020, reflecting increased volumes of 7.7% and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to growth in intermodal in both international and domestic shipments driven by increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and increased e-commerce activity. Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.0% from 2020. Volumes increased 5.4% while average revenue per car/unit was nearly unchanged from 2020. The volume increase was primarily due to improvement in the U.S. industrial economy, driving higher volumes in the construction and building sectors, partially offset by lower petroleum volumes due to unfavorable market conditions in the energy sector. Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 5.8% to $5.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The revenue change reflected a volume increase of 2.9% due to higher domestic grain shipments and higher volumes of ethanol and related commodities, as well as higher revenue per car/unit. Operating revenues from coal increased 21.5% to $3.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 attributable to higher volumes of 8.9% in 2021, as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase in 2021 was attributable to increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand. Railroad operating expenses were $13.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.3 billion (10.2%) compared to 2020. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased 0.7 percentage points to 60.9% in 2021 versus 2020. The increase in railroad operating expenses reflected higher volumes and higher average fuel prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of productivity improvements. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $154 million (3.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased volumes, wage inflation and health and welfare costs, partially offset by productivity improvements. Fuel expenses increased $977 million (54.6%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher average fuel prices. Purchased service expenses increased $79 million (4.0%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher volumes and the effects of insurance recoveries in 2020 related to 2019 flooding, partially offset by improved productivity. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $79 million (4.7%) compared to 2020, due to higher volume-related costs. 2020 versus 2019 Railroad operating revenues declined 11.3% in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting a 7.2% decrease in volume and a 4.5% decrease in average revenue per car/unit. The decrease in revenue per car/unit was attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue driven by lower fuel prices and business mix changes. The overall volume decrease was primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted volumes through the first half of 2020 and caused significant economic disruptions that adversely affected the demand for transportation services. Volumes sequentially improved during the second half of 2020 from earlier periods and recovered overall to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. Pre-tax earnings were $6.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of 6.3% from 2019, principally due to the negative impacts of the pandemic on volumes. In addition, pre-tax earnings in 2019 included an operating revenue increase related to the favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing and a retirement plan curtailment gain that is included in other expenses, net in the preceding table. These effects were partially offset by significant improvements in 2020 in service, system velocity and cost performance compared to 2019, along with lower costs related to severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network, which negatively affected expenses and service levels in 2019. Operating revenues from consumer products of $7.3 billion in 2020 declined 7.6% compared to 2019, primarily due to a 6.3% decrease in average revenue per car/unit along with lower volumes. The volume decrease was primarily due to the impact of the pandemic. Lower international and automotive volumes were offset by higher domestic intermodal volumes. Increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and e-commerce activity produced recovery of intermodal volumes in the second half of 2020. K-42 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (Continued) Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.0 billion in 2020, a decrease of 17.0% from 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decline in volume and to a lesser extent lower average revenue per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower U.S. industrial production driven by the pandemic, including reduced production and demand in the energy sector, which lowered sand and petroleum products volume, and reduced steel demand, which lowered taconite volume. Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 2.9% to $4.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was due to higher volumes, partially offset by slightly lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to higher grain and meal exports, partially offset by lower ethanol and sweeteners shipments. Operating revenues from coal decreased 28.5% to $2.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower volumes, as well as lower revenues per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower natural gas prices, lower electricity demand driven by the pandemic, utility coal plant retirements and mild temperatures. Railroad operating expenses declined 15.3% to $12.4 billion in 2020 as compared to 2019. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues declined 2.9 percentage points to 61.6% in 2020 versus 2019. Railroad operating expenses in 2020 reflected lower volume-related costs, productivity improvements, the effects of cost control initiatives and improved weather conditions compared to 2019. Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $728 million (13.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower employee counts associated with lower volume and improved workforce productivity. Fuel expenses decreased $1.2 billion (39.2%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved fuel efficiency. Purchased services expense declined $95 million (4.6%) compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume, improved productivity and higher insurance recoveries in 2020 related to network flooding in 2019. Equipment rents, materials and other expense decreased $344 million (17.0%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower volume-related costs, the effects of cost controls and lower personal injury and derailment expenses. Utilities and Energy We currently own a 91.1% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. BHE subsidiaries also operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid in Great Britain. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“LNG interest”), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Three of the natural gas pipeline systems and the LNG interest were acquired on November 1, 2020 from Dominion Energy, Inc. (“BHE GT&S”). Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments. BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. K-43 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 18,935 $ 15,556 $ 15,371 Real estate operating revenue 6,215 5,396 4,473 Other income (loss) (163 ) 79 270 Total revenue 24,987 21,031 20,114 Costs and expense: Energy cost of sales 5,504 4,187 4,586 Energy operating expense 8,535 7,539 6,824 Real estate operating costs and expense 5,710 4,885 4,251 Interest expense 2,054 1,941 1,835 Total costs and expense 21,803 18,552 17,496 Pre-tax earnings 3,184 2,479 2,618 Income tax expense (benefit)* (1,177 ) (1,010 ) (526 ) Net earnings after income taxes 4,361 3,489 3,144 Noncontrolling interests of BHE subsidiaries 399 71 18 Net earnings attributable to BHE 3,962 3,418 3,126 Noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends 467 327 286 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 3,495 $ 3,091 $ 2,840 Effective income tax rate (37.0 )% (40.7 )% (20.1 )% *Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation. The discussion of BHE’s operating results that follows is based on after-tax earnings, reflecting how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated.

After-tax earnings increased $148 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and increased income tax benefits from the impacts of ratemaking as well as higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service. The earnings increase was partially offset by lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction and higher operating expenses. Operating expenses in 2021 reflected increased depreciation expense from the impacts of a deprecation study effective January 1, 2021, and incremental costs associated with wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, offset by lower costs associated with wildfires and a settlement agreement. K-44 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (Continued) PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $145 million compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher retail revenue from increases in customer volumes and higher wholesale and other revenue, partially offset by higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. Retail customer volumes increased 3.1% in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts of weather. MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings increased $65 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and increased income tax benefits, partly offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses included incremental costs associated with wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service and higher natural gas distribution costs, partially offset by lower storm restoration costs. The income tax benefit increases were mainly due to higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, partially offset by the impacts of ratemaking. MEC electric utility margin increased $190 million to $2.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The electric utility margin increase was attributable to higher operating revenue from increases in retail and wholesale customer volumes, as well as favorable wholesale prices, partially offset by higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. Electric retail customer volumes increased 5.8% in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to increased usage by certain industrial customers and the favorable impacts of weather. NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings increased $29 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected lower operating expenses, lower net interest and finance expense and lower income tax expense from the impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by lower electric utility margin. The decreases in operating expenses were mainly due to lower earnings sharing, partially offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service. NV Energy’s electric utility margin decreased $97 million to $1.6 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to revenue reductions from lower base tariff general rates in 2021 and a favorable regulatory decision in 2020, partially offset by a 3.3% increase in electric retail customer volumes. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, higher customer usage and the favorable impacts of weather. Northern Powergrid’s after-tax earnings increased $46 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher tariff rates and units distributed, lower write-offs of gas exploration costs, lower pension expense and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2021, partially offset by the impact of increases in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate. Earnings in 2021 included deferred income tax expense of $109 million related to the enactment in June 2021 of an increase in the income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. Earnings in 2020 included deferred income tax expense of $35 million related to the enactment in July 2020 of an increase in the income tax rate from 17% to 19%, effective April 1, 2020. Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings increased $246 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 included BHE GT&S for the full year compared to two months in 2020. The incremental earnings in 2021 from BHE GT&S were $211 million. In addition, earnings in 2021 reflected the effects of higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas due to increased demand from the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by lower transportation revenue primarily due to lower volumes for the remainder of the year. Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings in 2021 decreased $17 million compared to 2020. The decrease was mainly due to a decline in wind tax equity investment earnings of $56 million, which included increased losses from pre-existing tax equity investments of $165 million, largely attributable to the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. Earnings in 2021 from other energy projects increased due to higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects and a transmission investment, as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2021. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $12 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was due to a comparative increase in closed brokerage transaction volumes in 2021, partially offset by lower funded mortgage volume due to a decrease in refinance activity. Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings increased $15 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to favorable comparative state income tax benefits and higher earnings from non-regulated energy services, offset by higher operating expenses and higher interest expense from corporate debt issued in 2020. K-45 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (Continued) 2020 versus 2019 PacifiCorp after-tax earnings decreased $32 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease reflected higher operating expenses and net interest expense, partially offset by increased production tax credit benefits driven by repowered wind projects placed in-service, higher utility margin and higher other income. The increase in operating expenses was largely due to costs associated with wildfires, a settlement agreement and pension benefits. PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $47 million compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher operating revenue from an increase in average retail prices and lower generation and purchased power costs, partially offset by lower operating revenue from a decline in retail customer volumes. The decline in retail customer volumes was due to the impacts of the pandemic, partly offset by an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts of weather. MEC after-tax earnings increased $37 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected increased income tax benefits, primarily from production tax credits, driven by repowered and new wind projects placed in-service, and the effects of ratemaking. These effects were partially offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service, higher net interest expense, lower other income and lower electric and natural gas utility margins. MEC electric utility margin decreased $10 million to $1.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The electric utility margin decrease was attributable to lower operating revenue from unfavorable wholesale prices and price impacts from changes in retail sales mix. These effects were mostly offset by lower generation and purchased power costs and higher operating revenue from a 1.2% increase in retail customer volumes. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to increased usage by certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic. Natural gas utility margin decreased $9 million in 2020 compared to 2019, due to the unfavorable impacts of weather. NV Energy after-tax earnings increased $45 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and lower income tax expense from the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher earnings sharing accruals for customers at Nevada Power Company and higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service. NV Energy electric utility margin increased $100 million to $1.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher operating revenue from a 1.5% increase in electric retail customer volumes, including distribution-only service customers and price impacts from changes in retail sales mix. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to the favorable impacts of weather, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic. Northern Powergrid after-tax earnings decreased $55 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The earnings decrease reflected write-offs of gas exploration costs and higher income tax expense, in large part from a change in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate, partially offset by lower pension costs and interest expense. Natural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $106 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to $73 million of earnings from BHE GT&S, the favorable impact of a rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas and higher transportation volume and rates, partially offset by higher depreciation, operating expenses and interest expenses. Other energy business after-tax earnings in 2020 increased $89 million compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation, partially offset by lower operating revenue and higher operating expenses from geothermal and natural gas units. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $215 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher earnings from mortgage and brokerage services. The increase in earnings from mortgage services was attributable to higher refinance activity from the favorable interest rate environment and the earnings increase from brokerage services was due to an increase of 13.1% in closed transaction dollar volume. Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $113 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was primarily due to higher interest expense and lower state income tax benefits.

These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page K-32 and in the “Other Berkshire corporate” earnings section on page K-56. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019 Revenues Industrial products $ 28,176 $ 25,667 $ 30,594 9.8 % (16.1 )% Building products 24,974 21,244 20,327 17.6 4.5 Consumer products 15,580 12,168 11,809 28.0 3.0 $ 68,730 $ 59,079 $ 62,730 Pretax earnings Industrial products $ 4,469 $ 3,755 $ 5,635 19.0 % (33.4 )% Building products 3,390 2,858 2,636 18.6 8.4 Consumer products 1,982 1,397 1,251 41.9 11.7 $ 9,841 $ 8,010 $ 9,522 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Industrial products 15.9 % 14.6 % 18.4 % Building products 13.6 % 13.5 % 13.0 % Consumer products 12.7 % 11.5 % 10.6 % K-47 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). 2021 versus 2020 Revenues of the industrial products group in 2021 increased $2.5 billion (9.8%) from 2020. Pre-tax earnings increased $714 million (19.0%) compared to 2020 and pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2021 was 15.9%, an increase of 1.3 percentage points compared 2020. PCC’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, a decrease of $853 million (11.6%) compared to 2020. Historically, PCC has derived significant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) aircraft production in 2021 and 2020. While commercial air travel increased in both the U.S. and international markets in 2021 versus 2020, demand remains well below pre-pandemic levels, especially for international routes. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for travel, however, the recovery has been uneven between domestic and international markets. Air traffic recovery will continue to be impacted by the pandemic, though likely more on a seasonal or localized basis as the pandemic shifts to an endemic phase. Near term recovery in build rates will lag recovery in air travel due to the significant finished goods inventory following quality issues with the Boeing 737 and Boeing 787 planes and industry supply chain issues. PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 78.8% compared to 2020. The increase reflects the actions taken by management to resize, restructure and improve operations and to prepare for more normalized demand for PCC’s products, as well as from a decline in restructuring costs. We do not expect significant increases in PCC’s aerospace revenues or earnings to occur in the near term, primarily due to the relatively low aircraft build rates related to Boeing’s significant inventory levels and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial air travel. Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2020. The increase reflects higher average selling prices, driven by significant increases in materials and other manufacturing costs, as well as slightly higher volumes. Sales volumes in the Additives product lines were negatively affected by severe winter storms in February 2021, which caused the temporary shut-down of several U.S. facilities, as well as other temporary production shut-downs in the second half of 2021. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 decreased 50.8% compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 included significant losses related to a fire in June 2021 at a facility of Chemtool Incorporated, a Lubrizol subsidiary, located in Rockton, Illinois and impairment charges in the second half of 2021 related to an underperforming business in the Advanced Materials product lines. These losses and charges aggregated $257 million in 2021. Earnings in 2021 were also negatively impacted by the effects of accelerating raw material costs and the previously mentioned temporary shut-down of Additives production facilities, which resulted in lost sales and incremental manufacturing costs. Marmon’s revenues were $9.8 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.1 billion (27.9%) compared to 2020. Revenues in 2021 from the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups increased 54% over 2020, accounting for over half of the aggregate increase in Marmon’s revenues. These increases were attributable to higher volumes and prices, including the impact of significantly higher average copper and metal prices. Revenues of most of Marmon’s other groups, particularly those serving the construction, automotive, heavy-duty truck and restaurant markets, also increased in 2021, reflecting higher volumes and favorable foreign currency translation effects. These increases were partially offset by the impact of divestitures and business closures in the Water Technologies and Retail Solutions groups and lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting fewer railcars on lease and changes in lease mix. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 increased 40.3% compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to earnings increases in the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups due to higher volumes and average margins. Earnings of several other business groups also increased attributable to higher sales volumes, sales mix changes and lower restructuring charges, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Water Technologies groups. K-48 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) IMC’s revenues increased 19.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting improving business conditions in most geographic regions and favorable foreign currency translation effects. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 47.7% in 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to higher customer demand, improved manufacturing efficiencies, operating cost management saving initiatives and favorable foreign currency translation effects. 2020 versus 2019 Revenues of the industrial products group in 2020 declined $4.9 billion (16.1%) from 2019, while pre-tax earnings declined $1.9 billion (33.4%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group was 14.6% in 2020 compared to 18.4% in 2019. PCC’s revenues were $7.3 billion in 2020, a decrease of $3.0 billion (28.9%) compared to 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and aircraft production. Airlines responded to the pandemic by delaying delivery of aircraft orders or, in some cases, cancelling aircraft orders, resulting in significant reductions in build rates by aircraft manufacturers and significant inventory reduction initiatives by PCC’s customers. Further, Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft production issues contributed to the declines in aerospace product sales across the industry in 2020. These factors resulted in significant declines in demand for PCC’s aerospace products in 2020. PCC’s sales of products for power markets increased 2.2% in 2020, primarily driven by increases in industrial gas turbine products, offset by reductions in oil and gas products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings were $650 million in 2020, a decrease of 64.5% compared to 2019, which reflected the decline in aerospace product sales as well as increased manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to lower volumes. In response to the effects of the pandemic, PCC took aggressive restructuring actions to resize operations in response to reduced expected volumes in aerospace markets. PCC’s worldwide workforce was reduced by about 40% from the end of 2019. PCC recorded restructuring, inventory and fixed asset charges of approximately $295 million in 2020. Earnings as a percentage of revenues were negatively impacted in 2020 due to inefficiencies associated with aligning operations to reduced aircraft build rates. Lubrizol’s revenues were $5.95 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.0% compared to 2019. The decline was primarily attributable to lower volumes from economic effects of the pandemic and a fire at an Additives manufacturing, blending and storage facility in Rouen, France at the end of the third quarter of 2019, which resulted in the temporary suspension of operations. Revenues in 2020 also reflected lower selling prices, partly offset by favorable changes in sales mix. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume for the year declined 9% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to declines in the Additives and Engineered Materials product lines, partly offset by higher volumes in Life Science products. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 were approximately $1.0 billion, essentially unchanged compared to 2019. The effects of lower sales volumes, including the effects from the Rouen fire, and lower average selling prices were offset by lower average raw material costs, lower operating expenses and insurance recoveries in 2020 associated with the Rouen fire. Marmon’s revenues were $7.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of $681 million (8.2%) compared to 2019. Excluding the effects of business acquisitions, revenues decreased in essentially all groups, primarily attributable to lower demand from the effects of the pandemic. The largest effects were experienced in the Transportation Products and Foodservice Technologies groups. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower metal prices in the Metal Services group and the effect of business divestitures in 2019. Declines in oil prices in 2020 also adversely affected demand and revenues in the Rail & Leasing and Crane Services groups. Marmon acquired the Colson Medical companies on October 31, 2019, which represents Marmon’s Medical group. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 decreased $312 million (24.3%) compared to 2019. The decrease reflected the declines in revenues and increased restructuring charges. Restructuring initiatives were initiated in response to the lower product demand, particularly in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic. K-49 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) IMC’s revenues declined 13.2% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting negative economic effects from the pandemic on demand for cutting tools in most geographic regions, partly offset by the effects of business acquisitions. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 26.6% in 2020 versus 2019, attributable to declines in sales and margins due to lower volumes and to changes in sales mix. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). 2021 versus 2020 Revenues of the building products group increased $3.7 billion (17.6%) in 2021 and pre-tax earnings increased $532 million (18.6%) compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.6% in 2021 and 13.5% in 2020. During 2021, our businesses experienced strong customer demand and higher sales volumes. We also experienced various forms of supply chain disruptions, which affected the general economy, and contributed to considerable raw material and logistics cost inflation and supply constraints. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $10.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.9 billion (22.2%) over 2020. Revenues from home sales increased $1.8 billion (26.5%) in 2021 to approximately $8.3 billion, reflecting increased revenue per home sold, changes in sales mix and a net increase in new units sold. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 15.8% in 2021, while factory-built manufactured home unit sales increased 1.5%. Site-built home unit sales were constrained by longer construction periods arising from supply chain constraints and labor shortages. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 7.8% in 2021 compared to 2020. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $18.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $1.7 billion compared to December 31, 2020. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $440 million (35.3%) compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 reflected higher earnings from home sales, mortgage originations, net interest income and lower provisions for expected credit losses, partially offset by the impact of rising manufacturing and supply chain costs. The provision for expected credit losses in 2020 was unusually high and included provisions for the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The comparative decline in the provision for expected credit losses was due to fewer actual and anticipated loan foreclosures. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $14.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 14.4% versus 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by significantly higher input and supply chain costs, as well as higher unit volumes for paint and coatings, flooring, insulation, roofing and other engineered products. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.7% over 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues was 11.8% in 2021, a 1.0 percentage point decrease compared to 2020. While customer demand in 2021 was generally strong, reduced availability of materials and other product inputs from supply chain disruptions negatively affected sales and operating results. In addition, higher costs for raw materials and freight and higher restructuring and impairment charges contributed to the reduction in our pre-tax margin rates. 2020 versus 2019 Revenues of the building products group increased $917 million (4.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings increased $222 million (8.4%) over 2019. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.5% in 2020 and 13.0% in 2019. K-50 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $8.6 billion in 2020, an increase of $1.3 billion (17.1%) over 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases in home sales of $1.0 billion (18.4%), driven by increases in units sold and revenue per home sold and by changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 28.6% in 2020 over 2019, while revenue per home increased slightly. Manufactured home unit sales increased 2.8% in 2020. Financial services revenues increased 13.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, attributable to increased loan originations and average outstanding loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $17.1 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $15.9 billion as of December 31, 2019. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.25 billion in 2020, an increase of $152 million (13.9%) compared to 2019. The earnings increase reflected higher earnings from home sales, partly offset by higher materials costs, which lowered manufactured housing gross margin rates. Earnings in 2020 also benefitted from increased interest income, lower interest expense and higher earnings from mortgage services, partly offset by increased provisions for credit and insurance losses. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $12.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of 2.6% versus 2019. The revenue decrease reflected lower flooring volumes, in part attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by increased paint and coatings volumes, including volumes from a new agreement with Ace Hardware Stores, and increased volumes in residential markets. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 4.6% over 2019. The earnings increase reflected the effects of lower average input costs, operating cost containment efforts and lower facilities closure costs. Consumer products The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). 2021 versus 2020 Consumer products revenues increased $3.4 billion (28.0%) in 2021 versus 2020. Revenues from Forest River increased 40.2% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by a 27.6% increase in recreational vehicle unit sales and higher average selling prices, primarily due to significant increases in manufacturing costs. Revenues of several of our other consumer products businesses were significantly higher in 2021 as compared to 2020. The initial impacts of the pandemic in the first half of 2020 from temporary retail store closures and reduced demand had a severe impact on most of these businesses. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 25.3% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting significant increases in unit sales, partly attributable to inventory restocking by certain customers, and from increased consumer demand. Revenues from Richline increased 39.9%, while revenues from Duracell increased 2.4%. Consumer products pre-tax earnings increased $585 million (41.9%) in 2021 compared to 2020 and as a percentage of revenues in 2021 increased 1.2 percentage points to 12.7%. The increase reflected significant earnings increases at many of our businesses, driven by Forest River, the apparel and footwear businesses, Richline and Larson-Juhl. However, our consumer products businesses, particularly the apparel and footwear businesses, also experienced significant cost increases and supply chain disruptions, causing pre-tax margins in the second half of 2021 to be 1.1 percentage points lower than in the first half of the year. 2020 versus 2019 Consumer products revenues increased $359 million (3.0%) in 2020 versus 2019, while pre-tax earnings increased $146 million (11.7%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2020 increased 0.9 percentage points to 11.5%. K-51 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Consumer products (Continued) The comparative increase in revenues reflected increases from Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower apparel and footwear revenues. Forest River revenues increased 11.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily attributable to a significant increase in recreational vehicle unit sales over the last half of the year and changes in sales mix. Unit sales in the second half of 2020 increased 31% over the second half of 2019. Revenues from Duracell increased 10.0% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting the effects of changes in sales mix and increased volume. Apparel and footwear revenues declined 6.1% in 2020 compared to 2019. Apparel and footwear sales volumes in the first half of 2020, particularly in the second quarter, reflected the negative effects of the pandemic, which included retail store closures, reduced or cancelled orders and pandemic-related disruptions at certain manufacturing facilities. Sales recovered somewhat in the second half of 2020, attributable to higher consumer demand and inventory restocking by retailers. Brooks Sports revenues were higher, partly attributable to the effect of the reduced sales in 2019 that were caused by shipping delays at a new distribution facility. Pre-tax earnings were $1.4 billion in 2020, an increase of $146 million (11.7%) compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower earnings from apparel and footwear. The overall increase reflected the effects of sales volumes changes and ongoing expense management efforts. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019 Revenues Service $ 15,872 $ 12,346 $ 13,496 28.6 % (8.5 )% Retailing 18,960 15,832 15,991 19.8 (1.0 ) McLane 49,450 46,840 50,458 5.6 (7.2 ) $ 84,282 $ 75,018 $ 79,945 Pre-tax earnings Service $ 2,672 $ 1,600 $ 1,681 67.0 % (4.8 )% Retailing 1,809 1,028 874 76.0 17.6 McLane 230 251 288 (8.4 ) (12.8 ) $ 4,711 $ 2,879 $ 2,843 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Service 16.8 % 13.0 % 12.5 % Retailing 9.5 % 6.5 % 5.5 % McLane 0.5 % 0.5 % 0.6 % Service Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). K-52 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service (Continued) 2021 versus 2020 Service group revenues increased $3.5 billion (28.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to higher revenues from TTI and the aviation services businesses. Revenues from TTI increased 37.4% in 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to significantly higher volumes across all significant markets and product categories, and to a lesser extent, higher average prices and changes in sales mix. Customer demand accelerated throughout 2021, as customers attempted to maintain adequate inventories in response to high demand for components in end products and effects of supply chain disruptions. Revenues from aviation services increased 27.5% in 2021 over low 2020 levels, primarily due to higher training hours (24%) and customer flight hours (70%). Pre-tax earnings of our service business group increased $1.1 billion (67.0%) to $2.7 billion. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 16.8% in 2021, an increase of 3.8 percentage points compared to 2020. Earnings at nearly all service businesses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, with the largest increases from TTI, the aviation services businesses and the XTRA leasing business. TTI’s earnings increase was primarily attributable to the increases in sales volumes, as well as from improved operating cost leverage and changes in sales mix. The increase in earnings from aviation services was attributable to the favorable effects of higher volume, changes in business mix, increased operating efficiencies, lower impairment charges and the effects of past restructuring efforts, partly offset by higher subcontractor costs attributable to the significant increase in flight demand. 2020 versus 2019 Service group revenues declined $1.15 billion (8.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings decreased $81 million (4.8%). Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 13.0% in 2020, an increase of 0.5 percentage points compared to 2019. The aggregate revenues of NetJets and FlightSafety in 2020 declined $816 million (13.5%) compared to 2019, reflecting lower demand for air travel and aviation services attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. NetJets experienced a decline in customer flight hours of 27% and FlightSafety’s commercial and corporate simulator training hours declined 30% from 2019. The comparative service group revenue decline also reflected the disposition of the newspaper operations in March of 2020 and lower revenues from CORT, which was driven by lower demand attributable to the pandemic. These declines were partially offset by revenue increases from TTI and WPLG. The decline in earnings reflected lower earnings from NetJets, TTI and CORT and the divestiture of the newspaper operations, partly offset by higher earnings from XTRA, Business Wire, WPLG and FlightSafety. TTI’s earnings decline reflected lower average gross margin rates, attributable to product mix changes and sales price pressures deriving from ample inventory availability. The decline at NetJets was primarily attributable to increased asset impairment charges and restructuring costs, partly offset by lower general and administrative expenses and a slight net increase in margins. The decline at CORT was driven by lower revenues, partly offset by the effects of cost control initiatives. The increase at FlightSafety was attributable to the effects of contract losses of approximately $165 million recorded in 2019 with respect to an existing government contract and cost control efforts in 2020, which more than offset significantly lower earnings from commercial and corporate training services. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), representing 62% of our combined retailing revenue in 2021. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 21% of the combined retailing revenues in 2021. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. K-53 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) 2021 versus 2020 Retailing group revenues in 2021 increased $3.1 billion (19.8%) compared to 2020. BHA’s revenues increased 19.0% in 2021 compared to 2020, with vehicle sales, service and repair, and finance and service contract revenues each increasing versus 2020. Revenues from vehicle sales in 2021 increased $1.7 billion (20.7%) versus 2020, primarily due to higher average selling prices, as well as a 2.7% increase in units sold. However, new vehicle unit sales in the second half of 2021 declined 18% compared to the second half of 2020, reflecting significant new vehicle supply shortages at OEMs attributable to the global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Home furnishings group revenues increased 22.0% in 2021 as compared to 2020, attributable to higher consumer demand and higher average selling prices, driven by higher inventory and freight costs. Pre-tax earnings in 2021 of the retailing group increased $781 million (76.0%) from 2020 and the pre-tax margin rate increased 3.0 percentage points to 9.5%. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 47.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased vehicle sales margins and higher earnings from finance and service contract activities. In addition, earnings in 2021 benefitted from lower floorplan interest expense, attributable to significant declines in inventory levels, and from ongoing operating cost control efforts. Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased 67.6% in 2021 versus 2020, reflecting generally higher average gross margin rates and sales mix changes and cost control efforts, partly offset by higher personnel costs. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $321 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The initial effects of the pandemic in 2020 were severe for most of our other retailers due to the restricted operations at many of those businesses. Results in 2021 also benefitted from relatively strong consumer demand and the effects of restructuring efforts in 2020. 2020 versus 2019 Retailing group revenues in 2020 declined $159 million (1.0%) compared to 2019. The spread of COVID-19 resulted in the temporary closures or restricted operations at several of our retailing businesses and effected consumer spending patterns during 2020. The severity and duration of the effects from the pandemic varied widely at our retail operations. BHA’s revenues decreased 2.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. BHA’s revenues in 2020 reflected decreases in new and pre-owned vehicle sales of 2.6%, as well as lower vehicle service and repair revenues. Home furnishings revenues were essentially unchanged in 2020 compared to 2019. The retailing group experienced lower revenues in the first half of 2020, attributable to restricted store hours, which were substantially offset by increased revenues over the second half of the year. However, supply chain disruptions had a negative effect on obtaining product at certain times, which negatively affected sales levels. The effects of the pandemic contributed to significantly lower sales in 2020 for our jewelry stores, See’s Candies and Oriental Trading Company, which were more than offset by significant revenue increases from Pampered Chef and Louis. Sales volumes generally increased and operating results improved beginning in the latter part of the second quarter as our operations slowly reopened. Retail group pre-tax earnings increased $154 million (17.6%) in 2020 from 2019. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 37.7%, primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses, lower floorplan interest expense and higher average gross sales margin rates. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased 1.1% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting higher earnings from the home furnishings businesses and from Pampered Chef, which were substantially offset by lower earnings from our other retailing operations. Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased $79 million (36%) in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting generally higher average gross margin rates, sales mix changes and fewer sales promotions and lower advertising and other operating expenses. Certain of our other operations, including Pampered Chef and Louis experienced significant earnings increases in 2020, while others, including See’s Candies and Oriental Trading Company, experienced significant declines driven by the negative effects of the pandemic. K-54 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) McLane McLane Company, Inc. (“McLane”) operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised about 63% of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2021 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. 2021 versus 2020 Revenues increased $2.6 billion (5.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues from the grocery business increased 1.5% compared to 2020, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 13.1% and 17.8%, respectively. The foodservice business was significantly impacted by pandemic-related restaurant closures in 2020. Pre-tax earnings decreased $21 million (8.4%) in 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease reflected significant increases in personnel, contract transportation and fuel costs, which more than offset the favorable impact of higher sales and slightly higher gross sales margins. McLane’s grocery and food service operations were significantly affected in 2021 by upstream supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages, which contributed to higher inventory costs reflected in a LIFO inventory reserve increase of $130 million, and disruptions in inventory availability. These upstream supply chain effects, together with the truck driver and warehouse personnel shortages that we are experiencing, adversely affected our customer service levels and reduced our operating efficiencies. In response, our hiring and wage and benefits costs increased significantly in 2021. The increase in fuel expense was primarily attributable to significant increases in petroleum prices. We expect the current difficult operating environment to continue through 2022. 2020 versus 2019 Revenues declined $3.6 billion (7.2%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was attributable to COVID-19-related restaurant closures (particularly in the casual dining category) in the foodservice business and lower sales in certain product categories within the grocery business. McLane operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year and 2020 included 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in 2019. Otherwise, revenues declined 5.2% in the grocery business and 7.7% in the foodservice business in 2020 as compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings decreased $37 million (12.8%) in 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings decrease included the effects of increased LIFO inventory reserves of $22 million, credit and inventory losses of $12 million in the foodservice operations and the impact of lower sales. Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative contract gains/losses follows (dollars in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Investment gains/losses $ 77,576 $ 40,905 $ 71,123 Derivative contract gains/losses 966 (159 ) 1,484 Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 78,542 40,746 72,607 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 16,202 9,155 15,162 Net earnings $ 62,340 $ 31,591 $ 57,445 Effective income tax rate 20.4 % 21.7 % 20.9 % K-55 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses (Continued) Investment gains/losses Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains/losses included net unrealized gains of approximately $76.4 billion in 2021, $55.0 billion in 2020 and $69.6 billion in 2019 attributable to changes in market prices of equity securities we held at the end of each year. In each year, we also recorded pre-tax gains and losses from market value changes during each year on equity securities sold during such year, including gains of $1.0 billion in 2021, losses of $14.0 billion in 2020 and gains of $1.6 billion in 2019. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold, which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $3.6 billion in 2021, $6.2 billion in 2020 and $3.2 billion in 2019. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our periodic consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings, including the changes in market prices for equity securities, in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative contract gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. A vast majority of these contracts have since expired. Contracts comprising 63% of the remaining notional value as of December 31, 2021 will expire in the first quarter of 2022. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and, historically, were significant, primarily due to the volatility of underlying equity markets. As of December 31, 2021, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was near zero and our recorded liability at fair value was approximately $99 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. The pre-tax gains and losses in each of the past three years reflected changes in the equity index values and shorter remaining contract durations. Settlement payments to counterparties over the past three years were insignificant. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Equity method earnings $ 881 $ 665 $ 1,023 Acquisition accounting expenses (690 ) (783 ) (788 ) Goodwill and intangible asset impairments — (10,381 ) (96 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (305 ) (334 ) (280 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes 955 (764 ) 58 Other Berkshire corporate 474 279 507 $ 1,315 $ (11,318 ) $ 424 After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia, Electric Transmission of Texas and Iroquois Gas Transmission Systems. Our after-tax earnings from Kraft Heinz were $317 million in 2021, $170 million in 2020 and $488 million in 2019. Our earnings from Kraft Heinz included our after-tax share of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz in each year. Our after-tax share of such charges was $259 million in 2021, $611 million in 2020 and $339 million in 2019. K-56 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other (Continued) After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2020 included after-tax charges of $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets that were recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. See Other Critical Accounting Policies on page K-62 for additional details. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Berkshire corporate items consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021 was $506.2 billion, an increase of $63.0 billion since December 31, 2020. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $89.8 billion and included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $61.6 billion. Over each of the last three years, investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities produced exceptional volatility in our periodic earnings. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $27.1 billion in 2021 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. At December 31, 2021, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $143.9 billion, which included $119.6 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $367.2 billion. Our fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2021 included approximately $14.4 billion of investments that mature in 2022 and 2023. Our consolidated borrowings at December 31, 2021 were $114.3 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. Expected principal and interest payments related to our consolidated borrowings in each of the next five years are (in billions): $10.2 in 2022; $14.6 in 2023; $9.7 in 2024; $9.9 in 2025; and $8.7 in 2026. Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 was $21.4 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion since December 31, 2020, which was primarily due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt. In 2021, Berkshire repaid Euro and U.S. Dollar denominated debt aggregating approximately $2.2 billion of maturing senior notes and issued Euro and Yen denominated senior notes aggregating approximately $2.2 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2041 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $600 million of maturing senior notes and issued ¥128.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were approximately $17.9 billion at December 31, 2021, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $13.1 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In 2021, BHFC repaid $750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $750 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2051. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. K-57 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2020. During 2021, BNSF repaid $1.54 billion of debt and issued $1.55 billion of debentures with a weighted average interest rate of 3.1% with maturity dates in 2051 and 2052. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $51.8 billion at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $382 million since December 31, 2020. In 2021, BHE and its subsidiaries issued new term debt of approximately $2.2 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2028 to 2052 and repaid term debt of approximately $2.5 billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. In each of the past three years, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of approximately $39 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $13.3 billion in 2021, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $9.5 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast capital expenditures of these two operations will approximate $11.1 billion in 2022. Contractual Obligations We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next five years are (in billions): $1.6 in 2022; $1.5 in 2023; $1.4 in 2024; $1.2 in 2025; and $1.2 in 2026. We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $125 billion at December 31, 2021. We currently forecast claim payments in 2022 of approximately $29 billion with respect to claims occurring prior to 2022. Additionally, we estimate net payments of approximately $3 billion in 2022 for life, health and annuity benefits under contracts. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of December 31, 2021, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. We estimate future payments associated with these contracts over the next five years of approximately $19 billion, including $8 billion in 2022. We also have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% of Pilot in 2023 and agreements to acquire certain non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these commitments. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significant degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2021 follows. Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for loss events occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment and settlement process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities, which may require significant judgments and assumptions. As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for claims not yet reported. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails. K-58 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Our consolidated claim liabilities, including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance contracts, as of December 31, 2021 were approximately $125 billion, of which 80% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid losses of these businesses follows. GEICO GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December 31, 2021, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses were $23.9 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $22.7 billion. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies. Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2021, case development liabilities averaged approximately 34% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities. Incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2020 were reduced by $1.8 billion during 2021, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2021 reflect the most recent frequency and severity estimates. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated. With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average claims severities will change by at least one percentage point from the projected severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2021. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $290 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through NICO and General Re. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2021 follows (in millions). Property Casualty Total Reported case liabilities $ 6,602 $ 9,630 $ 16,232 IBNR liabilities 6,780 15,227 22,007 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 13,382 24,857 38,239 Reinsurance recoverable 181 892 1,073 Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 13,201 $ 23,965 $ 37,166 K-59 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Reinsurance contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess contracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR loss estimates. Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. In the U.S., such reporting is generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. To the extent that reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, further delays in claims reporting may occur. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage, and for other reasons. As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain certain internal procedures to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance assumed requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. We generally rely on the ceding companies’ reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2021, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $700 million for certain legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates. Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, we use a variety of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data and other benchmarks, as appropriate. The estimate of the IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories: K-60 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Paid and incurred loss development methods – these methods consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns. Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods – these methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses. Frequency and severity methods – these methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses. Additional analysis – in some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis, determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgement on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events. Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications. In 2021, certain workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $136 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.0 billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. For other casualty losses, excluding asbestos, environmental, and other latent injury claims, we reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ events by approximately $375 million in 2021. For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $950 million, although outcomes of greater than or less than $950 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business. The change in estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts was not significant in 2021. Net liabilities for such claims were approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2021. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. K-61 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities associated with our retroactive reinsurance contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-tails to be very long. As of December 31, 2021, gross unpaid losses were $38.3 billion and deferred charges were $10.6 billion. Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $54 billion. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our estimated gross liability. We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expected results are revealed. Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.3 billion at December 31, 2021. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities. We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $974 million in 2021, which after the changes in related deferred charges, resulted in pre-tax earnings of $142 million. In 2021, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $1.9 billion with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts. In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charges, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortize deferred charges, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments and the effects of the adjustments are included in pre-tax earnings. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2021, we estimate that amortization expense in 2022 will approximate $950 million. Other Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.9 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.5 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more-likely-not there has been an impairment. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss. K-62 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) As of December 31, 2021, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The fair value estimates of reporting units are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on the reporting unit’s business, as well as other assumptions concerning the long-term economic performance of the reporting unit, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2021, the estimated fair values of five reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). The estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $34.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $31.1 billion by 10.7%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the four other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $2.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $2.3 billion by 9.2%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.2 billion. In the second quarter of 2020, we quantitively reevaluated goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, and most significantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10.0 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million, of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC. Prior to the reevaluation, the carrying value of PCC-related goodwill was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, the carrying value of PCC-related indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of these amounts were recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of PCC in 2016. The initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers were particularly severe. At that time, we considered several factors in our reevaluation, including but not limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand, employment levels and aircraft orders, announcements by manufacturers of reduced aircraft production, and the actions we were taking or may be taking in the future to restructure operations. Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing for impairments. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Equity Price Risk Equity securities represent a significant portion of our consolidated investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each company. Historically, equity investments have been concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2021, approximately 73% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in four companies. We often hold our equity securities for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. K-63 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Equity Price Risk (Continued) We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts, although our equity price exposure has declined significantly as a vast majority of the contracts written to date have expired. Our ultimate liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date. The fair values of our liabilities arising from these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors. The following table summarizes our equity securities and equity index put option contract liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions. Fair Value Hypothetical Price Change Estimated Fair Value after Hypothetical Change in Prices Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Net Earnings (1) December 31, 2021 Investments in equity securities $ 350,719 30% increase $ 452,936 $ 81,136 30% decrease 248,606 (81,053 ) Equity index put option contract liabilities 99 30% increase 5 74 30% decrease 1,088 (781 ) December 31, 2020 Investments in equity securities $ 281,170 30% increase $ 362,830 $ 63,321 30% decrease 199,547 (63,293 ) Equity index put option contract liabilities 1,065 30% increase 257 638 30% decrease 2,702 (1,293 ) (1) The estimated increase (decrease) is after income taxes at the statutory rate in effect as of the balance sheet date. Interest Rate Risk We may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit ratings, in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks and we do not attempt to match maturities of assets and liabilities. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risks associated with the valuations of our equity index put option contract liabilities are no longer considered significant due to the short duration of remaining exposures as of December 31, 2021. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. K-64 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Interest Rate Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2021 and 2020. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and do not use derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risks in a meaningful way. K-65 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Foreign Currency Risk (Continued) Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and service subsidiaries. A portion of our financial statement translation-related impact from changes in foreign currency rates is recorded in other comprehensive income. In addition, we include gains or losses from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in net earnings related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities of Berkshire and U.S.-based subsidiaries. A summary of these gains (losses), after-tax, for each of the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020 follows (in millions). 2021 2020 Non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings $ 955 $ (764 ) Net liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts included in net earnings 58 (163 ) Foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income (1,021 ) 1,264 Commodity Price Risk Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risks to any significant degree. Item 7A.
