40533,GD,GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP,2013,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSFor an overview of our business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTAs approximately two-thirds of our revenues are from the U.S. government, our financial performance is impacted by the level of U.S. defense spending. Currently, the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense (DoD), is operating under a continuing resolution (CR) that provides funding at fiscal year (FY) 2012 levels through March 2013. A CR does not generally fund new program starts or new multi-year contracts. A series of CRs over the past several years has negatively impacted the flow of contract awards, particularly in our shorter-cycle Information Systems and Technology business group. While U.S. military budgets are generally driven by national security requirements, the country’s current fiscal shortfall is negatively influencing defense spending. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) mandated a $487 billion, or approximately 8 percent, reduction to previously-planned defense funding over the next decade. These cuts were incorporated into the FY 2013 proposed defense budget. In addition, the BCA included a sequester mechanism that would impose an additional $500 billion of defense cuts over nine years starting in FY 2013, which represents approximately 9 percent of planned defense funding over the period. If sequestration is triggered, the FY 2013 defense budget could be lowered by as much as $40 to $50 billion, or approximately 9 percent. However, how these reductions would be implemented has not been defined. Congress recently extended the deadline for resolving sequestration to March 1, 2013. As of February 7, 2013, a solution has not been identified. For FY 2013, the President requested total defense funding of $525 billion, which is down from FY 2012 funding of $531 billion. We anticipate that Congress will consider the FY 2013 defense spending bill in conjunction with the expiration of the current CR at the end of March. At that time, the CR will either be extended through the government’s year end, thereby keeping FY 2013 spending at FY 2012 levels, or the FY 2013 funding bill will be passed. The President has not yet published the FY 2014 budget request, although the FY 2014 topline mandated by budget reduction legislation is $527 billion. Because budget expenditures lag congressional funding, our associated revenues and earnings in a given year do not correspond directly with the current year budgeted amounts. In addition to the impact of U.S. budget deficit reduction negotiations, defense spending decisions over the next several years may also be shaped by the ongoing Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), an analysis of military priorities and requirements commissioned every four years. We expect defense funding requirements to continue to be influenced by the following:•the imperative to provide support for the warfighter in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment, including the DoD’s increased emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region;•the number of troops deployed globally, coupled with the overall size of the U.S. military;•the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001; and •the need to modernize defense infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern-day warfare, including an emphasis on soldier survivability, enhanced battlefield communications and new 26technologies in the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, unmanned systems and cyberspace arenas.Despite these budget uncertainties, the long-term outlook for our U.S. defense business is buoyed by the relevance of our programs to the military’s funding priorities, the diversity of our programs and customers within the budget, our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs, our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution.We continue to pursue opportunities presented by international demand for military equipment and information technologies from our indigenous international operations and through exports from our U.S. businesses. While the revenue potential can be significant, international defense budgets, much like U.S. budgets, are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing, changing priorities and overall spending pressures. As a result of the demonstrated success of our products and services, we would expect our international sales and exports to grow subject to overall economic conditions.In our Aerospace group, business-jet market conditions were steady in 2012. The group benefited from robust flying hours across the installed base of Gulfstream aircraft, improved large-cabin order interest from North American corporate customers and lower customer contract defaults. We expect our continued investment in new aircraft products to support Aerospace’s long-term growth, as evidenced by the group’s newest aircraft offerings, the G280 and the G650. Similarly, we believe that aircraft-service revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by continued growth in the global installed business-jet fleet.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTION An understanding of our accounting practices is important to an evaluation of our operating results. We recognize the majority of our revenues using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The following paragraphs explain how this method is applied in recognizing revenues and operating costs in our Aerospace and defense business groups.In the Aerospace group, contracts for new aircraft have two major phases: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s outfitting, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors. We record revenues on these contracts at the completion of these two phases: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the outfitted aircraft. Revenues in the Aerospace group’s other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) completions and services businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services. Changes in revenues result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries (green and outfitted), progress on aircraft completions and the level of aircraft service activity during the period.The majority of the Aerospace group’s operating costs relates to new aircraft production for firm orders and consists of labor, material and overhead costs. The costs are accumulated in production lots and recognized as operating costs at green aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. While changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs, the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered. Operating costs in the Aerospace group’s completions and services businesses are generally recognized as incurred.27For new aircraft, operating earnings and margins are a function of the prices of our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of aircraft deliveries between the higher-margin large-cabin and lower-margin mid-cabin aircraft. Additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margins include the volume, mix and profitability of completions and services work performed, the market for pre-owned aircraft and the level of general and administrative (G&A) and net research and development (R&D) costs incurred by the group.In the defense groups, revenue on long-term government contracts is recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced or services are rendered. As a result, changes in revenues are discussed generally in terms of volume, typically measured by the level of activity on individual contracts or programs. Year-over-year variances attributed to volume are due to changes in production or service levels and delivery schedules.Operating costs for the defense groups consist of labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs and are generally recognized as incurred. Variances in costs recognized from period to period primarily reflect increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts and, therefore, result largely from the same factors that drive variances in revenues. Operating earnings and margins in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume, performance or contract mix. Performance refers to changes in profitability based on revisions to estimates at completion on individual contracts. These revisions may result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract, the estimated costs to complete or both. Therefore, changes in costs incurred in the period do not necessarily impact profitability. It is only when total estimated costs at completion change that profitability may be impacted. Contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher- vs. lower-margin work. Higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) or type of work (e.g., development/production). 28CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEWYear Ended December 312010 2011 2012 Revenues Operating Earnings Revenues Operating Earnings Revenues Operating EarningsAerospace$5,299 $860 $5,998 $729 $6,912 $858Combat Systems8,878 1,275 8,827 1,283 7,992 663Marine Systems6,677 674 6,631 691 6,592 750Information Systems and Technology11,612 1,219 11,221 1,200 10,017 (1,369)Corporate— (83) — (77) — (69) $32,466 $3,945 $32,677 $3,826 $31,513 $833REVIEW OF 2011 VS. 2012Year Ended December 312011 2012 VarianceRevenues$32,677 $31,513 $(1,164) (3.6)%Operating costs and expenses28,851 30,680 1,829 6.3 %Operating earnings3,826 833 (2,993) (78.2)%Operating margins11.7% 2.6% Our revenues decreased in 2012 compared with 2011. Revenues decreased in the Information Systems and Technology’s mobile communication systems business and on several international wheeled vehicle contracts in the Combat Systems group. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenues in the Aerospace group due to increased deliveries of G650 aircraft. Operating costs increased in 2012 due to several discrete charges discussed below in conjunction with our business groups’ operating results, most significantly the $2 billion goodwill impairment recorded in the Information Systems and Technology group. As a result, operating earnings and margins decreased in 2012.

The decrease in product revenues consisted of the following:Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting $791Mobile communication products(1,177)European vehicle production(636)Ship construction(404)Other, net(230)Total decrease$(1,656)In 2012, aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues increased due to green deliveries of G650 aircraft, which began in the fourth quarter of 2011. More than offsetting this increase, mobile communication 29products revenues decreased due to protracted customer acquisition cycles and a slower than expected transition to follow-on work on several programs. Lower European vehicle production revenues were largely due to several contracts nearing completion and the revenue impact of the termination of the contract to provide Pandur vehicles to the Portuguese government. Ship construction revenues decreased due to the completion of the T-AKE combat-logistics ship program and timing of activity on the Virginia-class submarine program as the group transitions from the Block II to the Block III contract. Product operating costs were lower in 2012 compared with 2011. The change in product operating costs primarily due to volume consisted of the following:Primary changes due to volume: Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting $585 Mobile communication products (850) European vehicle production(377) Ship construction (422) (1,064)Discrete charges179Other changes, net(117)Total decrease$(1,002)Discrete charges discussed in conjunction with the Combat Systems and Information Systems and Technology business groups’ operating results include $89 related to the termination of the contract to provide Pandur vehicles to the Portuguese government, $58 of ruggedized hardware inventory write-downs for products that ceased production in 2012 and $32 for cost growth associated with the demonstration phase of the Specialist Vehicle (SV) program for the U.K. Ministry of Defence.

Revenues increased in the Aerospace group, primarily driven by initial green deliveries of the new G650 aircraft. This increase was partially offset by lower revenues in the Information Systems and Technology group’s mobile communication systems business. Operating costs also increased due to the impairment of an intangible asset in our Aerospace group. As a result, operating earnings and margins declined in 2011.Product Revenues and Operating CostsYear Ended December 312010 2011 VarianceRevenues$21,723 $21,440 $(283) (1.3)%Operating costs17,359 17,230 (129) (0.7)%Product revenues were lower in 2011 compared with 2010 due to lower revenues on mobile communication products and on several ship construction programs, most significantly on the DDG-1000 and DDG-51 destroyers and commercial product-carrier programs. These decreases were partially offset by higher aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions revenues due to initial green deliveries of the G650 aircraft. Product operating costs were lower in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to volume. However, the decrease in volume was partially offset by an impairment of an intangible asset in the completions business in our Aerospace group.

Additionally, the growing global installed base of business-jet aircraft and increased flying hours across the installed base resulted in higher aircraft services revenues. Service operating costs increased in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to volume. OTHER INFORMATIONGoodwill ImpairmentIn 2012, we recorded a $2 billion goodwill impairment in the Information Systems and Technology group discussed below in conjunction with the business group’s operating results and in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies. G&A ExpensesAs a percentage of revenues, G&A expenses were 6 percent in 2010, 6.2 percent in 2011 and 7.2 percent in 2012. The increase in 2012 is due, in part, to restructuring-related charges in our European military vehicles business discussed below in conjunction with the Combat Systems business group’s operating results. We expect G&A expenses in 2013 to be approximately 6.5 percent of revenues.Interest, NetNet interest expense was $157 in 2010, $141 in 2011 and $156 in 2012. The 2012 increase in interest expense is due to the $750 net increase in long-term debt beginning in July 2011. We expect full-year 2013 net interest expense to be approximately $90. The significant expected decrease from 2012 results from our debt refinancing completed in December 2012 that lowered the weighted-average interest rate on our outstanding debt from 3.9 percent to 2.2 percent. See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations.Other, NetIn 2012, other expense included a $123 loss on the redemption of debt associated with the refinancing discussed above. In 2011, other income consisted primarily of a $38 gain from the sale of a business in our Combat Systems group. Effective Tax RateOur effective tax rate was 30.7 percent in 2010, 31.4 percent in 2011 and 161.4 percent in 2012. The significant increase in 2012 was primarily due to the largely non-deductible goodwill impairment of $2 billion recorded in the Information Systems and Technology group and, to a lesser extent, the establishment of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in our international operations. For further discussion and a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 32 percent in 2013. Discontinued OperationsIn 2011, we recognized a $13 loss, net of taxes, in discontinued operations from the settlement of an environmental matter associated with a former operation of the company. We also increased our estimate of the continued legal costs associated with the A-12 litigation as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision that extended the timeline associated with the litigation, resulting in a $13 loss, net of taxes. See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the A-12 litigation.32REVIEW OF BUSINESS GROUPSFollowing is a discussion of the operating results and outlook for each of our business groups. For the Aerospace group, results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services, consistent with how the group is managed. For the defense groups, the discussion is based on the types of products and services each group offers with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the group’s results. Information regarding our business groups also can be found in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements. AEROSPACEReview of 2011 vs. 2012Year Ended December 312011 2012 VarianceRevenues$5,998 $6,912 $914 15.2 %Operating earnings729 858 129 17.7 %Operating margin12.2% 12.4% Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green107 121 14 13.1 %Outfitted99 94 (5) (5.1)%The Aerospace group’s revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011.

The group’s operating earnings increased in 2012. The increase consisted of the following:Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions$333Aircraft services(198)Pre-owned aircraft(1)G&A/other expenses(5)Total increase$129Earnings from the manufacture and outfitting of Gulfstream aircraft increased $136, or over 10 percent, in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to green deliveries of the G650 aircraft. Earnings from other OEM completions were up $197 in 2012 as operational performance improved. Operating earnings in 2011 were negatively impacted by $78 of losses on several completions projects and a $111 impairment of the completions business contract and program intangible asset as a result of these losses and lower revenues.33 Aircraft services earnings decreased in 2012 primarily due to a $191 impairment charge on intangible assets in Jet Aviation’s maintenance business, which has been negatively impacted by an increasingly competitive marketplace, particularly in Europe. Most significantly, certain OEMs are performing maintenance work that historically was performed by third-party service providers, including Jet Aviation. As a result of these market trends, we reviewed the long-lived assets of Jet Aviation’s maintenance business in the fourth quarter of 2012 and eliminated the remaining value of the contract and program and related technology intangible assets. We are aligning our Jet Aviation maintenance business with anticipated future demand, and as a result sold three European-based maintenance facilities in December 2012. We believe that we have right-sized Jet Aviation’s maintenance business to remain profitable, albeit smaller, in the future.Review of 2010 vs. 2011Year Ended December 312010 2011 VarianceRevenues$5,299 $5,998 $699 13.2 %Operating earnings860 729 (131) (15.2)%Operating margin16.2% 12.2% Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green99 107 8 8.1 %Outfitted89 99 10 11.2 %The Aerospace group’s revenues increased in 2011 primarily due to additional Gulfstream large-cabin green and outfitted deliveries, including initial green deliveries of the new G650 aircraft. Higher aircraft services revenues in 2011, reflecting the growing global installed base and increased flying hours of business-jet aircraft, were offset by lower completions revenues as a result of manufacturing delays and lower volume. The group’s operating earnings decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 due to the contract losses and intangible asset impairment in our completions business discussed above and from higher R&D and selling expenses. 2013 OutlookWe expect an increase of approximately 16 percent in the group’s revenues in 2013 compared with 2012, led by Gulfstream, and operating margins in the mid-15 percent range. COMBAT SYSTEMSReview of 2011 vs. 2012Year Ended December 312011 2012 VarianceRevenues$8,827 $7,992 $(835) (9.5)%Operating earnings1,283 663 (620) (48.3)%Operating margins14.5% 8.3% The Combat Systems group’s revenues decreased in 2012 compared with 2011. The decrease consisted of the following:34U.S. military vehicles$12Weapon systems and munitions(212)European military vehicles(635)Total decrease$(835)In 2012, revenues were up slightly in the group’s U.S. military vehicles business. Revenues increased due to the December 2011 acquisition of Force Protection, Inc., higher volume on several international light armored vehicle (LAV) programs and the start of the Technology Development phase of the Army’s Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program. These increases were largely offset by lower volume on the domestic Stryker, Abrams and Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicle programs. Lower volume across several U.S. armament and munitions programs, including vehicle armor, MK47 grenade launchers and Hydra rockets, due to slowed defense spending, combined with the sale of the detection systems business in the second quarter of 2011, resulted in the decrease in revenues in the weapons systems and munitions business. In the group’s European military vehicle business, revenues were down in 2012 due to lower volume on multiple wheeled vehicle contracts for various international customers that are nearing completion. In 2012, final deliveries occurred under several of these contracts, including Piranha vehicles for the Belgian Army, Duro vehicles for the Swiss government and Eagle vehicles for the German government. The Combat Systems group’s operating earnings and margins decreased in 2012. In addition to lower volume, operating results in 2012 include the negative impact of three discrete charges in our European military vehicles business:•$292 for contract disputes accruals, primarily related to the termination of the contract to provide Pandur vehicles for Portugal ($169 of this amount was recorded as a reduction of revenues); •$98 of restructuring-related charges, primarily severance, for activities associated with eliminating excess capacity and aligning our European military vehicles business for anticipated lower demand; and•$67 of out-of-period adjustments recorded in the first quarter of 2012 ($48 of this amount was recorded as a reduction of revenues).For further discussion of the status of the Portugal program and the restructuring costs, see Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact on the group’s operating margins from the charges was approximately 530 basis points. Review of 2010 vs. 2011 Year Ended December 312010 2011 VarianceRevenues$8,878 $8,827 $(51) (0.6)%Operating earnings1,275 1,283 8 0.6 %Operating margins14.4% 14.5% The Combat Systems group’s revenues were down slightly in 2011 compared with 2010 due to reduced volume in the group’s U.S. military vehicles business. Volume was down due to less refurbishment and upgrade work for the Abrams tank, fewer survivability kits for the Stryker vehicle and a decline in activity on the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle program as the system design and development neared completion. Increased volume to provide LAVs for several international customers partially offset these decreases. 35Partially offsetting the decrease in the group’s U.S. military vehicles business, revenues were higher in the group’s European military vehicles business due to increased volume on Duro and Eagle wheeled vehicles for a variety of European customers. The group’s operating earnings and margins were up slightly in 2011 due to higher profitability on several major programs in our U.S. military vehicle business.2013 OutlookWe expect the Combat Systems group’s revenues in 2013 to be down approximately 6 percent from 2012 with operating margins in the mid-13 percent range. The expected decline in revenues is due to anticipated lower services revenues in our U.S. military vehicles business and lower overall revenues in our weapons systems business. Our 2013 outlook assumes the U.S. government operates under a CR in FY 2013 and there are no significant reductions to the proposed defense budget.MARINE SYSTEMSReview of 2011 vs. 2012 Year Ended December 312011 2012 VarianceRevenues$6,631 $6,592 $(39) (0.6)%Operating earnings691 750 59 8.5 %Operating margins10.4% 11.4% Operating ResultsThe Marine Systems group’s revenues decreased in 2012 compared with 2011. The decrease consisted of the following:Ship construction$(336)Ship engineering, repair and other services297Total decrease$(39)The group’s U.S. Navy ship-construction programs include Virginia-class submarines, DDG-1000 and DDG-51 destroyers, and T-AKE combat-logistics and Mobile Landing Platform (MLP) auxiliary support ships. Decreased revenues in 2012 of $580 on the Virginia-class and the remainder of the ships in the T-AKE programs were partially offset by an increase of $244 on the MLP and DDG destroyer programs. Revenues were lower on the Virginia-class program in 2012 due to timing as the group transitions from the Block II to the Block III contract. In 2012, the group delivered the final ship under the T-AKE program, resulting in a decrease in revenues. Revenues increased in 2012 on the MLP and DDG-51 programs as two ships are now under construction on both programs.Revenues were higher on engineering and repair programs for the Navy in 2012. The increase in revenues was driven by recent acquisitions of two East Coast surface-ship repair operations and higher volume on the Ohio-class replacement engineering program.Despite the decline in revenues, the Marine Systems group’s operating earnings increased in 2012, resulting in a 100 basis-point increase in operating margin compared with 2011. Increases in the T-AKE profit rate contributed $53 of operating earnings, approximately 70 basis points of margin expansion, as the program continued to experience favorable cost performance through construction of the final ship.36Review of 2010 vs. 2011 Year Ended December 312010 2011 VarianceRevenues$6,677 $6,631 $(46) (0.7)%Operating earnings674 691 17 2.5 %Operating margin10.1% 10.4% Revenues in the Marine Systems group decreased slightly in 2011 due to lower volume on the DDG programs, the completion of a five-ship commercial product-carrier construction program in 2010 and the wind down of the T-AKE program. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume on the MLP ship construction program, the Ohio-class replacement program and surface-ship repair work. The group’s operating earnings and margins increased in 2011 due to favorable cost performance on the mature T-AKE program.2013 OutlookWe expect the Marine Systems group’s 2013 revenues to increase approximately 2 percent from 2012. With the completion of the T-AKE program, operating margins are expected to decline to the low- to mid-9 percent range in 2013. Our 2013 outlook assumes the U.S. government operates under a CR in FY 2013 and there are no significant reductions to the proposed defense budget.INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGYReview of 2011 vs. 2012Year Ended December 312011 2012 VarianceRevenues$11,221 $10,017 $(1,204) (10.7)%Operating earnings (loss)1,200 (1,369) (2,569) (214.1)%Operating margins10.7% (13.7)% Operating ResultsThe Information Systems and Technology group’s revenues decreased in 2012 compared with 2011. The decrease consisted of the following: Mobile communication systems$(1,086)Information technology (IT) solutions and mission support services(56)Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems(62)Total decrease $(1,204)The decrease in revenues in the mobile communication systems business was driven by slowed defense spending, protracted U.S. customer acquisition cycles and a slower than expected transition to follow-on work on several contracts. This resulted in lower revenues in 2012 on key programs, including the Warfighter Information Network – Tactical (WIN-T) and Common Hardware Systems (CHS), and for encryption and ruggedized hardware products. In addition, over 10 percent of the decline in the group’s revenues was due to lower volume on the U.K.-based Bowman communications system program, which has been successfully fielded and has now moved into maintenance and long-term support.In the group’s IT solutions and services business, decreased volume in 2012 due to the completion of several large-scale IT infrastructure and support programs for the intelligence community and the DoD, 37including the New Campus East, Mark Center and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center programs, was largely offset by revenues from the 2011 acquisition of Vangent, Inc. Revenues were down in 2012 compared with 2011 in the group’s ISR business primarily due to lower optical products revenues as demand was impacted negatively by pressured defense budgets and the broader economic environment. Actions taken in 2012 to align the business with anticipated future demand are expected to stabilize performance in 2013. Operating earnings and margins decreased significantly in 2012 compared with 2011. This decrease was driven by the negative impact of four discrete charges: •$2 billion goodwill impairment resulting from a decline in the estimated fair value of the group caused by topline pressure from slowed defense spending and the threat of sequestration, and margin compression due to mix shift impacting the projected cash flows of the group;•$110 of intangible asset impairments on several assets in our optical products business, most significantly the contract and program intangible asset, as a result of competitive losses and delays in the fourth quarter of 2012 indicative of lower overall demand caused by the economic downturn;•$58 write-down of substantially all of the remaining ruggedized hardware inventory, including $25 in the third quarter, based on anticipated remaining demand for products that ceased production in 2012; and•$26 for cost growth associated with the demonstration phase of the SV program (an additional $6 was recorded by the Combat Systems group’s European military vehicles business).For further discussion of the impairment charges, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Application of Critical Accounting Policies later in this section. Review of 2010 vs. 2011Year Ended December 312010 2011 VarianceRevenues$11,612 $11,221 $(391) (3.4)%Operating earnings1,219 1,200 (19) (1.6)%Operating margins10.5% 10.7% The Information Systems and Technology group’s revenues were down in 2011 compared with 2010. Revenues in the mobile communication systems business were impacted unfavorably by CRs and protracted U.S. customer acquisition cycles that slowed orders, resulting in lower revenues on ruggedized hardware products, including CHS, and other products with shorter-term delivery timeframes. Additionally, revenues on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP) were down in 2011 as the group transitioned from production to the training and support phase of the program. Lower revenues in the group’s ISR business resulted from the sale of a satellite facility in 2010 and lower optical products volume. Offsetting these decreases were increased revenues in the IT solutions and services business due to the 2011 acquisition of Vangent, Inc., and higher volume on the group’s large-scale IT infrastructure and support programs. Operating earnings decreased at a lower rate than revenues, resulting in a 20-basis-point increase in operating margins. Higher margins in our mobile communication systems business were in part due to $95 of overhead reduction initiatives, but were largely offset by growth in our lower-margin IT solutions and services business.382013 OutlookWe expect 2013 revenues in the Information Systems and Technology group to be down approximately 5 percent from 2012 with operating margins in the low-8 percent range. Our 2013 outlook assumes the U.S. government operates under a CR in FY 2013 and there are no significant reductions to the proposed defense budget. Due to its shorter-cycle businesses, the Information Systems and Technology outlook is more sensitive than our other defense groups to any additional budget reductions that may occur.CORPORATECorporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options. Corporate operating costs totaled $83 in 2010, $77 in 2011 and $69 in 2012. We expect 2013 full-year Corporate operating costs of approximately $90, an increase from 2012 due to less income from the advanced funding of our primary pension plan.BACKLOG AND ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CONTRACT VALUEOur total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $51.3 billion at the end of 2012 compared with $57.4 billion at year-end 2011. Our backlog does not include work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts or unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts, which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value. IDIQ contracts provide customers with flexibility when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries or services that will be required at the time the contract is executed. Contract options represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value. On December 31, 2012, estimated potential contract value associated with IDIQ contracts and contract options was approximately $26.9 billion, down 4 percent from $28 billion at the end of 2011. We expect to realize this value over the next several years.AEROSPACEAerospace funded backlog represents aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers. Unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The Aerospace group finished 2012 with a total backlog of $15.7 billion, down from $17.9 billion at year-end 2011. Order activity included demand for products across our portfolio, although orders were lower than in 2011 as we have experienced an elongated order cycle. Weaker order activity in the first half of 2012 improved somewhat in the second half of the year, including several North American Fortune 500 multi-aircraft orders. Customer defaults were down significantly from 2011 to the lowest level in five years. 39We balance aircraft production rates with customer demand to maximize profitability and stabilize production over time. This has enabled us to maintain an appropriate window between customer order and delivery for our G450 and G550 large-cabin aircraft, but we have accumulated approximately five years of backlog for the G650. Backlog will likely decrease over the next several years as we deliver on our G650 backlog and the time period between customer order and delivery of that aircraft normalizes. The group’s customer base is diverse across customer types and geographic regions. Approximately 60 percent of the group’s year-end backlog was composed of private companies and individual buyers. While the installed base of aircraft is predominately in North America, international customers represent nearly 60 percent of the group’s backlog. Over 55 percent of the group’s orders in 2012 were from North American customers, as Fortune 500 companies took steps in 2012 to re-capitalize their fleets. DEFENSE GROUPSThe total backlog for our defense groups represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog includes amounts that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, we have included in total backlog only firm contracts at the amounts we believe are likely to receive funding. Total backlog in our defense groups was $35.6 billion on December 31, 2012, down 10 percent from $39.5 billion at the end of 2011. The decrease occurred in our Combat Systems and Marine Systems groups as work continued on large, multi-year contracts awarded in prior periods. COMBAT SYSTEMSCombat Systems’ total backlog was $8.7 billion at the end of 2012, down from $11.4 billion at year-end 2011. The group’s backlog primarily consists of long-term production contracts.The group’s backlog on December 31, 2012, included $1.6 billion for M1 Abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs for the Army and U.S. allies around the world. In 2012, the group received awards totaling $1 billion for all Abrams-related programs, including a $395 multi-year contract to conduct development efforts for additional upgrade opportunities designed to increase the efficiency and capability of the tank. The group was also awarded $170 to continue work on a multi-year contract awarded in 2008 to upgrade M1A1 tanks to the M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP) configuration. Abrams backlog also included $225 for production of M1A1 tank kits for the Egyptian Land Forces under an Egyptian tank co-production program, $315 for Merkava Armored Personnel Carrier hulls and material 40kits for the Israeli Ministry of Defense and $160 for the production of an M1A2 variant for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.The Army’s Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program represented $1.2 billion of the group’s backlog at year end with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2014. The group received over $1.1 billion of Stryker orders in 2012, including awards for production of 62 new vehicles, the conversion of previously delivered vehicles to the double-V-hull configuration, contractor logistics support and engineering services.The group’s backlog at year end also included $195 for the Technology Development phase of the Army’s GCV program, $140 for the Buffalo mine clearance vehicle and $80 under the MRAP program, largely for upgrade kits for previously-delivered vehicles. The Combat Systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog. The backlog at the end of the year included:•$870 for the upgrade and modernization of LAV III combat vehicles for the Canadian Army, including a $135 contract modification awarded in 2012 to upgrade an additional 66 vehicles bringing the total to approximately 600 vehicles;•$800 for LAVs under several foreign military sales (FMS) contracts;•$115 for 151 Foxhound armored vehicles for the U.K. Ministry of Defence;•$150 for Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles scheduled for delivery to the Spanish Army through 2016; and•$110 for the design, integration and production of seven prototypes under the U.K.’s SV program, in addition to the integration work being performed by the Information Systems and Technology group.The Combat Systems group’s backlog at year end also included $2.4 billion in weapons systems and munitions programs. In 2012, the group received awards totaling $390 for axles in the military and commercial markets and $265 for the production of Hydra-70 rockets. The group also received awards worth $180 from the Canadian government to supply various calibers of ammunition.Combat Systems’ estimated potential contract value of $2.8 billion decreased approximately 20 percent since year-end 2011 due to the funding of IDIQ contracts and options that were then transferred to backlog, such as for the Hydra-70 rocket program.MARINE SYSTEMS The Marine Systems group’s total backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts. The group periodically receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years. As the group performs on the contracts, backlog decreases. Consistent 41with this historical pattern, the backlog has decreased to $17.1 billion at year-end 2012, compared to $18.5 billion at the end of 2011. The Virginia-class submarine program was the company’s largest program in 2012 and is the largest contract in the group’s and company’s backlog. The group’s backlog at year end included $9 billion for nine Virginia-class submarines scheduled for delivery through 2018. As the prime contractor on the Virginia-class program, we report the entire backlog and revenues associated with the program but share the construction activity and the earnings with our teaming partner. We have submitted a proposal for the next block of submarines under the program expected to be awarded near the end of 2013. In 2012, we received $385 of awards for long-lead materials for the first three boats under the next block of submarines. Navy destroyer programs represented $2.4 billion of the group’s backlog at year-end 2012. Under the Navy’s restart of the DDG-51 program, we have construction contracts for two destroyers scheduled for deliveries in 2016 and 2017. We have submitted a bid for a multi-ship construction contract that is expected to be awarded in the first half of 2013. Backlog at year end also includes three ships under the DDG-1000 program scheduled for deliveries in 2015, 2016 and 2018.The Marine Systems group’s backlog at year end included $605 for the MLP program. In 2012, the group was awarded a construction contract for the third ship in the program. Delivery of one ship per year is scheduled beginning in 2013, and the Navy’s long-term shipbuilding plan includes procurement of a fourth ship in 2014. The year-end backlog also included $335 for two liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered containerships. Construction of these ships is scheduled to begin in 2014 with deliveries in 2015 and 2016. In addition, the Marine Systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately $4.7 billion for engineering, repair, overhaul and other services. This includes $1.9 billion for design and development efforts on the Ohio-class replacement engineering program, including $1.8 billion awarded in the fourth quarter of 2012. Year-end backlog for maintenance and repair services totaled $1.4 billion.INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGYThe Information Systems and Technology group’s total backlog was $9.8 billion at the end of 2012, up from $9.6 billion at year-end 2011. The group’s backlog does not include approximately $21 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. In 2012, funding under IDIQ contracts and options contributed over $5.1 billion to the group’s backlog, over half of the group’s orders, resulting in a slight decrease in the estimated potential contract value from year-end 2011. When combined, the group’s backlog and estimated potential contract value totaled $30.8 billion.Unlike our other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and must be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards. Nonetheless, there are several significant contracts that provide a solid foundation for the business.42The group’s backlog at year-end 2012 included approximately $645 for the Army’s WIN-T program. The backlog does not include over $300 of estimated potential contract value for the WIN-T program awarded as an IDIQ contract.The Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog at year end also included $370 for the Handheld, Manpack and Small Form-Fit (HMS) program. In 2012, the group received $315 in orders from the Army for production of nearly 17,000 Rifleman and Manpack radios and accessory kits.The group’s backlog at the end of 2012 included approximately $520 for a number of support and modernization programs for the intelligence community and the DoD and Department of Homeland Security, including the St. Elizabeths campus, New Campus East and NETCENTS infrastructure programs.Programs for the U.K. Ministry of Defence comprised $495 of the group’s backlog at the end of 2012. Work continued in 2012 on the demonstration phase of the SV program. In this phase, the group manages the design, integration and production of seven prototype vehicles. Work and the backlog under the contract are shared with the Combat Systems group. The group also has successfully fielded the Bowman communications system and is now performing maintenance and long-term support and enhancement activities for the program.In addition to these programs, the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2012, including the following:•$155 from Austal USA for combat and seaframe control systems for two Littoral Combat Ships, bringing the value in backlog to $295. Options to provide these systems for six additional ships will be recognized as orders as they are exercised.•$150 from the U.S. Department of State to provide supply chain management services. The program has a maximum potential value of $1.2 billion over five years.•$125 for production and support of U.S. and U.K. Trident II submarine weapons systems. •$95 from the Army for ruggedized computing equipment under the Common Hardware Systems-4 (CHS-4) program, bringing the value in backlog to $155. The backlog does not include $3.5 billion of estimated potential contract value awarded under an IDIQ contract.•$80 for support of the Trident missile D5 life-extension program, which extends the life of existing missiles by replacing and upgrading obsolete components. •$65 for the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) program to provide support for the Army’s live, virtual and constructive training operations, bringing the value in backlog to $145.Information Systems and Technology was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2012, including the following:•An award from the Federal Aviation Administration to deliver radios that allow air traffic control personnel to communicate with aircraft. The program has a maximum potential value of $365 over 10 years.•An award from the U.S. Department of Energy to provide cybersecurity and cloud-computing support services. The program has a maximum potential value of $140 over four years. •An award from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to combine the Coordination of Benefits and the Medicare Secondary Payer systems. The program has a maximum potential value of $100 over five years. 43FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation. This focus has afforded us the financial flexibility to deploy our cash resources while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities. The $8.9 billion of cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase our common stock, pay dividends and repay maturing debt. Our net debt was $613 at year-end 2012, down by $420 from the end of 2011.Our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks and commercial paper rated A1/P1 or higher. On December 31, 2012, $1 billion of our cash was held by international operations and therefore, not immediately available to fund domestic operations unless repatriated. While we do not intend to do so, should this cash be repatriated, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax but would generate partially offsetting foreign tax credits.Year Ended December 312010 2011 2012Net cash provided by operating activities$2,986 $3,238 $2,687Net cash used by investing activities(408) (1,974) (656)Net cash used by financing activities(2,226) (1,201) (1,382)Net cash used by discontinued operations(2) (27) (2)Net increase in cash and equivalents350 36 647Cash and equivalents at beginning of year2,263 2,613 2,649Cash and equivalents at end of year2,613 2,649 3,296Marketable securities212 248 —Short- and long-term debt(3,203) (3,930) (3,909)Net debt (a)$(378) $(1,033) $(613)Debt-to-equity (b)24.1% 29.7% 34.3%Debt-to-capital (c)19.4% 22.9% 25.6%(a)Net debt is calculated as total debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities.(b)Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity.(c)Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity.We expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short- and long-term liquidity needs. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three years, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.OPERATING ACTIVITIESWe generated cash from operating activities of $3 billion in 2010, $3.2 billion in 2011 and $2.7 billion in 2012. In all three years, the primary driver of cash flows was net earnings (loss) after removing the impact of non-cash charges. Operating cash flow is also impacted by contributions to our pension plans, which have grown from $300 in 2010 to $530 in 2012, with contributions of $600 expected in 2013.Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to our expectations, the default termination ultimately is sustained and the government prevails on its recovery theories, we, along with The Boeing Company, could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.6 billion on December 31, 2012. If this were the outcome, we would owe half of the total, or approximately $1.5 billion pretax. Our after-tax cash obligation would be approximately $740. We believe we have sufficient resources, including access to capital markets, to pay such an obligation if required.44INVESTING ACTIVITIESWe used $408 in 2010, $2 billion in 2011 and $656 in 2012 for investing activities. The primary uses of cash for investing activities were acquisitions and capital expenditures. Business Acquisitions. We completed 16 acquisitions over the last three years totaling $2.3 billion. We used cash on hand to fund these acquisitions. See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of acquisition activity. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $370 in 2010, $458 in 2011 and $450 in 2012. The increase in 2011 and 2012 compared with 2010 is largely due to Gulfstream’s Savannah, Georgia, facilities expansion project announced in 2010. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $640 in 2013, or 2 percent of anticipated revenues, as work on Gulfstream’s facilities project continues. On December 31, 2012, the project was approximately 35 percent complete. Marketable Securities. To bolster liquidity in an uncertain business environment, we received cash of $219 from the net sales and maturity of marketable securities in 2012, including $211 from the sale of held-to-maturity securities. We held no marketable securities on December 31, 2012.Other, Net. Investing activities also included proceeds from the sale of a satellite facility in our Information Systems and Technology group in 2010 and the detection systems business in our Combat Systems group in 2011.FINANCING ACTIVITIESWe used $2.2 billion in 2010, $1.2 billion in 2011 and $1.4 billion in 2012 for financing activities including issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Debt Proceeds, Net. In August 2010, we repaid $700 of maturing fixed-rate notes. In 2011, we issued $1.5 billion of fixed-rate notes and used the proceeds to repay $750 of maturing fixed-rate notes. In 2012, we issued $2.4 billion of fixed-rate notes and used the proceeds to redeem, prior to maturity, an equal amount of fixed-rate notes with higher interest rates. We have no material repayments of long-term debt expected until 2015. See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including scheduled debt maturities.We ended 2012 with no commercial paper outstanding. We have $2 billion in bank credit facilities that remain available. These facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program. We also have an effective shelf registration on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Dividends. On March 7, 2012, our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share – the 15th consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $0.47 per share in March 2011 and $0.42 per share in March 2010. In advance of possible tax increases in 2013, we accelerated our first quarter 2013 dividend payment to December 2012.Share Repurchases. Our board of directors typically authorizes repurchases in 10 million-share increments. We repurchased 18.9 million shares on the open market in 2010, 20 million shares in 2011 and 9.1 million shares in 2012. As a result, we reduced our shares outstanding by over 8 percent since 2009. On December 31, 2012, approximately 10.9 million shares remained authorized by our board of directors for repurchase, approximately 3 percent of our total shares outstanding.45NON-GAAP MANAGEMENT METRICSWe emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. As described below, we use free cash flow and return on invested capital (ROIC) to measure our performance in these areas. While we believe that these metrics provide useful information, they are not operating measures under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and there are limitations associated with their use. Our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, other GAAP measures. Free Cash Flow. We define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our operations for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:Year Ended December 312008 2009 2010 2011 2012Net cash provided by operating activities$3,124 $2,855 $2,986 $3,238 $2,687Capital expenditures(490) (385) (370) (458) (450)Free cash flow from operations$2,634 $2,470 $2,616 $2,780 $2,237Cash flow as a percentage of earnings (loss) from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities126% 119% 114% 127% NM* Free cash flow from operations106% 103% 100% 109% NM** Not meaningful (NM) due to net loss in 2012.Return on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. ROIC is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 312008 2009 2010 2011 2012Earnings (loss) from continuing operations$2,478 $2,407 $2,628 $2,552 $(332)After-tax interest expense91 117 116 106 109After-tax amortization expense100 149 155 163 152Net operating profit (loss) after taxes$2,669 $2,673 $2,899 $2,821 $(71)Average debt and equity$14,390 $15,003 $16,587 $17,123 $17,203Return on invested capital18.5% 17.8% 17.5% 16.5% (0.4)%46ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATIONOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSOn December 31, 2012, other than operating leases, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTSThe following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on December 31, 2012: Payments Due by PeriodContractual ObligationsTotal Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 YearsLong-term debt (a)$4,923 $89 $673 $1,546 $2,615Capital lease obligations34 3 4 4 23Operating leases1,099 239 341 188 331Purchase obligations (b)19,841 11,440 5,385 1,659 1,357Other long-term liabilities (c)18,331 3,259 2,035 1,790 11,247 $44,228 $15,030 $8,438 $5,187 $15,573(a)Includes scheduled interest payments.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our long-term contracts and programs. Other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers’ compensation, warranty obligations, and litigation and other contingencies. We employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based on historical experience and currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented.47We believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application:Revenue Recognition. We account for revenues and earnings using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, contract revenue and profit are recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced or as services are rendered. We determine progress using either input measures (e.g., costs incurred) or output measures (e.g., contract milestones or units delivered), as appropriate to the circumstances. An input measure is used in most cases unless an output measure is identified that is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion. We estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and the total estimated costs of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the loss in the quarter it is identified.We generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion (input measure). For our contracts for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft, we record revenue at two contractual milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft (output measure). We do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of significant deposits from the customer and other factors.Accounting for long-term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenues and costs. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions that utilize the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers, program and operations managers and finance and accounting personnel to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. We include in our contract estimates additional revenues for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We include award or incentive fees in the estimated contract value when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. Estimates of award or incentive fees are based on historical award experience and anticipated performance. These estimates are based on our best judgment at the time. As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review our performance monthly and update our contract estimates at least annually and often quarterly, as well as when required by specific events or circumstances.We recognize changes in the estimated profit on contracts under the reallocation method. Under this method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term. We use this method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates on our long-term contracts affect the period in which the change is identified and future periods. These changes generally reflect our current expectations as to future performance and, therefore, the reallocation method is the method that best matches our profits to the periods in which they are earned. Most government contractors recognize the impact of a change in estimated profit immediately under the cumulative catch-up method. The impact on operating earnings in the period the change is identified is generally lower under the reallocation method as compared to the cumulative catch-up method. The net increase in our operating earnings (and on a per-share basis) from the quarterly impact of revisions in contract estimates totaled $350 48($0.60) in 2010, $356 ($0.63) in 2011 and $180 ($0.33) in 2012. Other than revisions discussed in the Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology business groups’ results of operations, no revisions on any one contract were material in 2012.Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Since 1995, we have acquired more than 65 businesses at a total cost of approximately $23 billion, including seven in 2012. We have recognized goodwill and intangible assets as a result of these acquisitions.Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. Such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process that requires a significant level of estimation and use of judgment by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations. This requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business, the appropriate risk-adjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows, and terminal value growth and earnings rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows. Due to the variables inherent in our estimate of fair value, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis. To assess the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows, we compare the sum of our reporting units’ fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units’ fair values over the market capitalization). We evaluate the reasonableness of this control premium by comparing it to control premiums for recent comparable market transactions. We also review market multiples of earnings from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating characteristics to ensure the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows. We conducted and completed the required goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2012. Step one of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. As it relates to the test, our reporting units are consistent with our business groups. Slowed defense spending, the threat of sequestration and margin compression due to mix shift have impacted operating results and tempered the projected cash flows of the Information Systems and Technology reporting unit, negatively impacting our estimate of its fair value. Step one of the impairment test concluded that the book value of our Information Systems and Technology reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. For our remaining three reporting units, the estimated fair values were at least double their respective book values. For the Information Systems and Technology reporting unit, we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step of the test requires the allocation of the reporting unit’s fair value to its assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. Based on the results of the step two analysis, we recorded a $2 billion goodwill impairment in 2012. We review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses, where identified, are determined as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows. Prior to conducting step one of our 2012 goodwill impairment test, 49we reviewed certain of our long-lived assets for recoverability and recorded intangible asset impairment losses of $191 and $110 in our Aerospace and Information Systems and Technology groups, respectively, as discussed in the business groups’ results of operations.Commitments and Contingencies. We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. We record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known.Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not allocable currently to contracts. Such costs include a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid. We have elected to defer (or inventory) these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts. We expect to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on our best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected.Retirement Plans. Our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. We determine the long-term rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forward-looking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. For the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our pension and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements.As discussed under Deferred Contract Costs, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans. We have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. Accordingly, the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our earnings either positively or negatively.50ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. See Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of these risks. The following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.Foreign Currency Risk. We had notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding of $4 billion on December 31, 2011, and $2.5 billion on December 31, 2012. A 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following incremental pretax losses:2011 2012Recognized$(57) $(61)Unrecognized(176) (71)This exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar, euro/Canadian dollar and Swiss franc/euro exchange rates. We believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding losses and gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. We believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk.Interest Rate Risk. Our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations and variable-rate commercial paper. On December 31, 2012, we had $3.9 billion par value of fixed-rate debt and no commercial paper outstanding. Our fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable, and we do not trade these securities in the market. A 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations.Our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years. On December 31, 2012, we held $3.3 billion in cash and equivalents, but held no marketable securities. 51",2023-12-30 21:00:20.454531

40533,GD,GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP,2021,"Item 7.AEROSPACEOur Aerospace segment is recognized as a leading producer of business jets and the standard bearer in aircraft repair, support and completion services. The segment consists of our Gulfstream and Jet Aviation business units. We have earned our reputation through:•superior aircraft design, quality, performance, safety and reliability;•technologically advanced flight deck and cabin systems; and•industry-leading customer support.3We believe the key to long-term value creation in the business jet industry is steady investment in new aircraft models and technologies and in customer service capabilities. As a result, since we acquired Gulfstream over 20 years ago, we have made significant investments in research and development (R&D), state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, and maintenance and support through a combination of product development efforts, capital expansion and the acquisition of Jet Aviation’s global support network.We are committed to continual investment in R&D to create new aircraft that consistently broaden customer offerings while raising the bar for safety and performance. The result is the unprecedented development of an all-new lineup of the most technologically advanced business jet aircraft in the world. These aircraft offer industry-leading cabin, cockpit and safety technologies and the longest ranges at the fastest speeds in their respective classes.The following represents Gulfstream’s current product line, along with the maximum range, maximum speed and cabin length (excluding baggage) for each aircraft: The most recent additions to the Gulfstream fleet are two new large-cabin aircraft, the G500 and G600, which entered service in 2018 and 2019, respectively. These clean-sheet (i.e., all-new) aircraft replace the G450 and G550 models, which have a combined installed base of more than 1,650 aircraft around the world. Our investment included development of a new wing, new avionics, new fuselage and new ergonomically designed larger interiors, as well as systems and technologies to improve the manufacturing process and quality of the platform. As a result, the G500 and G600 are faster, more fuel efficient and have greater cabin volume, more range and improved flight controls compared with the aircraft they are replacing. At year-end 2020, cumulative deliveries for the two new aircraft totaled almost 100.The next model to join the Gulfstream lineup is the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G700. It combines our most spacious cabin with our advanced Symmetry Flight Deck and the superior high-4speed performance of all-new engines to create best-in-class capabilities. Gulfstream is in the process of flight testing and certification of the G700, which we expect to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2022.The ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G650 and G650ER continue to generate significant customer interest, with more than 430 aircraft of this family currently operating in 50 countries. Since the first G650 entered service in 2012, its capabilities and reliability have led to significant sales and expansion of our installed base around the globe. Gulfstream’s current product line holds more than 300 city-pair speed records, more than any other business jet manufacturer, led by the G650ER, which holds the National Aeronautic Association’s polar and westbound around-the-world speed records. Our disciplined and consistent approach to new product development allows us to repeatedly introduce first-to-market capabilities that set industry standards for safety, performance, quality, speed and comfort. Product enhancement and development efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics, composites, flight-control and vision systems, acoustics, and cabin technologies.Gulfstream designs, develops and manufactures aircraft in Savannah, Georgia, including all large-cabin models. The mid-cabin G280 is assembled by a non-U.S. partner. All models are outfitted in Gulfstream’s U.S. facilities. In support of Gulfstream’s growing aircraft portfolio and customer base, we have invested in our facilities and operations.

In support of this strategy, Gulfstream and Jet Aviation offer sustainable aviation fuel through our combined services network and lead the industry in total gallons supplied to the business jet market. Furthermore, we offer carbon offset credits to our customers, enabling them to operate aircraft on a carbon-neutral basis.Revenue for the Aerospace segment was 21% of our consolidated revenue in 2020, 25% in 2019 and 23% in 2018. Revenue by major products and services was as follows:Year Ended December 31202020192018Aircraft manufacturing$6,115 $7,541 $6,262 Aircraft services and completions1,960 2,260 2,193 Total Aerospace$8,075 $9,801 $8,455 MARINE SYSTEMSOur Marine Systems segment is the leading designer and builder of nuclear-powered submarines and a leader in surface combatants and auxiliary ship design and construction for the U.S. Navy. We also provide maintenance, modernization and lifecycle support services for Navy ships and maintain the most sophisticated marine engineering expertise in the world to support future capabilities. Our ability to design, build and maintain our nation’s most technologically sophisticated warships is a critical element of the U.S. defense industrial base. In addition to Navy ships, we design and build ocean-going Jones 6Act ships for commercial customers. Marine Systems consists of three business units — Electric Boat, Bath Iron Works and NASSCO.In support of our Navy customer’s significant increase in demand for submarines and surface ships, we are making substantial investments to expand our facilities, grow and train our workforce, and support our supply chain, particularly in our submarine business. The resulting increase in capacity and capabilities will support the unprecedented growth expected in our shipbuilding business, especially submarines, for the next two decades.Electric Boat is the prime contractor and lead shipyard on all Navy nuclear-powered submarine programs. The business is responsible for all aspects of design and engineering and leads the construction of both the Virginia-class attack submarine and the Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarine.The Navy procures Virginia-class submarines in multi-boat blocks, currently at a two-per-year construction rate. We are currently working on Blocks IV and V in the program, with 18 Virginia-class submarines in our backlog scheduled for delivery through 2029. Eight of the boats in Block V include the Virginia Payload Module (VPM), an 84-foot Electric Boat-designed-and-built hull section that adds four additional payload tubes, more than tripling the strike capacity of these submarines and providing unique capabilities to support special missions.The Navy’s Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarine is a 12-boat program that the Navy considers its top priority. These submarines will provide strategic deterrent capabilities for decades, with the first boat delivering in 2027 to begin replacement of the current Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarine fleet as it reaches the end of its service life. Construction is scheduled to continue for two decades, and the value of the Navy’s program of record is in excess of $110 billion. To mitigate risk, the submarine’s design was more than 80% complete at the time we began construction of the first boat, nearly twice as mature as any other Navy submarine program at the start of construction.We are investing $1.8 billion of capital in expanded and modernized facilities at Electric Boat to support the growth in submarine construction. Our expenditures peaked in 2020, and we will have completed a majority of these investments by the end of 2021. Equal to the commitment of capital is our commitment to our workforce, which is on track to grow approximately 30% over the next decade, particularly in support of Columbia-class production. To reach our objective, we continue to invest in the training and tools necessary for our employees to be prepared to deliver these next-generation submarines to the Navy on time and on budget. We are also working with our network of more than 3,000 suppliers — mostly small businesses — to provide for concurrent production of the two submarine programs.Bath Iron Works builds the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided-missile destroyers and manages modernization and lifecycle support for the class. We have a total of 11 ships in backlog scheduled for delivery through 2027. Bath Iron Works is also the hull, mechanical and electrical (HM&E) prime contractor and lifecycle support provider for the Zumwalt-class (DDG-1000) guided-missile destroyer program. We expect to complete our work on the third and final ship of this class in 2021.NASSCO specializes in Navy auxiliary and support ships and is currently building the Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB), which serves as a forward-staging base, and the John Lewis-class (T-AO-205) fleet replenishment oiler. Work on the two ESBs in backlog will continue into 2024, while the initial ships in the T-AO-205 program have deliveries planned into 2025. NASSCO has also designed and built crude 7oil and product tankers and container and cargo ships for commercial customers, satisfying Jones Act requirements that ships carrying cargo between U.S. ports be built in U.S. shipyards.On December 31, 2020, backlog for our major ship construction programs and the scheduled final delivery date of ships currently in backlog were as follows:In addition to design and construction activities, our Marine Systems segment provides comprehensive post-delivery services to extend the service life of these and other Navy ships.

Revenue by major products and services was as follows:Year Ended December 31202020192018Military vehicles$4,687 $4,620 $4,027 Weapons systems, armament and munitions1,991 1,906 1,798 Engineering and other services545 481 416 Total Combat Systems$7,223 $7,007 $6,241 TECHNOLOGIESOur Technologies segment provides a full spectrum of services, technologies and products to an expanding market that increasingly seeks solutions combining leading-edge electronic hardware with specialized software. The segment is organized into two business units — Information Technology (GDIT) and Mission Systems. Together they serve a wide range of military, intelligence and federal civilian customers with a diverse portfolio that includes:•information technology (IT) solutions and mission-support services;•mobile communication, computers and command-and-control (C4) mission systems; and•intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) solutions.This market has experienced a series of structural shifts in recent years, and our response to those trends has further solidified our position as a market leader. Over the past decade, the Department of Defense (DoD), the intelligence community and federal civilian agencies have increasingly prioritized technology solutions as a critical element of their missions. Cloud computing capabilities, cyber security threats, and advancements in artificial intelligence have transformed technology resources from short-cycle back-office support functions to a strategic priority for this customer community. The result is a significant increase in federal IT modernization and technology investments in recent years and a shift to large-scale, end-to-end, highly engineered solutions that require critical mass and a broad array of technology services and hardware offerings to meet these customer demands. The recent Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has only accelerated these trends, which have included an expansion of remote connectivity and added urgency to required technology investments.These market shifts have resulted in significant consolidation in the industry in recognition of the scale and breadth of capabilities required to meet this growing demand. In response to these market dynamics, in 2015 we combined our C4 and ISR operations into a single Mission Systems business unit, and in 2018 we acquired CSRA, Inc. (CSRA), which doubled the size of our IT services business, brought critical capabilities and repositioned the segment as a leader in this market.During the three years following the acquisition of CSRA, GDIT and Mission Systems have undergone considerable portfolio shaping and realignment. At the top level, the two businesses share the same defense, intelligence and federal civilian customer base and increasingly go to market together to meet the ever-changing information-systems and mission-support needs of these customers. In addition, 11with the convergence of digital technologies, we are now seeing considerable commonality and significant complementary pull-through in their core offerings and solution sets, particularly in the areas of cloud computing; artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML); big data analytics; development, security and operations (DevSecOps); software-defined networks; and everything as-a-Service (XaaS). Consequently, we have reorganized these two business units into a single operating segment to reflect the evolving strategic focus and the way we are running the business.With a network of more than 90 global partners, the segment develops solutions that keep its customers at the leading edge of technology in support of their missions. The segment’s highly skilled workforce is one of its key differentiators and comprises approximately 40,000 employees, including technologists, engineers, mission experts and cleared personnel dedicated to solving the toughest security and technology challenges facing the United States and its allies.GDIT modernizes large-scale IT enterprises and deploys the latest technologies to optimize and protect customer networks, data and information.

40533,GD,GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP,2022,"Item 7.AEROSPACEOur Aerospace segment is recognized as a leading producer of business jets and the standard bearer in aircraft repair, support and completion services. The segment consists of our Gulfstream and Jet Aviation business units. We have earned our reputation through:•superior aircraft design, quality, performance, safety and reliability;•technologically advanced flight deck and cabin systems; and•industry-leading customer support.3We believe the key to long-term value creation in the business jet industry is steady investment in new aircraft models and technologies and in customer service capabilities. As a result, since we acquired Gulfstream over 20 years ago, we have made significant investments in research and development (R&D), state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, and maintenance and support through a combination of product development efforts, capital expansion and the acquisition of Jet Aviation’s global support network.We are committed to continual investment in R&D to create new aircraft that consistently broaden customer offerings while raising the bar for safety and performance. The result is the unprecedented development of an all-new lineup of the most technologically advanced business jet aircraft in the world. The Gulfstream family of aircraft offer industry-leading cabin, cockpit and safety technologies and the longest ranges at the fastest speeds in their respective classes.The following represents Gulfstream’s current product line, along with the maximum range, maximum speed, cabin length (excluding baggage), and total number of city-pair speed records held for each aircraft: The most recent additions to the in-service Gulfstream fleet are two new large-cabin aircraft, the G500 and G600, which entered service in 2018 and 2019, respectively. These clean-sheet (i.e., all-new) aircraft replace the G450 and G550 models, whose combined family has an installed base of more than 1,650 aircraft around the world. Our investment included development of a new wing, new avionics, 4new fuselage and new ergonomically designed larger interiors, as well as systems and technologies to improve the manufacturing process and quality of the platform. As a result, the G500 and G600 are faster, more fuel efficient and have greater cabin volume, more range and improved flight controls compared with the aircraft they are replacing. At year-end 2021, cumulative deliveries for these aircraft totaled almost 150.The next model to join the Gulfstream lineup is the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G700. It combines our most spacious cabin with our advanced Symmetry Flight Deck, the industry’s most technologically advanced flight deck, which we launched on our G500 and G600 aircraft, and the superior high-speed performance of all-new engines to create best-in-class capabilities. Gulfstream is in the process of flight testing and certification of the G700, which currently has over 2,200 test hours. We expect the G700 to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2022 pending certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).In October 2021, we introduced two new aircraft, the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G800 and large-cabin G400, completing a nearly two-decade effort to develop an all-new family of Gulfstream aircraft. Both aircraft combine our industry-leading high-speed range and efficiency, safety enhancements, and our advanced Symmetry Flight Deck. The G800 is Gulfstream’s longest-range aircraft, with an 8,000 nautical mile range at Mach 0.85, and it is expected to enter service in 2023 pending FAA certification. The G400 is a clean-sheet design developed in concert with the G500 and G600, thus expanding the commonality across the Gulfstream family of aircraft. Expected to enter service in 2025 pending FAA certification, the G400 will join a market segment in which Gulfstream has not participated for several decades.The ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G650 and G650ER continue to generate significant customer interest, with more than 470 aircraft of this family currently operating in 50 countries. Since the first G650 entered service in December 2012, its capabilities and reliability have led to significant sales and expansion of our installed base around the globe. Gulfstream’s current product line holds more than 270 city-pair speed records, more than any other business jet manufacturer, led by the G650ER, which holds the National Aeronautic Association’s polar and westbound around-the-world speed records. Our disciplined and consistent approach to new product development has allowed us to introduce repeatedly first-to-market capabilities that set industry standards for safety, performance, quality, speed and comfort. Product enhancement and development efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics, composites, flight-control and vision systems, acoustics, and cabin technologies.Gulfstream designs, develops and manufactures aircraft in Savannah, Georgia, including all large-cabin models.

We are also the industry leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and energy efficient engines.We are committed to continual investment in R&D to create new aircraft that consistently broaden customer offerings while raising the bar for safety and performance. The result is the unprecedented development of an all-new lineup of the most technologically advanced business jet aircraft in the world. The Gulfstream family of aircraft offer industry-leading cabin, cockpit and safety technologies and the longest ranges at the fastest speeds in their respective classes.The following represents Gulfstream’s current product line, along with the maximum range, maximum speed, cabin length (excluding baggage), and total number of city-pair speed records held for each aircraft: The most recent additions to the in-service Gulfstream fleet are two large-cabin aircraft, the G500 and G600, which entered service in 2018 and 2019, respectively. These clean-sheet (i.e., all-new) aircraft replace the G450 and G550 models, whose combined family has an installed base of more than 41,650 aircraft around the world. Our investment included development of a new wing, new avionics, new fuselage and new ergonomically designed larger interiors, as well as systems and technologies to improve the manufacturing process and quality of the platform. As a result, the G500 and G600 are faster, more fuel efficient, and have greater cabin volume, reduced emissions, more range and improved flight controls compared with the aircraft they are replacing. These aircraft hold more than 90 city-pair speed records, and at year-end 2022, cumulative deliveries for the aircraft totaled over 200.The next model to join the Gulfstream lineup is the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G700. It combines our most spacious cabin with our advanced Symmetry Flight Deck, the industry’s most technologically advanced flight deck, which we launched on our G500 and G600 aircraft, and the superior high-speed performance of all-new engines to create best-in-class capabilities. Gulfstream is in the process of flight testing and seeking U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification of the G700, which currently has logged more than 3,200 test hours. We expect the G700 to enter service following certification from the FAA in the summer of 2023.In 2021, we introduced two new aircraft, the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G800 and large-cabin G400, completing a nearly two-decade effort to develop an all-new family of Gulfstream aircraft. Both aircraft combine our industry-leading high-speed range and efficiency, safety enhancements, and our advanced Symmetry Flight Deck. The G800 is Gulfstream’s longest-range aircraft, with an 8,000 nautical mile range at Mach 0.85, and it is expected to enter service approximately six months after the G700, pending FAA certification. The G400 is a clean-sheet design developed in concert with the G500 and G600, thus expanding the commonality across the Gulfstream family of aircraft. Expected to enter service in 2025, pending FAA certification, the G400 will join a market segment in which Gulfstream has not participated for several decades.The ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G650 and G650ER continue to generate significant customer interest, with more than 500 aircraft of this family currently operating in more than 50 countries. Since the first G650 entered service in December 2012, its capabilities and reliability have led to significant sales and expansion of our installed base around the globe. Gulfstream’s current product line holds more than 325 city-pair speed records, more than any other business jet manufacturer, led by the G650ER, which holds the National Aeronautic Association’s polar and westbound around-the-world speed records. Our disciplined and consistent approach to new product development has allowed us to introduce repeatedly first-to-market capabilities that set industry standards for safety, performance, quality, speed and comfort. Product enhancement and development efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics, composites, flight-control and vision systems, acoustics, and cabin technologies.Gulfstream designs, develops and manufactures aircraft in Savannah, Georgia, including all large-cabin models. The mid-cabin G280 is assembled by a non-U.S. partner. All models are outfitted in Gulfstream’s U.S. facilities. As Gulfstream’s aircraft portfolio and customer base have grown and become increasingly global in reach over the years, we have invested in our facilities and operations around the world. At our Savannah campus, we added new purpose-built manufacturing facilities, increased aircraft service capacity, opened a customer-support distribution center and expanded our R&D capabilities.We offer comprehensive support for the more than 3,000 Gulfstream aircraft in service around the world and operate an extensive network of factory-owned service centers.

The company has two primary business markets — defense and business aviation. The majority of the company’s revenues derive from contracts with the U.S. military. The Global War on Terrorism, Operation Iraqi Freedom and homeland defense concerns have focused the U.S. government’s efforts on ensuring that U.S. armed forces are equipped and trained to prevail in small- and large-scale conflicts around the world. At the same time, the president and the Department of Defense have indicated that they are committed to transforming the military into a more agile, responsive, lethal and survivable force for future engagements. These endeavors have driven steady funding increases for the Department of Defense since 2001. For fiscal year 2004, Congress appropriated $375 billion for the Department of Defense, a 21 percent increase in funding since 2001. This amount includes $140 billion for weapons and equipment procurement and research and development activities, an increase of 36 percent since 2001. These two funding areas deliver the majority of the company’s revenues, and their sustained increases demonstrate solid administration and congressional support for the U.S. military. Congress provided additional funding for Operation Iraqi Freedom, bringing the Department of Defense’s total funding to over $440 billion for fiscal year 2004. For fiscal year 2005, the president has requested that Congress appropriate $402 billion for the Department of Defense, a 7 percent increase over 2004, including $144 billion for procurement and research and development. While Department of Defense funding levels may change over time, levels of funding available for the company’s programs are expected to remain consistent for 2004 and 2005. The global defense market is shaped largely by the demands of the U.S. military. Many foreign governments remain committed to funding weapons and equipment modernization in the pursuit of interoperability with U.S. and allied forces and flexible capabilities for peacekeeping and regional operations. The company continues to focus on the needs of these customers and expects growing international sales as it expands its market presence in Europe. General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report 15 Table of Contents The Aerospace group is one of the world’s leading designers and manufacturers of business-jet aircraft and is a leader in the long-range and ultra-long-range, large-cabin business-jet market. The company’s market is influenced in part by the capital goods sector and the demand for business-aviation products by U.S. and foreign businesses, the U.S. and other governments and high-net-worth individuals. Business aviation was affected by the global economic slowdown in recent years. During that time, the company pursued aggressive management initiatives to improve efficiency and introduced new products that expanded the markets served by its aircraft. The company anticipates an improved environment as the global economy shows signs of recovery and the business-jet aircraft market stabilizes. The company will continue to implement improved business processes to take full advantage of these conditions. The company’s management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices, disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements. The company has proven itself as an industry leader in generating strong cash flows, which have enabled it to enhance returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions and share repurchases. CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW Results of Operations The company’s net sales were $16.6 billion in 2003, up 20 percent over 2002. Acquisitions in Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems and strong organic growth in the company’s defense businesses contributed to the sales growth, offset in part by reduced sales of new aircraft in Aerospace. The overall organic growth in 2003 was 8 percent, led by 20 percent organic growth in Information Systems and Technology. Growth from acquisitions in 2003 was 12 percent. In 2002, net sales increased by 15 percent over 2001 on strong volume in Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems, as well as contributions from acquired businesses. About half of the sales growth in 2002 was organic. Net earnings grew more than 9 percent from 2002, to just over $1 billion in 2003. This increase resulted from both organic growth and acquisitions in Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems, but was offset partially by decreased earnings in Marine Systems and Aerospace. The downward pressure on 2003 earnings from Marine Systems was driven by performance problems on commercial shipbuilding contracts. Aerospace 2003 earnings were lower because of reduced sales of new aircraft and market pricing pressures, particularly in the first half of the year; however, management is cautiously optimistic that the business-aviation market has stabilized. For 2002, the company’s net earnings were essentially flat compared with 2001 because of an after-tax charge of $134, reported as discontinued operations, that was associated with the company’s exit from its undersea fiber-optic cable-laying business. The company generated significant cash flow from operating activities in 2003 through strong operating results and diligent management of working capital, including sharply reduced levels of pre-owned aircraft inventory. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in 2003 compared with $1.1 billion in 2002 and 2001. The company used its cash to pay down debt, as reflected in an increase in net debt of only $2.1 billion during the year, despite making acquisitions in excess of $3 billion. The company also used the funds to repurchase its common shares, pay dividends and fund capital expenditures. In 2002 and 2001, cash from operating activities approximated net income. General and administrative (G&A) expenses as a percentage of sales have remained consistent year over year at around 6.5 percent. G&A was $1.1 billion in 2003, $903 in 2002 and $808 in 2001. Income from non-operating items was $3 in 2003 compared with $47 in 2002, which included a $36 gain from the sale of some assets of the Space Propulsion operation within Combat Systems. In 2001, expense 16 General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report Table of Contents from non-operating items was $5. Net interest expense increased to $98 in 2003 from $45 in 2002, the result of a higher average borrowing balance from the company’s issuance of additional debt to fund acquisitions. Net interest expense was $56 in 2001. The company’s effective tax rate was 27.3 percent in 2003, 33.6 percent in 2002 and 33.8 percent in 2001. The 2003 tax rate was lower than in previous years because of a settlement of the 1996 to 1998 audit cycle with the Internal Revenue Service and the resolution of some outstanding state tax disputes. These events resulted in non-cash benefits totaling $68, favorably impacting the company’s tax rate by 5 percent. As noted above, the company exited its undersea fiber-optic cable-laying business in the fourth quarter of 2002 because of substantial overcapacity in the market and a lack of contract backlog. The results of this business’ operations are included as discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for all periods presented. The company recognized an after-tax gain of $7 in 2003 upon the favorable resolution of certain liabilities related to this business. In 2002, the company recognized an after-tax loss of $134, including an after-tax charge of $109 for ship lease obligations and the write-down of assets to net realizable value. In 2001, the cable-laying business operated at a break-even level. Operating results from this business had been included in the Information Systems and Technology group since 1998. Backlog The company’s total backlog increased 42 percent over 2002 to $41.1 billion at year-end 2003. This growth resulted from substantial new order activity in all business groups and acquisitions in Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems. New orders received during 2003 totaled $25 billion, including an $8.4 billion submarine order in the Marine Systems group. The company’s funded backlog grew 18 percent over 2002 to $25.3 billion at the end of 2003. The company’s defense businesses contributed $34.3 billion to the 2003 year-end total backlog, an increase of 57 percent over 2002. This portion of the total backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog increased to $21 billion in 2003 and includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by Congress and funded by the customer. The unfunded backlog represents firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. The backlog does not include work awarded under indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The total potential value of these contracts was approximately $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2003, up from $3 billion at the end of 2002, and may be realized over the next 10 years. The Aerospace group’s total backlog of $6.5 billion remained steady in 2003 despite adverse economic conditions in the business-jet market in late 2002 and the first half of 2003. The Aerospace funded backlog was $4.1 billion at the end of 2003 and includes orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. The unfunded backlog, which consists of options to purchase new aircraft and agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services, was $2.4 billion at year-end 2003, up slightly from 2002. The Resources group’s backlog was $220 as of year-end 2003, of which $163 was funded. REVIEW OF OPERATING SEGMENTS INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 4,978 $ 3,681 $ 1,297 35 % Operating earnings 538 436 102 23 % Operating margin 10.8 % 11.8 % The Information Systems and Technology group experienced strong net sales and operating earnings growth in 2003 from substantial organic growth and the addition of several new businesses. Volume increased in 2003 across all of the group’s operations, reflecting the growing importance of digital, network-centric C4ISR and information-sharing technologies in the defense and intelligence communities. This growth included increases in: • Sales activity in infrastructure and information technology support services; • Deliveries of ruggedized computing equipment and high-speed encryption products; • Sales to intelligence agencies; and • Volume on communications systems such as the BOWMAN program, a secure digital voice and data communications system for the United Kingdom’s armed forces. General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report 17 Table of Contents The group’s overall operating margin decreased slightly in 2003 as a result of lower margins in the businesses acquired during the year, and because earnings in 2002 included the favorable resolution of some commercial program exposures. During 2003, the company completed three acquisitions in the group — Creative Technology Incorporated in March, Veridian Corporation in August and Digital System Resources, Inc., in September. The company believes these acquisitions strengthen its product mix and service offerings and expand its customer base within the intelligence and defense agencies of the U.S. government. Also during 2003, the company combined two business units into a new business unit, General Dynamics C4 Systems. The company believes the combination of these two operations will enhance its competitive position and enable it to more efficiently serve its customers. The combined business unit provides systems-integration capabilities in the areas of tactical networks, information assurance, command and control, space products and systems, and military radios. For 2004, the company expects continued strong revenue and earnings growth in the Information Systems and Technology group, driven by the 2003 acquisitions, the group’s expanding customer base and the continued fielding of growing programs, such as BOWMAN and the Coast Guard’s Rescue 21 search-and-rescue system. The company anticipates a modest decrease in operating margins as it continues to integrate the newly acquired businesses and as new awards change the group’s contract mix. Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 Variance Net sales $ 3,681 $ 2,691 $ 990 37 % Operating earnings 436 261 175 67 % Operating margin 11.8 % 9.7 % In 2002, net sales and operating earnings were up considerably over 2001. The increases resulted from organic growth in core government programs, such as the BOWMAN program, and the acquisition of Integrated Information Systems Group (IISG) from Motorola, Inc., in September 2001. Operating margins in 2002 were significantly higher than historical averages due to a shift in the group’s product mix, including accelerated deliveries of encryption products, the acquisition of Decision Systems, the reduction of commercial program exposures discussed above, and the elimination of goodwill amortization upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Backlog The Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog increased $2.4 billion in 2003 to $7.7 billion at year end, from both acquisitions and new order activity. Over 80 percent of the group’s backlog at year end was funded. In contrast with the company’s other defense businesses, Information Systems and Technology’s backlog consists of a large number of relatively small dollar-value contracts and programs. These include programs that support the U.S. government’s military transformation, homeland security initiatives and overseas programs that underscore the growing international market for the company’s products and services. The group’s backlog does not include approximately $6.5 billion of potential contract value awarded under IDIQ contracts. A significant portion of this IDIQ value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the sole-source supplier over several years to design, develop, produce and integrate complex products and systems for the military or other government agencies. Management believes that the customers intend to fully implement these systems. However, because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer’s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders, the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. In 2003, the company received two significant awards that extend two of the group’s longest-running programs. The Army awarded the company the Common Hardware/Software III (CHS-3) contract to provide continually updated commercial and ruggedized computers, network hardware equipment, power subsystems, peripheral devices and commercial software to the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force and other federal agencies worldwide. This IDIQ contract, which has a potential value of $2 billion over its 10-year life, is a follow-on to the company’s CHS-2 contract, now entering its tenth year. In addition, the Air Force selected the company for an IDIQ contract, called Intelligence Information, Command-and-Control Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2), to support and maintain critical intelligence and command-and-control systems and networks for U.S. defense and intelligence operations worldwide. The contract, which extends a program that 18 General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report Table of Contents the company has been operating for over 25 years, has a four-year base term with two three-year options and a total potential value of $2 billion. The company won several other notable awards during the year, including contracts to develop and demonstrate several aspects of the Army’s Future Combat Systems (FCS) program. The FCS program, which is central to the Army’s transformation initiative, is a family of advanced, networked air- and ground-based systems. The Information Systems and Technology group was selected to provide the integrated computer system, sensor data management and mission planning and preparation services for FCS. The combined value of these Information Systems and Technology awards is in excess of $350 over the next five years, with potential for follow-on production activity. Combat Systems is performing additional work on the FCS program. The Army also selected the company to develop, produce and integrate the Land Warrior soldier system. This program provides the individual soldier with personal electronics, communications, global navigation and other integrated equipment designed to increase awareness, lethality and survivability. The Army plans to fully integrate this system with the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams and the FCS program. Including options, the Land Warrior program has a potential value of approximately $790 over the next seven years. The Army awarded the company a contract with a potential value of approximately $300 over 10 years to integrate a voice and data communications system, called the Secure Enroute Communications Package — Improved (SECOMP-I). This system is designed to enable joint tactical forces to arrive at their deployment destinations fully briefed on the most current intelligence reports and plan updates available. COMBAT SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 4,166 $ 2,923 $ 1,243 43 % Operating earnings 463 323 140 43 % Operating margin 11.1 % 11.1 % The Combat Systems group’s net sales and operating earnings increased significantly in 2003 primarily due to a series of acquisitions during the year that broadened the company’s product base, opened new markets and further aligned the company with Department of Defense transformational initiatives. The growth from acquisitions was augmented by steady organic growth in sales and operating earnings, including increased volume in the Leopard tank production program in Spain, growing contributions to the Army’s FCS program and strong performance in the company’s munitions and armaments operations. This growth was offset slightly by fewer Abrams main battle tank upgrades, reduced deliveries of the Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicle in Spain and the 2002 termination of the Crusader program. During 2003, the company completed three acquisitions in the group — General Motors Defense (GM Defense) in March, Intercontinental Manufacturing Company in September and Steyr Daimler Puch Spezialfahrzeug Aktiengesellschaft & Company KG (Steyr) in October. The acquisition of GM Defense included MOWAG, a combat vehicle operation based in Switzerland. With the addition of MOWAG and Steyr to the company’s existing combat vehicle presence in Spain, the company created a new business unit called General Dynamics European Land Combat Systems, based in Vienna, Austria. The company believes the consolidation of these businesses under common management positions the Combat Systems group to strengthen its market base, better serve its customers and more competitively pursue land combat systems opportunities around the world. The company believes the Combat Systems group, with its broad and diverse base of product offerings and substantial backlog, is well positioned for solid growth in 2004 and beyond. Accordingly, management expects strong revenue and earnings growth for the group in 2004 with operating margins consistent with 2003. Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 Variance Net sales $ 2,923 $ 2,210 $ 713 32 % Operating earnings 323 238 85 36 % Operating margin 11.1 % 10.8 % For 2002, organic growth was the primary driver of the significant increases in net sales and operating earnings in the Combat Systems group. This growth was fueled by increased production on the first brigade of the Stryker program, increased deliveries on the Leopard program, higher volume on various munitions programs and additional development work on the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV, formerly the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle). The acquisition of Advanced Technical Products, Inc., in June 2002 also contributed to the net sales and operating earnings growth in 2002. General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report 19 Table of Contents Backlog The Combat Systems group’s total backlog rose 71 percent in 2003 to $8.5 billion at year end because of acquisitions and new order activity, including several significant contract awards. The group’s funded backlog also grew significantly, from $4.2 billion in 2002 to $6 billion at the end of 2003. The group’s backlog consists primarily of long-term production contracts with scheduled deliveries through 2012. During 2003, Combat Systems won several contracts to partner with the U.S. military as it transforms its forces for the future. The company received an order from the Army for the third of six brigades of Stryker wheeled combat vehicles, a key component of the Army’s transformation to a lighter, more mobile force. The order, for 267 vehicles, is valued at $384 and is scheduled for delivery in 2004. The year-end backlog included $566 for the production of Stryker vehicles. Congress appropriated funding in 2004 for the fourth brigade, and the 2005 budget request includes funding for the fifth brigade. The first brigade of Stryker vehicles is deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom. With the acquisition of GM Defense, the company has consolidated its lead role on the $4 billion Stryker program, which calls for a total of 2,096 vehicles for six planned brigades. The company believes there is significant potential for international sales of these vehicles. In addition, the group and its teaming partner were selected to develop and demonstrate portions of the Army’s FCS program. The contracts awarded to the Combat Systems group in 2003 have a value of $2.2 billion and include engineering development and demonstration of a family of eight manned ground vehicles, as well as the development of the autonomous navigation systems for unmanned and manned ground vehicles. These ground vehicles are intended to be the new generation of Army combat vehicles. The Army also awarded Combat Systems the lead technology integration contract for the second phase of its Future Force Warrior (FFW) advanced technology demonstration program. The $100 award is for completion of detailed designs of the FFW network-centric soldier system, part of the Army’s plan to create a highly networked, lethal, survivable soldier of the future. The system development and demonstration phase of this program has a potential value of $1 to $3 billion over a 10-year period. The Combat Systems backlog also included approximately $380 for the continued design and development of the Marine Corps’ EFV program. Seven out of nine new infantry carrier prototypes, as well as a command-and-control prototype, have been completed as of year-end 2003. Initial production of more than 1,000 vehicles is scheduled to begin in 2006. The company received additional funding to upgrade M1A2 Abrams battle tanks to the M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP) configuration. Through this program, the company retrofits M1A2 tanks with improved electronics, command-and-control capabilities and armor enhancements that improve the tank’s effectiveness. The administration’s 2005 budget request includes funding for more M1A2 SEP upgrades. In addition, the company was awarded a contract modification in 2003 to provide 125 M1A1 hardware kits for the Egyptian tank co-production program, bringing the total program, which began in 1992, to 880 M1A1 tank kits. The Combat Systems group’s Leopard program is a long-term battle tank manufacturing contract for the Spanish army under license from a German company. The year-end backlog included $1.4 billion for the production of 232 Leopard tanks, with deliveries scheduled through 2008. The company also produces Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles for the Spanish army. The Spanish government awarded the company a contract valued at $640 for the second phase of the Pizarro program, bringing the total program value to almost $900, with deliveries of 212 vehicles scheduled through 2012. Combat Systems’ backlog at year-end 2003 included approximately $1.2 billion in armament, munitions and composite structures programs, such as reactive armor for the Bradley fighting vehicle and various trainable gun-mount systems. The ammunition programs include a $200 order from the Army in 2003 for rockets, motors and warheads for the Hydra-70 (70mm) rocket system, which raised the program value to date to over $800 and extended deliveries through 2006. The Army also awarded the company a contract to add a precision guidance system to the 70mm rocket family as part of the development of the next-generation Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS). The composite structures programs include work on numerous aerospace platforms, including the F-16, F-18, F-22, C-17, Joint Strike Fighter and unmanned aerial vehicles such as the Global Hawk and the Predator. 20 General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report Table of Contents MARINE SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 4,271 $ 3,650 $ 621 17 % Operating earnings 216 287 (71 ) (25 )% Operating margin 5.1 % 7.9 % The Marine Systems group’s net sales grew in 2003 from increases in volume across the group, including contracts for design and early-stage production on the Virginia-class submarine, conversion of Trident submarines (SSGN) and design and production of T-AKE combat logistics ships. Commercial shipbuilding, engineering and repair volume also rose during the year. These increases were offset partially by lower volume on several mature production programs, including the Seawolf-class submarine program. Operating earnings and margins for the Marine Systems group declined in 2003 because of performance problems on two commercial shipbuilding contracts. In the first quarter of the year, earnings were affected by problems first encountered in 2002 in the construction of two roll-on/roll-off cargo ships for Totem Ocean Trailer Express, Inc. (TOTE). After the first quarter, there was no further erosion in this program. The two TOTE ships under contract have been delivered to the customer. In the latter part of the year, the group experienced problems during the construction of the first ship of a contract to produce four double-hull oil tankers. Management evaluated the program’s performance and the estimates to complete the four ships and recognized losses totaling approximately $70 on the contract. The first ship was in the water in the fourth quarter of 2003 and was approximately 90 percent complete at year end. Although the company does not expect any additional charges associated with these ships, management will continue to monitor the program closely. The first two ships are scheduled to be delivered in 2004, the third in 2005 and the fourth in 2006. The company expects revenue growth in the Marine Systems group in 2004 as the group executes its substantial backlog. Based on this large backlog of steady, long-term production programs and management’s current belief that the group has turned the corner on its commercial shipbuilding problems, the company expects Marine Systems’ operating margins to improve steadily in 2004. Other significant events expected in 2004 include the May 30 expiration of a collective bargaining agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union at Bath Iron Works, which represents approximately 65 percent of its work force. Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 Variance Net sales $ 3,650 $ 3,612 $ 38 1 % Operating earnings 287 310 (23 ) (7 )% Operating margin 7.9 % 8.6 % In 2002, Marine Systems’ net sales were flat and operating earnings were down slightly from 2001. New commercial ship design work and an increase in volume on the Virginia-class submarine program were offset by lower volume on mature production programs. This shift in the group’s contract mix, along with the problems on the TOTE program discussed above, caused earnings and operating margins to decrease in 2002. Backlog The Marine Systems group’s backlog grew remarkably in 2003 as a result of several significant contract awards. At the end of 2003, the group’s backlog reached an all-time high of $18.2 billion, a 56 percent increase over 2002. The backlog consists of numerous long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as repair and engineering contracts. The Navy’s shipbuilding plan will continue to have a significant influence on Marine Systems’ backlog. In 2003, the Navy awarded the company an $8.7 billion contract for the construction of the next six Virginia-class submarines, the largest submarine order in U.S. history. The contract authorizes construction of one ship per year from 2003 through 2008. In January 2004, the five ships planned for construction from 2004 through 2008 became part of a multiyear agreement, saving the customer approximately $300 and shifting $1.5 billion from unfunded to funded backlog. In 1998, the Navy had awarded the company a contract to build the first four Virginia-class submarines of this potential 30-ship program. The Marine Systems group’s backlog at year end included $1.7 billion associated with these first four submarines, with one submarine scheduled to be delivered each year from 2004 through 2007. The lead ship in the class, the Virginia, was christened in August 2003. The company is the prime contractor on this program, and construction is shared equally with its teaming partner. General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report 21 Table of Contents The company received $310 in modifications to its contract to convert four Ohio-class Trident ballistic-missile submarines to an SSGN configuration, a multi-mission submarine optimized for tactical strike and special-operations support. These modifications are part of a $443 contract that the Navy awarded to Marine Systems in 2002 for the design and related support of this conversion program. In addition, the Navy awarded the Information Systems and Technology group over $100 in contracts in 2003 to support the SSGN conversion. In 2003, the Navy awarded the company a $953 contract modification to provide funding for the next two Arleigh Burke-class DDG destroyers, part of a seven-ship award received in September 2002. At the end of 2003, the group’s backlog included 12 DDGs scheduled for delivery through 2010. The 2005 defense budget includes two DDGs. An international team led by the Marine Systems group was one of three contractors that received contracts in 2003 to develop preliminary designs for the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). The LCS is an integrated surface combatant intended to operate in coastal areas against terrorist threats, high-speed swarm boats, mines and diesel submarines. The Navy plans to award construction contracts in 2004 to two of the three remaining competitors for two ships each. The first ship delivery is scheduled in 2007. In 2003, the Navy exercised an option to build a fourth T-AKE ship, a new class of combat logistics ships. This option is valued at approximately $290 and is part of a potential 12-ship contract awarded to the company in 2001. The backlog included $1.1 billion at year end for the construction of the first four ships, which are scheduled to be delivered between 2005 and 2007. In January 2004, the Navy exercised options worth approximately $580 for the fifth and sixth T-AKE ships. The contract has options for six more ships over the next five years, for a total potential contract value of approximately $3.7 billion. AEROSPACE Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 2,946 $ 3,289 $ (343 ) (10 )% Operating earnings 218 447 (229 ) (51 )% Operating margin 7.4 % 13.6 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 74 85 Completion 74 94 The Aerospace group’s sales and earnings were $2,946 and $218, respectively, for 2003, down from the previous year. The group’s performance was affected by a deterioration in the business aviation market during the second half of 2002 and the first half of 2003. The deterioration was driven primarily by lower demand for new aircraft and oversupply of new and pre-owned aircraft. In particular, the oversupply of relatively new pre-owned aircraft available for sale in the market put additional pricing pressure on both new and pre-owned aircraft. These conditions lowered sales and put downward pressure on margins. In response, the company took a series of actions, including cost reductions, layoffs and process improvements to reduce costs and improve profitability on an ongoing basis. The company expects to realize significant annual expense savings beginning in 2004 as a result of these actions. Market conditions appeared to improve during the second half of 2003, and the company is cautiously optimistic that the outlook for the Aerospace group is improving. The group experienced quarter-over-quarter sales and earnings growth beginning in the second quarter of 2003, and new aircraft manufacturing margins improved steadily throughout the year. Pre-owned and new aircraft inventories at year end declined considerably from 2002, and losses associated with pre-owned aircraft activity were all but eliminated by the fourth quarter, resulting in fewer losses in pre-owned aircraft for the full year 2003 ($64) than in 2002 ($81). Orders for new aircraft increased each quarter during the year and reached record levels in the fourth quarter of 2003. Market data also indicate that prices are stabilizing on both new and pre-owned aircraft. The company expects improved earnings and operating margins in the Aerospace group on slightly higher deliveries in 2004, assuming price stabilization, elimination of pre-owned losses and the realization of cost reduction actions taken in 2003. Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 Variance Net sales $ 3,289 $ 3,265 $ 24 1 % Operating earnings 447 625 (178 ) (28 )% Operating margin 13.6 % 19.1 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 85 84 Completion 94 98 Net sales in 2002 were flat compared with 2001, while operating earnings decreased from losses on pre-owned aircraft sales, charges to write down pre-owned aircraft inventory to fair market value, fewer deliveries of large aircraft and a shift in the mix of new aircraft deliveries to include lower-margin mid-size aircraft. 22 General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report Table of Contents Summary of Aircraft Statistical Information Sales contracts for new aircraft usually have two major milestones: the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft’s completion, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics. The company records revenues when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The following table summarizes key unit data for the Aerospace group’s orders and backlog: Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 New orders 75 76 71 Options exercised 3 2 2 Firm orders (a) 78 78 73 Cancellations (a) (12 ) (6 ) — Total orders (a) 66 72 73 New options (a) 3 — 4 Firm contracts in backlog 158 173 131 Options in backlog 103 103 63 Total aircraft in backlog 261 276 194 Completions in backlog (b) 38 38 49 (a) Excludes fractional activity. The company received orders for 50 aircraft and 50 options in 2001, orders for 55 aircraft and 50 options in 2002 and cancellations for seven aircraft in 2003 from fractional customers. (b) Represents aircraft that have moved from green production to the completion process as of year end. Backlog includes only the value of the completion effort on these aircraft. Backlog The Aerospace group’s backlog remained steady in 2003 despite the difficult market conditions, ending the year at $6.5 billion, of which $4.1 billion was funded. The backlog includes aircraft deliveries scheduled through 2010. Approximately $2.1 billion, or 51 percent, of the group’s funded backlog is with NetJets Inc. (NetJets), a unit of Berkshire Hathaway and the leader in the fractional aircraft market, representing firm contracts for 114 aircraft. The unfunded backlog includes $1.4 billion for 100 aircraft options from NetJets, constituting 90 percent of the options in backlog. NetJets also represents almost 70 percent of the maintenance and support services in unfunded backlog. Deliveries of aircraft to NetJets are scheduled from 2004 through 2010 and represent as little as 4 percent and as much as 17 percent of projected new aircraft sales in those years. The group’s remaining $2 billion of funded backlog at year-end 2003 consists of contracts with a broad range of customers from a variety of industries and approximately $440 of contracts with government customers. The company continues to pursue opportunities to provide special mission aircraft to military customers around the world. In 2003, the company was awarded a contract to provide four Gulfstream G550 aircraft to the Israeli Ministry of Defense. The contract has an option for two additional G550 aircraft, for a total potential value of approximately $470. In addition, the company’s Gulfstream G450 aircraft was designated the platform of choice by one of the two competitors in a pending U.S. military procurement for special mission ISR applications. General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report 23 Table of Contents RESOURCES The company’s Resources group principally consists of two businesses: a coal mining company and an aggregates company that supplies the construction industry. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 256 $ 286 $ (30 ) (10 )% Operating earnings 32 89 (57 ) (64 )% Net sales and operating earnings in the Resources group decreased in 2003 because of lower volume in the coal and aggregates businesses from unfavorable seasonal conditions and reduced earnings in the company’s commercial pension plan. In 2002, earnings increased because the company, in response to the improved long-term outlook for some of the coal operation’s contracts, reversed some contingency reserves that had been previously established. Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 Variance Net sales $ 286 $ 276 $ 10 4 % Operating earnings 89 52 37 71 % Net sales and earnings in 2002 improved over 2001 because of increased volume and improved cost performance in the aggregates business. In addition, as noted above, earnings increased as a result of the reversal of contingency reserves. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In the mid-1990s, the company embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment through strategic and tactical acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond its core platform businesses. These acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded the company’s customer base. Since 1995, the company has acquired more than 30 businesses at a total cost of approximately $13.2 billion. This has resulted in a larger, more diversified company while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility. In terms of overall capital deployment for 2003, the company consummated over $3 billion of acquisitions, repurchased approximately 4.7 million of its outstanding common shares at an average price of $64 per share and continued its trend of consecutive annual dividend increases. Meanwhile, and in spite of the $3 billion in acquisitions, net debt (total debt less cash and equivalents) increased only $2.1 billion — to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2003. At the same time, the company converted a significant portion of its commercial paper to fixed-rate debt to take advantage of attractive borrowing rates available to the company. The company ended the year with a cash balance of $860, total debt of $4 billion and a debt-to-capital ratio of 41 percent. Cash generation continues to be one of management’s key areas of focus, and 2003 was a particularly strong year in this regard. Free cash flow from operations for the year totaled $1.5 billion, compared with $861 in 2002 and $745 in 2001. Management defines free cash flow from operations as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays the company’s ability to generate cash from its core businesses for such purposes as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions and paying dividends. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with the cash flow from operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Cash flow from operating activities $ 1,723 $ 1,125 $ 1,101 Capital expenditures (224 ) (264 ) (356 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 1,499 $ 861 $ 745 As discussed above, the company uses its free cash flow from operations in a disciplined capital deployment process to invest internally, make strategic acquisitions and repurchase the company’s shares in the open market. With free cash flow from operations projected to approximate net earnings in 2004, the company expects to continue to generate funds in excess of its short- and long-term liquidity needs. Management believes 24 General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report Table of Contents that the company has adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute its financial and operating strategy. Going forward in 2004, management anticipates focusing on operations and the integration of recently acquired businesses. The following is a discussion of the company’s major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in 2003, compared with $1.1 billion in both 2002 and 2001. The increase in cash flows in 2003 was due to substantial reductions in both new and pre-owned aircraft inventories in the Aerospace group and an influx of customer advances and deposits near the end of the year. In 2002 and 2001, cash provided by operating activities approximated net income. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to the company’s expectations, the default termination is ultimately sustained, the company and The Boeing Company could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2003. In this outcome, the government contends the company’s liability would be approximately $1.2 billion pretax, or $700 after-tax. The company believes that it has sufficient resources to pay such an obligation, if required, while still retaining ample liquidity. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $3.2 billion in 2003, $400 in 2002 and $1.7 billion in 2001. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures, offset slightly by cash received from the sale of assets. Business Acquisitions. On August 11, 2003, the company completed its acquisition of Veridian Corporation, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, for approximately $1.5 billion in cash. On March 1, 2003, the company acquired GM Defense of London, Ontario, a business unit of General Motors Corporation, for approximately $1.1 billion in cash. On June 14, 2002, the company acquired the outstanding stock of Advanced Technical Products, Inc., for $214 in cash, plus the assumption of $43 in outstanding debt, which was repaid at the time of the acquisition. On September 28, 2001, the company acquired IISG from Motorola, Inc., for $825 in cash. On June 5, 2001, the company acquired substantially all of the assets of Galaxy Aerospace Company LP, for $330 in cash, after a purchase price adjustment received during the first quarter of 2002. The company may be required to make additional payments to the selling parties, up to a maximum of approximately $300 through 2006, contingent on the achievement of specific revenue targets. On January 26, 2001, the company acquired Primex Technologies, Inc., for $334 in cash plus the assumption of $204 in outstanding debt, $149 of which was repaid at the time of the acquisition. The company completed several other business acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology, Combat Systems and Aerospace groups during the last three years at a total cost of $515. The company financed these acquisitions by issuing commercial paper. The company refinanced a significant portion of this debt during 2003, as discussed in Financing Activities. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures in 2003 were $224, down approximately 15 percent from $264 in 2002. In 2002, capital expenditures decreased approximately 25 percent from the $356 spent in 2001 as a result of the completion of a facility modernization project at the company’s Bath Iron Works shipyard in 2001. The company expects capital expenditures in 2004 to remain consistent with 2003. The company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2003. Sale of Assets. On October 2, 2002, the company sold certain assets of its Space Propulsion operation for $90. The remainder of the Space Propulsion operation is included in the Combat Systems group. On February 15, 2001, the Aerospace group sold its engine overhaul business for $55. The company received approximately $60 in cash during the three-year period ended December 31, 2003, from the sale of real estate in southern California. Financing Activities In 2003, cash provided by financing activities was $2 billion as a result of the issuance of fixed-rate notes, offset in part by repayment of outstanding debt, repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends. In 2002, cash used by financing activities was $836, and cash provided was $908 in 2001. Debt Proceeds, Net. On April 3, 2003, the company filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement (the Registration Statement) with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register $3 billion of debt securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). On May 15, 2003, the company issued $2 billion of medium-term fixed-rate debt pursuant to the Registration Statement. On August 14, 2003, the company extended the debt registered to $3.1 billion and issued an additional $1.1 billion of medium-term fixed-rate debt pursuant to the Registration Statement. The proceeds were used to repay a substantial portion of the company’s outstanding commercial paper. This had the effect of fixing interest rates on debt that previously carried variable rates. General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report 25 Table of Contents The resulting net reduction in commercial paper for 2003 was $529. Net repayments of commercial paper were $451 in 2002. In 2001, the company received net proceeds from commercial paper issuances of $825, which were used primarily to fund business acquisitions. As of December 31, 2003, the company had $183 of commercial paper outstanding with an average yield of approximately 1.1 percent and an average term of 10 days. The company expects to reissue commercial paper as it matures and has the option to extend the term up to 270 days. The company has $2 billion in bank credit facilities that serve as back-up liquidity facilities to the commercial paper program. On August 27, 2001, the company issued $500 of three-year floating-rate notes due September 1, 2004. The notes are registered under the Securities Act. Interest on the notes resets quarterly at three-month LIBOR plus 0.22 percent, and is payable each March, June, September and December. The notes are redeemable in whole or in part at any time prior to their maturity at 100 percent of the principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest on the date the notes are redeemed. The company used the net proceeds of the issuance to repay a portion of the borrowings under its commercial paper program. These floating-rate notes are guaranteed by certain of the company’s 100-percent-owned subsidiaries. Approximately $750 of the company’s borrowings is scheduled to mature in 2004. Based on the level of cash the company expects to generate from operations and the existing capacity under its financing arrangements, the company believes it has sufficient resources to pay these obligations. Share Repurchases. On March 7, 2000, the company’s board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million shares of the company’s issued and outstanding common stock in the open market. In January 2003, the company repurchased 3.2 million shares for approximately $210, which completely utilized the March 2000 authorization. On February 5, 2003, the board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to 6 million additional shares. The company has since repurchased an additional 1.5 million shares for $90 in 2003. The company repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares for $100 in 2002 and 1.5 million shares for $113 in 2001 under the March 2000 authorization. Dividends. On March 3, 2004, the company’s board of directors declared an increased regular quarterly dividend of $.36 per share — the seventh consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $.32 per share in March 2003, to $.30 per share in March 2002 and to $.28 per share in March 2001. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2003, the company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases. This includes guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to the company’s stock and classified in shareholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; and variable interests in entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company or engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the company. Contractual Obligations The following table presents information about the company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003: Payment Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 5,077 $ 888 $ 775 $ 911 $ 2,503 Capital lease obligations 13 2 4 4 3 Operating leases 684 112 200 124 248 Purchase obligations (b) 4,434 1,099 1,545 1,148 642 Other long-term liabilities (c) 2,554 1,074 480 362 638 $ 12,762 $ 3,175 $ 3,004 $ 2,549 $ 4,034 (a) Includes scheduled interest payments. (b) Includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. Excludes purchase orders for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which the company has full recourse under normal contract termination clauses. In addition, as disclosed in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company expects to make approximately $74 of contributions to its retirement plans in 2004, which has been excluded from the above amount. (c) Represents other long-term liabilities on the company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, including the current portion of long-term liabilities. The projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management’s estimates, which are largely based on historical experience. 26 General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report Table of Contents Commercial Commitments The following table presents information about the company’s commercial commitments as of December 31, 2003: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period Commercial commitments Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years Letters of credit (a) $ 921 $ 786 $ 114 $ — $ 21 Trade-in options (a) 229 129 100 — — $ 1,150 $ 915 $ 214 $ — $ 21 (a) See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of letters of credit and aircraft trade-in options. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the company’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to long-term contracts and programs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other postretirement benefits, workers’ compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft inventory, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition — Government Contracts. The company accounts for sales and earnings under long-term defense contracts and programs using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The company follows the guidelines of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 81-1, “Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts,” except that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes,” rather than the cumulative catch-up method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining life of the contract, while under the cumulative catch-up method such impact would be recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified. The company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit evenly over the remaining life of the contract based on either input (e.g., costs incurred) or output (e.g., units delivered) measures, as appropriate to the circumstances. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications. These estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the timing of product deliveries. These estimates require the use of judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company’s contracts. The company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method. Business Aircraft. The company accounts for contracts for aircraft certified by the FAA in accordance with Statement of Position 81-1. These contracts usually provide for two major milestones: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft (i.e., before exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics) and its completion. The company records revenues at two points: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer. General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report 27 Table of Contents Pre-owned Aircraft Inventories. In connection with orders for new aircraft, the company routinely offers customers trade-in options. Under these options, if exercised, the company will accept trade-in aircraft at a predetermined price based on estimated fair value. Once acquired in connection with a sale of new aircraft, the company records pre-owned aircraft at the lower of trade-in value or estimated net realizable value. The company treats any excess of the trade-in price above the net realizable value as a reduction of revenue upon the recording of the new aircraft sales transaction. The company also regularly assesses the carrying value of pre-owned aircraft in inventory and adjusts the carrying value to net realizable value when appropriate. The company determines net realizable value by using both internal and external aircraft valuation information. These valuations involve estimates and assumptions about many factors, including current market conditions, future market conditions, the age and condition of the aircraft and the availability of the aircraft in the market. These estimates require the use of judgment. Gross margins on sales of pre-owned aircraft can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of aircraft sold and current market conditions. Commitments and Contingencies. The company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of its business or arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the judgment of both management and legal counsel. When it is probable that the company has incurred a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters and the company’s exposure is reasonably estimable, the company records a charge against earnings. The ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of the company’s government contracts are required to be recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of the company’s estimated workers’ compensation, other insurance-related assessments, retirement benefits and environmental expenses. These costs become allocable to contracts when they are paid. The company defers these costs in contracts in process until they are paid, at which time they are charged to contracts and recovered from the government. The company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business, including both existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. These efforts include numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. The company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under the company’s contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates require the use of judgment. If the level of backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of the company’s remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Pension Plans. The company makes assumptions about discount rates and long-term rates of return on plan assets to determine its net periodic pension cost in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions.” These estimates require the use of judgment, including consideration of both current and future market conditions. The company consults with outside experts to determine the appropriate assumptions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, future pension cost as determined under SFAS 87 could increase or decrease. If the assumed rate of return on plan assets increased or decreased by 25 basis points, the company’s net pension income associated with its commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately $3 in 2003. Likewise, had the interest rate used to discount the company’s projected pension obligation increased or decreased by 25 basis points, the net pension income associated with the commercial plans would have increased by approximately $3 or decreased by approximately $2 in 2003. The company’s contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company’s government plans. The company has deferred recognition of the cumulative earnings in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. As such, the company’s future income is not subject to the consequences of changes in the assumptions associated with these plans. Management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. New Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” in January 2003. The FASB revised FIN 46 in December 2003 to clarify certain provisions and amend the effective date. FIN 46 provides guidance on the consolidation of certain entities. The interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated if the equity interest at risk is not sufficient to permit that entity to finance its activities without support from other parties or if the equity investors lack certain specified characteristics. FIN 46 is effective December 31, 2003, for special-purpose entities created before February 1, 2003, and is effective in the first quarter of 2004 for all other variable interest entities. The company does not expect the adoption of FIN 46 to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 28 General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate and variable-rate long-term debt obligations, variable-rate commercial paper and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2003, the company had no short-term investments. Fixed-rate debt obligations issued by the company are generally not putable until maturity and are not actively traded by the company in the market. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for the company’s fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis-point increase in market rates of interest applicable to the company’s commercial paper balances and floating-rate notes would not have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2003, no interest rate swap agreements were in effect. The company also is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and certain inter-company transactions in foreign currencies. The company principally uses foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign-denominated payments, receipts and inter-company transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2003, a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company’s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized loss of $28 (pretax) and an incremental unrealized loss of $22 million (pretax). Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.

40533,GD,GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP,2005,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (For an overview of the company’s business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW General Dynamics designs, develops, manufactures and supports leading-edge technology products and services for mission-critical information systems and technologies; land and expeditionary combat systems, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and business aviation. The company’s primary customers are the U.S. military, other government organizations, the armed forces of allied nations and a diverse base of corporate and industrial buyers. It operates through four primary business groups – Information Systems and Technology, Combat Systems, Marine Systems and Aerospace – and a small Resources group. The company has two primary business markets – defense and business aviation. The majority of the company’s revenues derive from contracts with the U.S. military. Current U.S. policy is to pursue the Global War on Terrorism, encourage the spread of democratic institutions and significantly enhance homeland defense efforts. U.S. military doctrine provides that these diverse and demanding missions require U.S. armed forces that are equipped and trained to prevail quickly in small- and large-scale conflicts around the world. Current policy also dictates that success will require the transformation of U.S. forces so they are more strategically mobile, operationally lethal and tactically survivable. These endeavors have driven steady funding increases for the U.S. Department of Defense since 2001. For fiscal year 2005, the Congress appropriated $403 billion for the Department of Defense, a 30 percent increase in funding since 2001. This amount includes $148 billion for procurement and research and development (R&D) activities, an increase of 44 percent since 2001. Procurement and R&D budgets provide the majority of the company’s revenues. Their sustained increases demonstrate solid administration and congressional support. With previously approved and recently announced supplemental funding, the Congress is being asked to provide additional funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, bringing the Department of Defense’s total funding for fiscal year 2005 to over $500 billion, approximately a 60 percent increase since 2001. Over 16 percent of the supplemental 2005 spending will go toward additional procurement, as currently requested by the president. The U.S. Army will receive $9 billion of that request, and the U.S. Marine Corps will get $3 billion, assuming the Congress approves the president’s request. For fiscal year 2006, the president has requested that the Congress appropriate $420 billion for the Department of Defense, a 4 percent increase over 2005. This includes $147 billion for procurement and R&D. Overall, while Department of Defense funding levels may change over time, the company expects the levels of funding available for its programs to remain consistent for 2005 and 2006. General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report 15 The global defense market is shaped largely by the demands of the U.S. military. Many foreign governments remain committed to funding weapons and equipment modernization in the pursuit of interoperability with U.S. and allied forces and flexible capabilities for peacekeeping and regional operations. The company continues to focus on the needs of these customers and expects growing international sales. The Aerospace group is one of the world’s leading designers and manufacturers of business-jet aircraft and is a leader in the long-range and ultra-long-range, large-cabin business-jet market, as well as in the business-jet service and product support market. The group’s market is influenced in part by the capital goods sector and the demand for business-aviation products by U.S. and foreign businesses, the U.S. and other governments, and high-net-worth individuals. The business-aviation market improved considerably during 2004, with an increase in demand, a reduction in aircraft inventory – both new and pre-owned – and a firming in pricing. The increase in demand was across the Aerospace group’s customer base, reflecting the improved global economy and higher U.S. corporate earnings. The cost containment and efficiency initiatives that the company implemented in 2003 resulted in a marked increase in the group’s earnings and margins in 2004. The company expects that the business-aviation market will continue to improve and that the group will continue to benefit from that improvement and from its management and cost-reduction initiatives. General Dynamics’ management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices, disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements. The company has proven itself over the past 10 years as an industry leader in generating strong cash flows, which have enabled it to enhance returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchases. CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW Results of Operations General Dynamics’ net sales increased 17 percent in 2004 over 2003 to $19.2 billion. This growth resulted from increased volume across all of the company’s primary business groups and in part from acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems groups. The Information Systems and Technology group provided the most significant contribution to the sales growth in 2004 as a result of strong demand for its communications and information technology products and services. The company’s 2004 performance followed sales growth of 20 percent in 2003. The company’s net sales increased to $16.4 billion in 2003 from $13.7 billion in 2002. This increase was driven by acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems groups and increased volume in the company’s defense businesses, reduced in part by lower sales of new aircraft in the Aerospace group. In 2004, General Dynamics’ focus on operations and program execution resulted in substantial improvement in the company’s earnings and operating margins over 2003. Operating earnings increased 34 percent from 2003, double the rate of sales growth, to $1.9 billion in 2004. All of the company’s major business units contributed to this performance. The Aerospace group improved its earnings significantly on effectively the same volume as 2003. The Marine Systems group experienced reduced losses in its commercial shipbuilding business compared with 2003, which also contributed to higher earnings in 2004. Overall, the company’s operating margins increased to 10.1 percent in 2004 from 8.8 percent in 2003, reflecting the increased demand for the company’s products and services, the successful integration of businesses acquired in 2003 and improved processes that resulted in significant cost reductions. Operating earnings in 2003 decreased 8 percent from 2002 to $1.4 billion. The impact of increased volume across the company and acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology and Combat 16 General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report Systems groups was offset by decreased earnings in the Marine Systems and Aerospace groups. Earnings were down in those groups in 2003 due to performance problems on commercial shipbuilding contracts and reduced sales of new aircraft and market pricing pressures at Gulfstream. The company generated substantial cash flow from operating activities in 2004 and 2003, significantly exceeding net earnings in each year. In 2002, cash flow from operating activities approximated net earnings. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion in 2004 compared with $1.7 billion in 2003 and $1.1 billion in 2002. The company used its cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase its common stock, pay dividends and reduce debt. General and administrative (G&A) expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 6.2 percent in 2004 compared with 6.6 percent in 2003 and 6.5 percent in 2002. G&A was $1.2 billion in 2004, $1.1 billion in 2003 and $892 in 2002. In 2004, the company had net expense from non-operating items of $8 compared with income of $3 in 2003. In 2002, income from non-operating items was $47, which included a $36 gain from the sale of certain assets of Combat Systems’ Space Propulsion operation. Net interest expense increased to $148 in 2004 from $98 in 2003 because of a higher average borrowing balance from the company’s issuance of additional debt in 2003 used to fund acquisitions. Net interest expense was $45 in 2002. The company’s effective tax rate was 32.6 percent in 2004, 27.3 percent in 2003 and 33.7 percent in 2002. The 2003 tax rate was lower than the other years because of the settlement of the 1996 to 1998 audit cycle with the Internal Revenue Service and the resolution of some outstanding state tax disputes. These events resulted in non-cash benefits in 2003 totaling $68, favorably impacting the company’s tax rate by 5 percent. In 2004, General Dynamics reviewed its businesses to identify operations that were not core to the company and could be divested. As a result, the company completed the sale of two businesses in 2004 and entered into definitive agreements to sell two additional businesses, both of which closed in the first quarter of 2005. The company’s reported net sales for all periods presented exclude the revenues associated with these businesses. Their earnings, however, are included as discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for all periods. For additional discussion of these divestiture activities, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The company exited its undersea fiber-optic cable-laying business in the fourth quarter of 2002 because of substantial overcapacity in the market and a lack of contract backlog. The results of this business’ operations in 2002 are included as discontinued operations, net of income taxes. The company recognized an after-tax loss of $134, including an after-tax charge of $109 for ship lease obligations and the write-down of assets to net realizable value upon disposal of this business. General Dynamics’ total backlog reached its highest level ever, $42.1 billion, and the funded backlog grew 14 percent over 2003 to $28.3 billion at December 31, 2004. Each of the company’s business groups experienced significant new order activity in 2004, resulting in total new orders of $19.6 billion during the year. The total backlog for the company’s defense businesses was $35 billion at the end of 2004, up $1.1 billion over year-end 2003. The defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog grew 14 percent in 2004 to $23.4 billion. This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are also approved and funded by their governments. The unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. The backlog does not include work awarded under indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The total potential value of these contracts, which may be realized over the next 10 years, was approximately $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2004. The Aerospace group’s total backlog at December 31, 2004, was $6.8 billion, an increase of 5 percent over 2003. Perhaps more important, the Aerospace funded backlog, which is an indicator of near-term demand, increased 13 percent in 2004 to $4.6 billion. This growth reflects the increase in demand for new aircraft throughout the year that culminated in a record number of orders in the fourth quarter. The funded backlog includes orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. The unfunded backlog of $2.2 billion at year-end 2004 consists of options to purchase new aircraft and agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The Resources group’s backlog was $258 at year-end 2004, of which $200 was funded. General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report 17 REVIEW OF OPERATING SEGMENTS INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 6,781 $ 4,889 $ 1,892 39 % Operating earnings 715 536 179 33 % Operating margin 10.5 % 11.0 % The Information Systems and Technology group’s sales and earnings increased significantly in 2004 compared with 2003. The group enjoyed growing demand in all of its markets – tactical and strategic mission systems, intelligence mission systems, and network infrastructure and information technology (IT) services – including: • communication products, such as the BOWMAN program for the United Kingdom’s armed forces and the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) program for the Army; • global mission solutions, including the Intelligence Information, Command-and-Control Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2) contract for the U.S. Air Force; • surveillance and reconnaissance systems; and • network infrastructure and wireless systems. Acquisitions in 2003 and 2004 were the other major driver of the sales growth, contributing about half of the increase over 2003. The group’s 2004 operating margins were down slightly from 2003 because of a change in the mix of program deliveries through the year and lower-margin businesses acquired in the second half of 2003. Of note, the group’s overall margins improved in 2004 over the fourth quarter of 2003 as it continued to integrate these businesses. During 2004, the company completed two acquisitions in the group – Spectrum Astro, Inc., in July and TriPoint Global Communications Inc., in September. These acquisitions enhance the group’s offerings in space vehicle integration and mobile communications. The company expects the Information Systems and Technology group to experience single-digit sales growth in 2005. Operating margins should remain similar to average margins in 2004, though margins may fluctuate from period to period based on contract mix and timing of deliveries. The group will continue to focus on operations and program performance and the integration of the businesses acquired in 2004. Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 4,889 $ 3,669 $ 1,220 33 % Operating earnings 536 435 101 23 % Operating margin 11.0 % 11.9 % In 2003, the group experienced significant sales and earnings growth over 2002 as a result of increased volume in several areas of the business, including: • infrastructure and IT support services, • communications systems, • ruggedized computing equipment and • high-speed encryption products. The acquisitions of Veridian Corporation and Digital System Resources, Inc., in the third quarter of 2003 also contributed significantly to the sales and earnings growth, though the lower margins associated with these businesses reduced the group’s overall operating margins as discussed above. The Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog grew to a record $9.4 billion in 2004, an increase of 26 percent over 2003. The group’s funded backlog, representing over 75 percent of the total backlog, increased by $1.2 billion in 2004. Unlike the company’s other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog is made up primarily of a large number of mid-size contracts and programs. However, 2004 saw an unusually high number of awards for large-scale, long-term programs in the defense market for communications and IT products and services. The group received many of these significant awards during the year, leading to the substantial increase in backlog. The Army selected the Information Systems and Technology group as the prime contractor for its WIN-T program. WIN-T is the Army’s key initiative designed to transform its tactical communications network from the current 18 General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report system to support the future force. The entire WIN-T program has a potential value of $7 billion through 2018, and work is expected to be shared evenly with the company’s principal subcontractor. The group was also awarded “Cluster 5” of the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), a contract worth $295 to develop small, lightweight software-defined radios for use by all branches of the U.S.military in systems ranging from handhelds to unattended sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles. The JTRS program is designed to transform joint service operations by providing communication flexibility and adaptability to fighting forces. If all options are exercised, the contract has a potential value of over $1 billion through 2011. The group is part of a team that was selected by the U.S. Navy to build the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), a narrowband tactical satellite communications system. The Information Systems and Technology group will lead the segments of the MUOS program that supply network management, satellite control and a secure ground network, as well as a JTRS-compliant terminal solution. The subcontract is valued at over $800. The group is also a member of a team that was selected as Canada’s Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP) provider. The MHP program calls for the replacement of Canada’s aging fleet of marine helicopters with 28 state-of-the-art helicopters to be used for anti-submarine patrols, surveillance, search-and-rescue and disaster relief. The company has been selected to provide the integrated mission systems for the new helicopters and related support for 20 years under a subcontract arrangement with a potential value of up to $1.3 billion. The Information Systems and Technology group was also awarded a five-year contract valued at approximately $480 to continue its support of the U.S. Joint Forces Command’s Joint Experimentation Program and Joint Futures Lab, which develops new warfighting concepts, organizational structures and emerging technologies. The company has supported this program for the past six years, providing services such as R&D, engineering, and formulation and analysis of joint operational concepts. The Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog at the end of 2004 also includes several international programs, reflecting the demand for its products and services overseas. The group’s most significant international contract is the BOWMAN program, a secure digital voice and data communications system for the U.K. armed forces. The group’s year-end backlog includes approximately $1.9 billion for the BOWMAN program. The group’s backlog does not include approximately $6.3 billion of potential contract value awarded under IDIQ contracts. IDIQ contracts are used when the customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed. These agreements set forth the majority of the contractual terms, including prices, but are funded as delivery orders are placed. A significant portion of this IDIQ value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the sole-source supplier over several years to design, develop, produce and integrate complex products and systems for the military or other government agencies. Management believes that the customers intend to fully implement these systems. However, because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer’s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders, the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. The company was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2004, including one of four contracts under the Air Force’s Network-Centric Solutions (NETCENTS) program. Under the NETCENTS program, the company will provide information technology, networking, and voice, video and data communications products and services to support the Air Force’s global information requirements. The multiple-award IDIQ program has a three-year base period with two one-year options and a potential value of $9 billion. In addition, the Information Systems and Technology group was awarded one of 12 Information Technology Systems Support (ITSS) III contracts by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide state-of-the-art IT services and project-related hardware to DOJ organizations and other federal agencies. This multiple-award IDIQ program has a performance period of seven years and a ceiling value of approximately $1 billion. COMBAT SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 4,407 $ 4,007 $ 400 10 % Operating earnings 522 443 79 18 % Operating margin 11.8 % 11.1 % The Combat Systems group posted solid increases in net sales and operating earnings in 2004 compared with 2003. Strengthened by acquisitions completed in 2003, the group’s volume increased in 2004 as demand for its products grew both in the United States and abroad. In particular, the group’s sales of armored vehicles in Europe, including Leopard tanks, Ulan infantry fighting vehicles and Piranha combat vehicles, increased significantly in 2004. In addition, the group experienced increased activity on its contract to develop manned ground vehicles for the Army’s Future Combat Systems (FCS) program and in its munitions and armaments businesses. These gains were partially offset by lower volume on some combat vehicle production programs, including fewer M1 Abrams tank upgrades and reduced deliveries on the Stryker program due to the timing of customer requirements. Operating earnings increased at almost double the rate of the group’s sales growth in 2004. A shift in contract mix and improved performance on General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report 19 a number of the group’s programs, including FCS, Stryker and tactical air munitions contracts, contributed to the strong earnings performance. The company expects the Combat Systems group’s sales to increase significantly in 2005 based on the group’s solid backlog and opportunities for growth in the United States and internationally. Operating margins in 2005 should approximate those achieved in 2004. Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 4,007 $ 2,786 $ 1,221 44 % Operating earnings 443 309 134 43 % Operating margin 11.1 % 11.1 % In 2003, the Combat Systems group experienced substantial growth in net sales and operating earnings due largely to several acquisitions during the year. In 2003, the company acquired General Motors Defense, Intercontinental Manufacturing Company and Steyr Daimler Puch Spezialfahrzeug Aktiengesellschaft & Company KG. In addition, increased activity on the Leopard tank production program, growing contributions to the Army’s FCS program and solid performance in the company’s munitions and armaments businesses augmented the contributions of acquired businesses. This growth was reduced in part by fewer M1 Abrams main battle tank upgrades and reduced deliveries of the Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicle in Spain. The Combat Systems group’s total backlog increased in 2004 to $8.7 billion at year end. The group’s funded backlog grew by 10 percent to reach $6.4 billion at the end of 2004. The group’s backlog consists primarily of long-term production contracts with scheduled deliveries through 2012. The group’s backlog at year end includes approximately $790 for the production of Stryker wheeled combat vehicles. In 2004, Combat Systems received orders from the Army for 328 vehicles valued at approximately $440 to complete the fourth Stryker brigade. The group also was awarded three delivery orders worth $206 for 95 additional Stryker combat vehicles, including the first production of the Mobile Gun System and Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance variants. In the first quarter of 2005, the Army ordered 423 additional vehicles, valued at over $580, to equip the fifth Stryker brigade. The Stryker program, which currently calls for a total of six brigades by 2008, is a key component of the ongoing Army transformation. The Army also awarded the Combat Systems group several contracts to extend the company’s M1 Abrams main battle tank program. The first was a delivery order valued at $121 under a contract to upgrade 65 M1A2 Abrams tanks to the M1A2 System Enhancement Program (SEP) configuration. Through this program, the company retrofits M1A2 tanks with improved electronics, command-and-control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank’s effectiveness. In January 2005, the Army awarded the company a modification worth $161 to upgrade an additional 64 M1A2 Abrams tanks. During 2004, the company was also awarded a $52 delivery order for 120 M1A1 Abrams Integrated Management (AIM) material sets to be delivered by June 2006. In addition, the company was awarded a contract modification valued at $267 to provide 125 M1A1 hardware kits for the Egyptian co-production program. Another significant award for the Combat Systems group in 2004 was a $25 delivery order initiating a contract for the production of Joint Biological Point Detection Systems (JBPDS). The JBPDS is a self-powered instrument suite that rapidly detects and identifies biological warfare agents such as airborne viruses, bacteria and toxins. This contract has a potential value of $750 for approximately 1,100 systems through 2009 if all options are exercised. Internationally in 2004, the Government of Portugal conducted a competition for armored vehicles and in December selected the group’s Pandur II vehicle and funded the program. A contract valued at over $475 to produce 260 armored combat vehicles was finalized and added to the backlog in the first quarter of 2005. In addition to the 2004 contract awards discussed above, Combat Systems’ backlog at year end includes several significant ongoing programs. The group is contributing to the Army’s FCS program through the development of manned ground vehicles and the autonomous navigation system for unmanned and manned ground vehicles. The group’s backlog at the end of 2004 includes $1.8 billion for this aspect of the FCS program. The Information Systems and Technology group is also participating in this program, providing the integrated computer system, sensor data management and mission planning and preparation services. The FCS program has been restructured to deliver newly developed technologies to existing forces as soon as they are available, rather than waiting until all planned technology innovations are complete. With this acceleration of new technologies, the Army plans to focus on networking capabilities, unattended munitions, unmanned systems and manned ground vehicles. 20 General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report The Combat Systems group’s Leopard program is a long-term battle tank manufacturing contract for the Spanish army under license from a German company. The year-end backlog includes $1.2 billion for the production of 232 Leopard tanks, with deliveries scheduled through 2008. The group also produces Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles for the Spanish army. The group’s backlog at the end of 2004 includes over $850 for the production of 212 Pizarro vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2012. Another key program in the Combat Systems group is the Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) contract. In 2004, the company was awarded a contract modification to continue the system development and demonstration phase of the EFV program, which deferred the beginning of low-rate initial production from 2005 to 2006. The group’s backlog at year-end 2004 includes approximately $470 for this effort. Program production, which currently calls for over 1,000 vehicles, is scheduled to begin in 2006 and continue into 2020. The Combat Systems year-end 2004 backlog also includes over $1.2 billion in armament, munitions and composite structures programs. The ammunition programs include the production of Hydra-70 (70mm) rockets, motors and warheads. In 2004, the group received orders worth approximately $125 from the U.S.Army Aviation and Missile Command for the Hydra-70 program. These orders extended deliveries through 2006 and brought the total contract value to date to $960. Also in 2004, the U.S.Army Joint Munitions Command awarded the group $110 worth of modifications to a contract for the production of MK80 Series bomb bodies. The contract has a total potential value of $240, and deliveries are scheduled through 2005. MARINE SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 4,726 $ 4,271 $ 455 11 % Operating earnings 292 216 76 35 % Operating margin 6.2 % 5.1 % In 2004, the Marine Systems group’s net sales grew as a result of higher activity on engineering and repair contracts and several early-stage production and development programs, including the T-AKE combat-logistics ships, the conversion of Trident ballistic missile submarines to a conventional-strike configuration (SSGN) and the Virginia-class submarine program. The growth in sales was partially reduced by lower volume on commercial shipbuilding contracts and mature production programs, including the delivery of the final Seawolf-class submarine. The group’s operating earnings and margins improved significantly in 2004 compared with 2003 because of improved results on the company’s commercial shipbuilding programs in 2004 relative to 2003. The company experienced losses in the first quarter of 2003 on the construction of two roll-on/roll-off cargo ships. The two ships were delivered later in the year with no additional write- offs. Later in 2003, the group recorded losses on the first of four double-hull oil tankers. The losses totaled $70 and were the result of labor hour and material cost growth. The company’s estimates to complete the tankers remained firm through the first half of 2004. However, after the first ship was delivered in the third quarter of 2004, the company identified additional performance problems related to schedule delays and subcontractor difficulties. As a result, the company recorded additional losses on the contract of $43 in the second half of 2004. The second and third double-hull tankers are scheduled for delivery in 2005, with the fourth to be delivered in 2006. Management continues to monitor the program closely in order to mitigate the risk of further cost growth. The company expects the Marine Systems group’s sales in 2005 to approximate the group’s results in 2004 with slightly improved margins, assuming no further deterioration on the commercial tanker contract. Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 4,271 $ 3,650 $ 621 17 % Operating earnings 216 287 (71 ) (25 )% Operating margin 5.1 % 7.9 % In 2003, the Marine Systems group’s net sales increased over 2002 from increased activity on a number of design and early-stage production contracts, including the Virginia-class, SSGN and T-AKE programs, as well as growth in engineering and repair work. This growth was offset partially by lower activity on several mature ship construction programs. Earnings and margins declined in 2003 as a result of the performance issues on the two commercial shipbuilding programs discussed above. General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report 21 The Marine Systems group’s backlog at the end of 2004 was $16.8 billion, consisting of numerous long-term submarine and ship construction programs, along with repair and engineering contracts. The group’s funded backlog grew by $1.1 billion, or 13 percent, in 2004, reaching $9.9 billion at year end. This backlog provides for shipbuilding programs through 2014. While the Navy’s future shipbuilding plan fluctuates over time, the group’s current shipbuilding and submarine programs are well-funded through the next several years. The group’s most significant contract in backlog is the Virginia-class submarine construction program. The company has nine Virginia-class submarines under contract following the delivery of the lead ship in the class, the Virginia, in October 2004. At year-end 2004, the group’s backlog includes $9.1 billion for the construction of these submarines. The current Navy plan calls for one submarine to be delivered per year. The company is the prime contractor on this program, and construction is shared equally with its teaming partner. The group’s backlog at the end of 2004 includes $3.4 billion for 10 Arleigh Burke-class DDG destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2010. This includes $489 in funding awarded to the company in 2004. In January 2005, the Navy awarded the company an additional $562, which funded the final destroyer under contract in the DDG program. During 2004, the Navy exercised options worth approximately $580 for the fifth and sixth ships in the T-AKE program, a new class of combat-logistics ships. The group’s backlog includes $1.5 billion at year end for the construction of the first six ships with deliveries scheduled from 2006 through 2008. In January 2005, the Navy exercised additional options worth approximately $590 for two more ships, bringing the total contract value to $2.5 billion. The contract has options for four more ships for a total potential contract value of $3.7 billion. The group also received approximately $390 in contract modifications from the Navy in 2004 to provide design, engineering, material and logistics support for strategic and attack submarines; R&D for submarine research vehicles; and planning, scheduling and technical support for submarine maintenance activities. These awards modify a $32 contract awarded in March 2004 that has a potential value of $1.1 billion over five years if all options are exercised. In 2004, the group received $165 in modifications to its contract to convert four Trident ballistic-missile submarines to an SSGN configuration, a multi-mission submarine optimized for conventional tactical strike and special-operations support. These awards modify a contract that the Navy awarded to the Marine Systems group in 2002 and bring the total program value to over $1 billion. In January 2005, the Navy awarded the group an additional $150 contract modification to continue the conversion. The Marine Systems group leads one of two teams selected for the final stage of development for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), the Navy’s newest class of high-speed surface combatants designed to operate in coastal areas against terrorist threats, high- speed swarm boats, mines and diesel submarines. In 2004, the Navy awarded the group an option worth $79 to continue development of its proposed design for the LCS. AEROSPACE Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 3,012 $ 2,946 $ 66 2 % Operating earnings 393 218 175 80 % Operating margin 13.0 % 7.4 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 78 74 Completion 77 74 The Aerospace group’s sales increased slightly in 2004 compared with 2003. New aircraft deliveries and aircraft services activity were up while pre-owned aircraft sales were lower. The group’s earnings and margins in 2004 grew considerably over 2003. This increase resulted from three factors: • substantial cost reductions, • positive earnings on pre-owned aircraft sales versus losses in 2003 and • a combination of additional new aircraft deliveries and a more favorable mix of deliveries. In 2003, the company initiated a series of cost-containment efforts and process improvements in response to declining market conditions and an oversupply of aircraft in the business-jet market. These steps removed significant costs from the group’s new aircraft manufacturing process. In addition, the company implemented a more disciplined approach to pre-owned aircraft activity. As a result, sales of pre-owned aircraft in 2004 resulted in earnings of $6 compared with losses of $64 in 2003. These factors, combined with the increased volume and improved mix of aircraft deliveries, resulted in the significant rise in earnings and margins for the group in 2004. Business-jet market conditions improved significantly in 2004. Demand for new aircraft increased steadily throughout the year, and there was a marked improvement in pricing in the order activity late in the year. The group finished 2004 with a record number of orders in the fourth quarter and for the full year, excluding orders from fractional fleet customers. With the 2005 production schedule substantially sold out, the company expects moderate sales growth in the Aerospace group in 2005 with improving operating margins. 22 General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 2,946 $ 3,289 $ (343 ) (10 )% Operating earnings 218 447 (229 ) (51 )% Operating margin 7.4 % 13.6 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 74 85 Completion 74 94 Net sales and operating earnings decreased in 2003 compared with 2002 because of deterioration in the business-jet market during the second half of 2002 and the first half of 2003. Lower demand for new aircraft and oversupply of new and pre-owned aircraft for sale in the market resulted in downward pricing pressures. These factors lowered the group’s sales and caused earnings and margins to decline in 2003. Summary of Aircraft Statistical Information Sales contracts for new aircraft usually have two major milestones: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s completion, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics. The company records revenues when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The following table summarizes key unit data for the Aerospace group’s orders and backlog: Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 New orders 96 75 76 Options exercised 1 3 2 Firm orders (a) 97 78 78 Cancellations (a) (2 ) (12 ) (6 ) Total orders 95 66 72 New options (a) — 3 — Firm contracts in backlog 175 158 173 Options in backlog 100 103 103 Total aircraft in backlog 275 261 276 Completions in backlog (b) 39 38 38 (a) Excludes fractional activity, because these orders are made under master agreements that the customer draws down over several years. The company received orders for 55 aircraft and 50 options in 2002 and cancellations for seven aircraft in 2003 from fractional fleet customers. (b) Represents aircraft that have moved from green production to the completion process as of year end. Backlog includes only the value of the completion effort on these aircraft. The Aerospace group’s backlog reached $6.8 billion at year-end 2004. Approximately 70 percent of the group’s backlog, or $4.6 billion, was funded at year end. In 2004, the group received the largest number of new aircraft orders in the company’s history, excluding orders from fractional fleet customers. The backlog includes aircraft deliveries scheduled through 2011. A significant portion of the group’s backlog is with NetJets Inc. (NetJets), a unit of Berkshire Hathaway and the leader in the fractional aircraft market. The group’s funded backlog at year end includes $1.9 billion with NetJets, representing firm contracts for 107 aircraft, including 12 green aircraft that are scheduled for delivery in 2005. The unfunded backlog includes $1.4 billion for 100 aircraft options from NetJets, constituting all of the options in backlog. NetJets also represents 70 percent of the maintenance and support services in unfunded backlog. Deliveries of aircraft to NetJets are scheduled from 2005 through 2011 and represent as little as 4 percent and as much as 12 percent of projected new aircraft sales in those years. General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report 23 The group’s remaining $2.7 billion of funded backlog at year-end 2004 consists of contracts with a broad range of customers from a variety of industries and includes approximately $400 of contracts with government customers. RESOURCES The company’s Resources group principally consists of two businesses: a coal mining company and an aggregates company that supplies the construction industry. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 252 $ 256 $ (4 ) (2 )% Operating earnings 19 32 (13 ) (41 )% Net sales in 2004 were down compared with 2003 as a result of decreased volume in the coal business offset in part by a slight increase in activity in the aggregates business. The group’s 2004 operating earnings were lower than 2003 because the earnings in 2003 were favorably impacted by the reduction of surface reclamation obligations in the company’s coal mining operations. Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 256 $ 286 $ (30 ) (10 )% Operating earnings 32 89 (57 ) (64 )% Net sales in 2003 decreased versus 2002 because of lower volume in the coal and aggregates businesses from unfavorable seasonal conditions. The 2003 operating earnings were down from 2002 due to the volume decline and reduced earnings in the company’s commercial pension plan. In addition, the 2002 earnings were favorably impacted by the resolution of contingency reserves that had previously been established, due to an improved long-term outlook for some of the coal operation’s contracts. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In the mid-1990s, General Dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment, focusing on strong cash flow generation to enable a series of strategic and tactical acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond its core platform businesses. These acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded the company’s customer base. Since 1995, the company has acquired 37 businesses at a total cost of over $13.5 billion. This has resulted in a larger, more diversified company while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility. In 2004, the company continued its strong performance of cash generation, with net cash provided by operating activities far surpassing net earnings for the second year in a row. The company employed this cash to complete three niche acquisitions, continue its trend of annual dividend increases and pay down debt to further enhance an already strong balance sheet. The company ended 2004 with a cash balance of $976, total debt of $3.3 billion and a debt-to-capital ratio of 31.4 percent. Free cash flow from operations totaled $1.5 billion for both 2004 and 2003, compared with $860 in 2002. Management defines free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays the company’s ability to generate cash from its core businesses for such purposes as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions and paying dividends. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,802 $ 1,723 $ 1,122 Capital expenditures (266 ) (222 ) (262 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 1,536 $ 1,501 $ 860 Cash flows as a percentage of net earnings: Net cash provided by operating activities 147 % 172 % 122 % Free cash flow from operations 125 % 150 % 94 % As discussed above, the company uses its free cash flow from operations in a disciplined capital deployment process to invest internally, make acquisitions, pay dividends and repurchase the company’s shares in the open market. With free cash flow from operations projected to approximate net earnings in 2005, the company expects to continue to generate funds in excess of its short- and long-term liquidity needs. Management believes that the company has adequate funds on 24 General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute its financial and operating strategy. The following is a discussion of the company’s major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Operating Activities The company generated strong cash flow from operating activities in 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion in 2004, $1.7 billion in 2003 and $1.1 billion in 2002. In each year, net earnings was the primary driver of the company’s cash flow. In 2004, cash from operating activities exceeded net earnings primarily due to taxes paid being lower than the tax provision. In 2003, the increase in cash flow was attributable to substantial reductions in both new and pre-owned aircraft inventory in the Aerospace group and an influx of customer advances near the end of the year. In 2002, cash provided by operating activities approximated net earnings. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to the company’s expectations, the default termination is ultimately sustained, the company and The Boeing Company could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2004. In this outcome, the government contends the company’s liability would be approximately $1.2 billion pretax, or $700 after-tax. The company believes that it has sufficient resources to pay such an obligation, if required, while still retaining ample liquidity. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $783 in 2004, compared with $3.2 billion in 2003 and $398 in 2002. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures. Business Acquisitions. In 2004, the company completed three acquisitions at a total cost of approximately $500. On July 9, the company acquired Spectrum Astro, Inc., of Gilbert, Arizona. On September 17, the company acquired TriPoint Global Communications Inc., based in Newton, North Carolina. On November 1, the company acquired Engineering Technology Inc., of Orlando, Florida. On August 11, 2003, the company completed its acquisition of Veridian Corporation, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, for approximately $1.5 billion in cash. On March 1, 2003, the company acquired GM Defense of London, Ontario, a business unit of General Motors Corporation, for approximately $1.1 billion in cash. On June 14, 2002, the company acquired the outstanding stock of Advanced Technical Products, Inc., for $214 in cash, plus the assumption of $43 in outstanding debt, which was repaid at the time of the acquisition. The company completed several other business acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology, Combat Systems and Aerospace groups during 2003 and 2002 at a total cost of approximately $550. The company financed these acquisitions by issuing commercial paper. The company refinanced a substantial portion of its commercial paper during 2003, as discussed in Financing Activities. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $266 in 2004, $222 in 2003 and $262 in 2002. The company expects capital expenditures of approximately $350 in 2005. The anticipated increase over 2004 results from planned repairs to a damaged graving dock at Electric Boat and facilities improvements at Gulfstream. The company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2004. Sale of Assets. In 2004, the company sold two small, non-core businesses. The company also signed definitive agreements to sell two additional businesses. These transactions closed in early 2005. In 2002, the company sold certain assets of its Space Propulsion operation. The remainder of the Space Propulsion operation is included in the Combat Systems group. The company received approximately $50 in cash during the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, from the sale of real estate in southern California. Financing Activities In 2004, cash used by financing activities was $904, versus $2 billion of cash generated in 2003 and $836 of cash used in 2002. The company’s typical financing activities are issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Debt Proceeds, Net. In 2004, the company repaid $500 of floating-rate notes that matured in September. In 2003, the company issued $3.1 billion of medium-term fixed-rate debt securities under a Form S-3 Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The proceeds of this debt were used to repay a substantial portion of the company’s commercial paper in 2003, which had the effect of fixing interest rates on debt that previously carried variable rates. Net repayments of commercial paper were $182 in 2004, $529 in 2003 and $451 in 2002. As of December 31, 2004, the company had no commercial paper outstanding. The company has $2 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon and are used to provide backup liquidity to the commercial paper program. The company does not have any material debt that is scheduled to mature in 2005. General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report 25 Dividends. On March 2, 2005, the company’s board of directors declared an increased regular quarterly dividend of $.40 per share – the eighth consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $.36 per share in March 2004, to $.32 per share in March 2003 and to $.30 per share in March 2002. Share Repurchases. During 2004, the company did not repurchase any shares of its issued and outstanding common stock in the open market. In 2003, the company repurchased 4.7 million shares at an average price of $64 per share, for a total value of approximately $300. In 2002, the company repurchased 1.3 million shares for $100. As of December 31, 2004, the company had approximately 4.5 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. During the first month of 2005, the company repurchased 1 million shares for approximately $100. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2004, the company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases. This includes guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to the company’s stock and classified in shareholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; and variable interests in entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company or engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the company. Contractual Obligations The following table presents information about the company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 4,197 $ 144 $ 764 $ 882 $ 2,407 Capital lease obligations 10 2 4 3 1 Operating leases 581 122 183 109 167 Purchase obligations (b) 5,240 1,508 1,774 977 981 Other long-term liabilities (c) 3,042 1,132 513 293 1,104 $ 13,070 $ 2,908 $ 3,238 $ 2,264 $ 4,660 (a) Includes scheduled interest payments. (b) Includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. Excludes purchase orders for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which the company has full recourse under normal contract termination clauses. In addition, as disclosed in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company expects to make approximately $46 of contributions to its retirement plans in 2005, which has been excluded from the above amount. (c) Represents other long-term liabilities on the company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, including the current portion of long-term liabilities. The projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management’s estimates, which are largely based on historical experience.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to long-term contracts and programs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers’ compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft inventory, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition – Government Contracts. The company accounts for sales and earnings under long-term defense contracts and programs using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The company follows the guidelines of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts, except that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, rather than the cumulative catch-up method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining life of the contract, while under the cumulative catch-up method such impact would be recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified. Anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts, including G&A expenses. The company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit evenly over the remaining life of the contract based on either input (e.g., costs incurred) or output (e.g., units delivered) measures, as appropriate to the circumstances. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications. These estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the timing of product deliveries. These estimates are based on the company’s best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company’s contracts. The company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method. Business Aircraft. The company accounts for contracts for aircraft certified by the FAA in accordance with Statement of Position 81-1. These contracts usually provide for two major milestones: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft (i.e., before exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics) and its completion. The company records revenue at two points: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer. Pre-owned Aircraft Inventories. In connection with orders for new aircraft, the company routinely offers customers trade-in options. Under these options, if exercised, the company will accept trade-in aircraft at a predetermined price based on estimated fair value. It is the company’s policy to limit its investment in pre-owned aircraft inventory at any point in time to $200, unless specifically authorized. Once acquired in connection with a sale of new aircraft, the company records pre-owned aircraft at the lower of trade-in value or estimated net realizable value. The company treats any excess of the trade-in price above the net realizable value as a reduction of revenue upon the recording of the new aircraft sales transaction. The company also regularly assesses the carrying value of pre-owned aircraft in inventory and adjusts the carrying value to net realizable value when appropriate. The company determines net realizable value by using both internal and external aircraft valuation information. These valuations involve estimates and assumptions about many factors, including current market conditions, future market conditions, the age and condition of the aircraft and the availability of the aircraft in the market. These estimates are based on the company’s best judgment. Gross margins on sales of pre-owned aircraft can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of aircraft sold and current market conditions. General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report 27 Commitments and Contingencies. The company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of its business or arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. The company records a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when the company’s exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of the company’s government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of the company’s estimated workers’ compensation, other insurance-related assessments, retirement benefits and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts when they are paid. In accordance with AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Federal Government Contractors, the company defers these costs in contracts in process until they are paid, at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government. The company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business, including both existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. This business base includes numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. The company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under the company’s contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on the company’s best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of the company’s remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Pension Plans. The company makes assumptions about discount rates and long-term rates of return on plan assets to determine its net periodic pension cost in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions. These estimates are based on the company’s best judgment, including consideration of both current and future market conditions. The company considers both internal and external evidence to determine the appropriate assumptions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, future pension cost as determined under SFAS 87 could increase or decrease. If the assumed rate of return on plan assets increased or decreased by 25 basis points, the company’s net pension income associated with its commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately $3 in 2004. Likewise, had the interest rate used to discount the company’s projected pension obligation increased or decreased by 25 basis points, the net pension income associated with the commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately $1 in 2004. The company’s contractual arrangements with the U.S.government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company’s government plans. In accordance with AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Federal Government Contractors, the company has deferred recognition of the cumulative earnings in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. As such, the company’s future income is not subject to the consequences of changes in the assumptions associated with these plans. Management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. New Accounting Standards In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123(R)). SFAS 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value. SFAS 123(R) is effective in the third quarter of 2005. The company expects the adoption of SFAS 123(R) to reduce its net earnings by approximately $15 in 2005. 28 General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations, variable-rate commercial paper and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2004, the company had no short-term investments. Fixed-rate debt obligations issued by the company are generally not putable and are not actively traded by the company in the market. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for the company’s fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis-point increase in market interest rates applicable to the company’s commercial paper balances would not have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2004, no interest rate swap agreements were in effect. The company also is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers, long-term debt and certain inter-company transactions in foreign currencies. The company principally uses foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign-denominated payments, receipts and inter-company transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2004, a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company’s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized loss of $14 (pretax) and an incremental unrealized loss of $56 (pretax). Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report 29",2023-12-30 21:00:02.366850
40533,GD,GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP,2006,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (For an overview of the company’s business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW General Dynamics is a market leader in mission-critical information systems and technologies; land and expeditionary combat systems, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and business aviation. The company is comprised of four primary business groups — Information Systems and Technology, Combat Systems, Marine Systems and Aerospace — and a smaller Resources group. General Dynamics’ primary customers are the U.S. military, other government organizations, the armed forces of allied nations, and a diverse base of corporate and individual buyers of business aircraft.The company operates in two primary markets — defense and business aviation. The majority of the company’s revenues derive from contracts with the U.S. military. The current Administration’s desire to modernize U.S. military forces coupled with the U.S. military’s engagement in the Global War on Terrorism has driven steady Department of Defense funding increases since 2001. For fiscal year 2006, the Congress appropriated $411 billion for the Department of Defense, a 33 percent increase in funding since 2001. This amount includes $147 billion for procurement and research and development (R&D) activities, an increase of 43 percent since 2001. Procurement and R&D budgets, also known as investment accounts, provide the majority of the company’s revenues and, over the past several years, these budget lines have enjoyed sustained increases that demonstrate continued administration and congressional support. For fiscal year 2007, the President has requested that the Congress appropriate $439 billion for the Department of Defense, a 7 percent increase over the 2006 funding. This includes $157 billion for procurement and R&D, an increase of 7 percent over 2006 investment funds. In addition, the President’s 2007-2011 future year defense program (FYDP) anticipates investment funding growing at a nearly 5 percent compound annual growth rate, led by 9 percent compound annual procurement growth. During this wartime era, defense budgets have evolved to include not only the President’s initial budget submission, but also supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year. For fiscal year 2006, the Congress has been asked to provide at least $118 billion in supplemental funding, which, if approved, will bring total defense funding for fiscal year 2006 to over $525 billion, an approximately 65 percent increase since 2001. Approximately 20 percent, or $25 billion, of the 2006 supplemental funding request is anticipated for additional investment funding. Looking ahead, the defense budget top line is expected to continue to grow, albeit at a somewhat more moderate rate. Supplemental funding to support ongoing conflicts, in part, is linked to levels of deployed troops and conflict intensity and will likely decrease with a reduction of hostilities. While this introduces some variability into the overall level of future defense spending, based on the recently approved and proposed defense budgets, the company expects the levels of funding available for its programs will likely continue to grow in 2006 and 2007. The importance of many of the companies programs to the future of the U.S. military was highlighted in the 2005 Department of Defense Quadrennial Defense Review. This strategic document emphasized some core departmental missions, including pursuing the Global War on Terrorism, enhancing homeland defense efforts and encouraging the spread of democratic institutions worldwide. The review highlighted many strategic priorities that are supported by General Dynamics’ products and services, including increasing special operations forces, improving intelligence-gathering capabilities, accelerating the production of littoral combat ships and increasing submarine procurement. Defense Funding 2001–2007 General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report 19 Table of Contents Internationally, many foreign governments remain committed to funding weapons and equipment modernization in the pursuit of interoperability with U.S. and allied forces and flexible capabilities for peacekeeping and regional operations. The company is committed to pursuing international opportunities presented by increased foreign demand for military hardware and information technologies. While revenue opportunities are significant, European and other foreign defense budgets are subject to the same unpredictable issues of contract award timing, defense priorities and overall fiscal spending pressures that exist in the United States. The company continues to focus on the needs of these customers and expects growing international sales, particularly in the Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems businesses. In the business-aviation market, the Aerospace group is one of the world’s leading designers and manufacturers of business-jet aircraft and is a leader in the long-range and ultra-long-range, large-cabin business-jet market, as well as in the business-jet-service and product-support market. In 2005, the business-jet market continued to strengthen, reflecting an improved global economy and higher U.S. corporate earnings. To meet growing demand and maximize the company’s opportunities in the business-aviation market, the Aerospace group is increasing annual deliveries at a prudent production rate while focusing on margin improvement and a continual effort to bring new technology and products to market through ongoing R&D efforts. The company expects continued growth in the business-jet market, particularly as the company’s new mid-sized G150 model enters full-rate production in 2006. General Dynamics’ management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices, disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements. The company’s solid performance over the past 10 years is measured in its sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow. General Dynamics’ record as an industry leader in cash flow generation has enabled it to consistently deploy resources to enhance shareholder returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchases. CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW Results of Operations General Dynamics’ net sales grew to $21.2 billion in 2005, up $2.1 billion, or 11 percent, over 2004. The company’s Information Systems and Technology group contributed over half of the sales increase in 2005, in large part from continued strong demand for the group’s tactical and strategic communications and computing products. The Combat Systems and Aerospace groups also experienced strong sales growth during the year, while sales in the Marine Systems group were consistent with 2004. Operating earnings increased 13 percent in 2005 to $2.2 billion compared with $1.9 billion in 2004. The growth in earnings resulted from the increased volume in Information Systems and Technology, Combat Systems, and Aerospace. In addition, the Aerospace group’s earnings increased at almost double the rate of sales in 2005 driven by a number of factors resulting from improved demand for the company’s business jets over the past two years. Increased earnings were offset in part by program losses in the Marine Systems group. Overall, the company’s operating margins increased to 10.3 percent in 2005 compared with 10.2 percent in 2004. Net sales increased 17 percent in 2004 over 2003, reaching $19.1 billion. This sales growth came from increased volume across all of the company’s primary business groups, and acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems groups. In 2004, operating earnings increased at twice the rate of sales growth. Earnings improved from $1.4 billion in 2003 to $1.9 billion in 2004, an increase of 35 percent. Improved performance in each of the company’s major business groups contributed to the growth in earnings. The Aerospace group produced substantially improved earnings on steady volume as a result of significant cost-cutting efforts and process improvements, while Marine Systems experienced fewer losses on its commercial shipbuilding programs compared with 2003. As a result, the company’s operating margins jumped from 8.8 percent in 2003 to 10.2 percent in 2004. 20 General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents The company’s cash flow from operating activities significantly exceeded net earnings in each of the past three years, continuing the company’s consistent record of generating substantial cash from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion in 2005 compared with $1.8 billion in 2004 and $1.7 billion in 2003. In addition, the company generated over $300 in cash from the sale of several non-core businesses in 2005. Over the three-year period, the company used its cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase its common stock, pay dividends and reduce its outstanding debt. General and administrative (G&A) expenses as a percentage of sales were 6.2 percent in 2005 compared with 6.1 percent in 2004 and 6.6 percent in 2003. G&A was $1.3 billion in 2005, $1.2 billion in 2004 and $1.1 billion in 2003. The company expects 2006 G&A as a percent of sales to approximate the 2005 rate. In 2005, the company had income from non-operating items of $21 compared with net expense of $8 in 2004 and income of $3 in 2003. The income in 2005 consisted primarily of sales of assets. Net interest expense was $118 in 2005, a reduction of $30 from 2004. The decrease resulted from interest income generated by the company’s strong cash position during the year. Net interest increased to $148 in 2004 from $98 in 2003 because of a higher average borrowing balance from the company’s issuance of additional debt in 2003 to fund acquisitions. The company’s effective tax rate was 30.1 percent in 2005, 32.6 percent in 2004 and 27.3 percent in 2003. In 2005, the company favorably resolved its 1999 to 2002 audit with the Internal Revenue Service. This settlement resulted in a $66 non-cash benefit, which reduced the company’s 2005 tax rate by 3.1 percent. The 2003 tax rate benefited from the settlement of the 1996 to 1998 federal audit and the resolution of some outstanding state tax disputes. These events resulted in non-cash benefits in 2003 totaling $68, favorably impacting the company’s tax rate by 5 percent. The company anticipates an effective tax rate of approximately 34 percent in 2006 excluding the effect of potential settlements or other discrete events. For additional discussion of tax matters, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2004, General Dynamics reviewed its businesses to identify operations that were not core to the company and could be divested. As a result, the company completed the sale of several small businesses in the second half of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005. The company’s reported net sales for all periods presented exclude the revenues associated with these businesses. Their earnings, however, are included as discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for all periods. The company received approximately $300 in cash, net of taxes, in 2005 from the sale of these businesses. For additional discussion of these divestiture activities, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog General Dynamics’ total backlog increased by $400 during 2005, reaching $42.4 billion at December 31. Funded backlog was $28.4 billion at year end. Significant order activity in each of the company’s business groups led to total new orders of $22.4 billion during the year despite a postponement of some order activity in the fourth quarter due to the delayed 2006 Department of Defense budget process. The total backlog for the company’s defense businesses was $34.1 billion at the end of 2005, compared with $34.9 billion at year-end 2004. The defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog was $22.3 billion at December 31, 2005. This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. The unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, the company has included in backlog only those programs that it believes are likely to receive funding. The backlog does not include work awarded under indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The total potential value of these contracts, which may be realized over the next 15 years, was approximately $6 billion as of December 31, 2005. The Aerospace group’s total backlog grew 18 percent in 2005, reaching a record level of $8.1 billion at December 31. The Aerospace funded backlog, an indicator of near-term demand, grew 26 percent to $5.9 billion at year end as a result of continued strong new aircraft orders in 2005. The funded backlog includes orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. The Aerospace unfunded backlog of $2.2 billion at December 31, 2005, consists of options to purchase new aircraft and agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The Resources group contributed $230 to the company’s backlog at year-end 2005, including funded backlog of $165. General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report 21 Table of Contents REVIEW OF OPERATING SEGMENTS INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 7,826 $ 6,722 $ 1,104 16 % Operating earnings 865 718 147 20 % Operating margin 11.1 % 10.7 % The Information Systems and Technology group’s sales and operating earnings increased substantially in 2005 compared with 2004. The group experienced a significant increase in activity in 2005 on its programs that provide secure communications and network systems to U.S. forces around the world. This demand is driven by both the Department of Defense and the U.S. intelligence community’s continuing effort to improve command-and-control and information-sharing capabilities, and the extensive deployment of U.S. forces in the Global War on Terrorism. These programs include: • Intelligence Information, Command-and-Control Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2), which supports critical intelligence and command-and-control systems and networks for U.S. defense and intelligence operations worldwide; • Common Hardware/Software III (CHS-3), which provides continually updated commercial and ruggedized computers, network equipment and software to the U.S. armed forces and other federal agencies worldwide; • Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), which enables on-the-move satellite connectivity for U.S. and allied forces; and • “Cluster 5” of the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), under which the group is developing small, lightweight software-defined radios for use by all branches of the U.S. military. Information Systems and Technology’s support of international customers’ command-and-control and communications needs also contributed to the significant sales volume in 2005. These programs include most notably the BOWMAN and Combat, Infrastructure and Platform (CIP) programs for the United Kingdom and the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP). BOWMAN is a secure digital voice and data communications system for the U.K. armed forces. The related CIP program is the new digital command-and-control system for U.K. ground and joint forces. Under the MHP contract, the company is providing integrated mission systems for 28 state-of-the-art helicopters that are intended to replace Canada’s aging fleet of marine helicopters. Acquisitions in 2004 and 2005 contributed about 40 percent of the group’s 2005 sales growth. During 2005, the company completed three acquisitions to strengthen its market position – MAYA Viz Ltd., in April; Tadpole Computer, Inc., in August; and Itronix Corporation in September. The company acquired Spectrum Astro, Inc., and TriPoint Global Communications Inc. in the second half of 2004. The operating results of these businesses have been included as of the respective dates of the acquisitions. The increase in sales excluding the effect of acquisitions was 10 percent. Operating margins in 2005 improved over 2004 due to the timing and mix of contract performance phases and customer deliveries, and the continued integration of acquired businesses. The company expects single-digit sales growth in the Information Systems and Technology group in 2006 with operating margins similar to the average margins achieved in 2005, though margins may fluctuate from period to period. Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 6,722 $ 4,848 $ 1,874 39 % Operating earnings 718 533 185 35 % Operating margin 10.7 % 11.0 % The solid growth in Information Systems and Technology in 2005 followed a significant increase in sales in 2004. The group experienced considerable growth in sales and operating earnings in 2004 due to increased volume across all areas of its business mix, including: • communications products, such as the BOWMAN program for the U.K. armed forces and the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) program for the U.S. Army; • global mission solutions, such as the ICE2 contract for the U.S. Air Force; • surveillance and reconnaissance systems; and • network infrastructure and wireless systems. Acquisitions in 2003 and 2004 contributed about half of the sales growth in 2004. The group’s operating margins decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 from a shift in program mix and the impact of lower-margin businesses acquired in 2003. Backlog 22 General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents The Information Systems and Technology group finished 2005 with a total backlog of $9.4 billion, up slightly from $9.3 billion at the end of 2004. The group maintained this substantial level of backlog despite record sales volume in 2005 due to a significant amount of order activity during the year. The group’s funded backlog was $7 billion at December 31, 2005, approximately 75 percent of the total backlog. Unlike the company’s other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog is comprised primarily of a large number of mid-size contracts and programs as well as several large-scale, long-term programs awarded over the past few years. Several significant awards contributed to the backlog in 2005. The group received an order from the Army to integrate up to 500 Land Warrior soldier ensembles into a Stryker experimental battalion. Land Warrior uses advanced combat technology to enhance individual soldiers’ tactical awareness, lethality and survivability. This award is part of a contract valued at approximately $260. In 2005, the Army merged the Land Warrior and Future Force Warrior programs into one contract managed by General Dynamics to expedite the fielding of this integrated system. The group’s backlog at December 31, 2005, included approximately $350 for the Army’s Future Combat Systems (FCS) program. The Army realigned the FCS program in 2005 to expedite delivery of newly developed technologies to existing forces. In addition, the company was awarded modifications to several of its contracts under the FCS program. The group received $210 in orders in 2005, including a modification worth $154 to accelerate technology development of the program’s integrated computer system by two years. Combat Systems also performs work on the FCS program. Information Systems and Technology received a contract worth $170 to design, manufacture and deliver 25 12-meter antennas for an advanced radio telescope array at an international astronomy facility. The antennas are a critical element of a project intended to provide the world’s most sensitive, highest resolution telescope to enable scientists to observe and image galaxies, stars and planets with unprecedented clarity. The Navy awarded the group a contract with a potential value of approximately $150 through 2009 to provide fire control system production, operational support, field engineering services, training and development for the Navy’s Trident ballistic missile submarines. The group was awarded a contract worth over $100 to support the development of New York’s Statewide Wireless Network. The network is intended to improve communications and enhance coordination for state and local public safety and public service organizations responding to emergency situations across New York. Information Systems and Technology was selected to provide all site integration activities, including program and construction management and site development for all radio-access site infrastructure. The Navy awarded the group a contract to provide system integration and design agent services for the Open Architecture Track Manager. The track manager is an improved component within naval combat systems that receives and translates information to create an integrated picture of the locations and paths of aircraft, ships and submarines in the battle space. The contract has a potential value of approximately $100. In 2005, the group experienced significant demand from international customers for its communications and IT products and services. The group is a member of the team that was selected in 2005 by the U.K. Ministry of Defence for the first increment of the Defence Information Infrastructure (Future) program. The program calls for consolidation of numerous existing information networks into a single infrastructure and is a key component of the United Kingdom’s future military strategy. The company’s subcontract is worth approximately $220, with options valued at an additional $300. The group received a contract from the Royal Netherlands Navy worth approximately $115 to supply the New Integrated Marines Communications and Information Systems (NIMCIS). NIMCIS is a two-year program to equip the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps with a BOWMAN-like communications system. The group leads a team selected by the Commonwealth of Australia to serve as the preferred prime system integrator for the first phase of the Battlespace Communications System (Land) program (JP 2072). JP 2072 is intended to provide the Australian Land Force with a deployable, scalable, secure and integrated battlespace communications system that allows ground forces to exchange information across all combat elements, improving soldiers’ safety and their ability to accomplish their missions. The group’s contract has an initial value of approximately $75, and the total program has a potential value of approximately $600 if all options are exercised. The group’s backlog does not include approximately $4.8 billion of potential contract value awarded under IDIQ contracts. IDIQ contracts are used when a customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed. These agreements set forth the majority of the contractual terms, including prices, but are funded as delivery orders are placed. A significant portion of this IDIQ value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the sole-source supplier over several years to design, develop, produce and integrate complex products and systems for the military or other government agencies. Management believes that the customers intend to fully implement these systems. However, because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer’s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders, the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. In 2005, funding from customers under these IDIQ contracts contributed approximately $1.8 billion to the group’s backlog. Information Systems and Technology was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2005, including a modification providing approximately $150 in funding for its Rescue 21 search-and-rescue communications system for the U.S. Coast Guard. The award brings the funded contract value to over $300. This IDIQ contract has a potential value of approximately $750 if all options are exercised. The Army awarded the group the Total Engineering and Integration Services (TEIS) contract, an IDIQ multiple-award contract to provide information technology engineering and technical support at customer sites worldwide. The TEIS contract has a performance period of one base year and four option years with a ceiling value of approximately $800. General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report 23 Table of Contents COMBAT SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 5,021 $ 4,407 $ 614 14 % Operating earnings 576 522 54 10 % Operating margin 11.5 % 11.8 % The Combat Systems group produced strong growth in net sales and operating earnings in 2005 compared with 2004. The largest contributor to the increase was the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program. Volume on this program increased significantly in 2005 as the group continued production of the fourth and fifth brigades and began work on the Mobile Gun System. Demand for add-on armor spurred additional program activity. Other notable volume increases include the M1A2 Abrams tank System Enhancement Package (SEP) program, the Canadian RG-31 mine-protected personnel vehicle contract and the Saudi Arabian National Guard light armored vehicle contract. In the armaments and munitions businesses, demand increased in 2005 for reactive armor, counter-improvised explosive device (IED) systems, and large-, medium- and small-caliber ammunition. These increases were offset in part by the completion of several international combat vehicle programs in 2004, including the Ulan tracked armored vehicle program and the Australian and New Zealand light armored vehicle programs. Sales were also down in the group’s European business as a result of delays in the timing of customer requirements. Additionally, Combat Systems experienced a temporary decline in volume in 2005 on the Hydra-70 rocket production program, as the group transitioned to a new contract awarded during the year. Operating margins were down slightly in 2005 compared with 2004 because of a shift in product mix and the timing of deliveries in the group’s European business. The company expects Combat Systems to produce double-digit sales growth overall in 2006, with particularly strong growth in the group’s European business as the work that was deferred in 2005 is realized. Operating margins in 2006 should be consistent with the full-year 2005 margins. Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 4,407 $ 4,007 $ 400 10 % Operating earnings 522 443 79 18 % Operating margin 11.8 % 11.1 % The Combat Systems group’s net sales and operating earnings increased in 2004 compared with 2003 from increased demand for the group’s products in the United States and internationally. Several armored vehicle programs in the group’s European business contributed to the sales and earnings growth, including Leopard tanks, Ulan tracked infantry vehicles and Piranha wheeled combat vehicles. Activity also increased on the group’s contract to develop manned ground vehicles for the Army’s FCS program and in its munitions and armaments businesses. This growth was reduced by a lower volume of M1 Abrams tank upgrades and reduced deliveries on the Stryker program due to the timing of customer requirements. Operating earnings increased at almost double the rate of sales growth in 2004 because of improved performance on several of the group’s programs and a shift in contract mix. Backlog The Combat Systems group’s backlog increased 7 percent in 2005, reaching $9.3 billion at December 31. Funded backlog increased 9 percent over 2004 to $7 billion at year end. The group’s backlog consists primarily of long-term production contracts with scheduled deliveries through 2013. The group’s backlog at December 31, 2005, included approximately $1.9 billion for the Army’s FCS program. In 2005, Combat Systems was awarded a $282 modification to its contract for the engineering development and demonstration of a family of manned ground vehicles. The modification extends the contract through 2012. The group also received a modification valued at approximately $50 under its contract to develop the autonomous navigation system for FCS ground vehicles. Information Systems and Technology is performing additional work on the FCS program. The Combat Systems group’s backlog at year end also included approximately $1.2 billion for the production of Stryker wheeled combat vehicles. In 2005, the group received orders from the Army valued at approximately $1.5 billion under the Stryker program. These awards included the production of 423 vehicles to equip the fifth Stryker brigade, add-on armor sets and engineering services. Also included in the awards was an order for 99 Stryker vehicles to meet additional Army requirements and a contract for the refurbishment of 265 Stryker infantry combat vehicles returning from duty in Iraq. Under this contract, the company will service, repair and modify the Stryker vehicles, restoring them to pre-combat, like-new condition before their next deployment. 24 General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents In 2005, the Army also awarded the Combat Systems group two contracts worth approximately $300 to upgrade 124 M1A2 Abrams tanks to the M1A2 SEP configuration. Through this program, the company retrofits M1A2 tanks with improved electronics, command-and-control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank’s effectiveness. Combat Systems received a contract valued at approximately $130 for the production of Towed Artillery Digitization (TAD) Digital Fire Control Systems (DFCS) for the M777 howitzer. This system provides sensors, displays, mission computers, power supplies and communication systems that support the M777 155mm howitzer used by the Army and Marines Corps. In addition, in February 2006, the group received an order worth approximately $130 from the Marine Corps to provide eight-wheeled light armored vehicles (LAV) in various configurations. The contract has a total potential value of over $300 for a total of 130 vehicles to be delivered in 2007 and 2008. Internationally, in 2005 the group finalized a contract with the Government of Portugal to produce 260 Pandur II armored combat vehicles. The contract is valued at approximately $480, and deliveries are scheduled to begin in 2007 and continue through 2009. The Combat Systems group has several international, long-term combat vehicle production contracts in backlog as of December 31, 2005. The group’s Leopard program is a long-term battle tank manufacturing contract for the Spanish army under license from a German company. The group’s backlog at the end of 2005 included over $700 for the production of 181 Leopard tanks, with deliveries scheduled through 2009. The group also produces Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles for the Spanish army. The year-end backlog included $665 for the production of 212 Pizarro vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2012. In January 2006, Combat Systems received several orders for its combat vehicles from European customers, further demonstrating the appeal of these vehicles in the international market. The group was selected by the Czech Republic to produce 199 eight-wheeled Pandur II armored personnel carriers between 2007 and 2012 for the Czech army. The contract, which is expected to be finalized and added to backlog in the first half of 2006, has an option for 35 additional vehicles and is worth up to $1 billion. The Belgian government selected the group’s Piranha light armored vehicle for its Armored Infantry Vehicle program. The program calls for up to 242 vehicles and related logistics support and is worth approximately $600 if all options are exercised. The group also received an order from the Irish Department of Defence valued at approximately $40 for 15 Piranha vehicles. The Combat Systems group’s backlog at year end also included approximately $1.4 billion in armament, munitions and composite-structures programs. In 2005, the group received funding of approximately $150 for the production of Hydra-70 (70mm) rockets, motors and warheads. These orders are part of a five-year requirements contract with an estimated value of $900. The group was also awarded an initial order of $170 under a five-year contract to supply 300-500 million rounds per year of small-caliber ammunition to the U.S. armed forces. The contract has a total potential value of approximately $1.2 billion if all options are exercised. Additionally, the group received contract modifications worth approximately $90 for the production of enhanced-capability reactive armor tile sets for Army Bradley Fighting Vehicles. In February 2006, the group received an IDIQ contract from the Marine Corps with a potential value of approximately $290 to develop, design, integrate, produce and install IED Electronic Countermeasure systems. MARINE SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 4,695 $ 4,726 $ (31 ) (1 )% Operating earnings 249 292 (43 ) (15 )% Operating margin 5.3 % 6.2 % The Marine Systems group’s net sales remained steady in 2005 compared with 2004. Activity on the Virginia-class submarine and T-AKE combat logistics ship construction programs increased significantly in 2005. Construction is in progress on the second through seventh ships of the Virginia class and the first three of nine T-AKE ships under contract. The volume increase in these programs was offset by the completion of the Seawolf-class submarine program in 2004, decreased activity on the group’s commercial tanker contract, and fewer repair and engineering contracts. Program losses in 2004 and 2005 adversely affected operating earnings and margins in Marine Systems. The company continued to experience losses on its contract to build four double-hull oil tankers. In 2003 and 2004, the company recorded losses on this contract related to performance problems, schedule delays and subcontractor difficulties. In 2005, additional schedule delays and labor hour growth resulted in a loss of $50 on the program. The second and third ships were delivered in 2005, and the final ship is scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of 2006. Management does not expect any additional charges on the commercial tanker program, though risk will remain until the final ship is delivered. The group also recorded losses totaling approximately $20 in the first half of 2005 on two submarine maintenance and overhaul contracts. These losses resulted from customer-requested change orders that the group fulfilled prior to securing adequate contractual protection. The company is in negotiations with the customer to recover some of the incurred costs and does not expect to have this type of exposure on future submarine overhaul contracts. The group has also experienced cost growth on the Navy’s T-AKE program primarily from engineering- and design-related changes imposed by the customer. The company has submitted a formal request for equitable adjustment with the customer seeking more than $500 of additional contract payments for the rework effort and scope growth caused General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report 25 Table of Contents by these changes. The company is recording revenue at a break-even level based on the assumed recovery of a portion of this claim (see Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The company is in discussions with the Navy to quantify its contractual relief for the unanticipated costs and expects the resolution of this matter to take several quarters. As of December 31, 2005, the first T-AKE was 91 percent complete, the second ship was 51 percent complete, and construction had begun on the third ship. The first ship is scheduled to be delivered in the second quarter of 2006. The company expects the Marine Systems group’s sales in 2006 to be similar to the 2005 volume with improving margins, assuming no further program losses. Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 4,726 $ 4,271 $ 455 11 % Operating earnings 292 216 76 35 % Operating margin 6.2 % 5.1 % In 2004, the group’s net sales increased compared with 2003 from higher volume on the Virginia-class and T-AKE programs and the conversion of Trident ballistic-missile submarines to a conventional-strike configuration (SSGN). Engineering and repair contract activity was also up in 2004. Lower volume on commercial shipbuilding contracts and mature defense production programs partially offset the growth in these programs. Operating earnings and margins improved significantly because of improved results on the group’s commercial shipbuilding programs in 2004 relative to 2003. Backlog The Marine Systems group’s backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as repair and engineering contracts. The group’s total backlog as of December 31, 2005, was $15.4 billion, including $8.4 billion of funded backlog. The 2005 backlog was down 8 percent from the previous year as the group continued its progress on the significant volume of awards received in 2003. The current backlog provides for shipbuilding programs through 2014. The Virginia-class submarine program is the group’s largest contract in backlog. The lead ship in the class was delivered in 2004, and the company’s backlog included $8.3 billion at December 31, 2005, for the construction of the nine additional submarines under contract. The current Navy plan calls for one submarine to be delivered per year through 2011 and two per year starting in 2012. The company is the prime contractor on this program, and construction is shared equally with its teaming partner. In 2005, the Navy awarded Marine Systems a contract worth over $100 to provide lead-yard services and research-and-development studies for Virginia-class submarines in support of the related construction contract. In January 2006, the Navy awarded the group a contract modification worth $1.3 billion that provides funding for the construction of the eighth Virginia-class submarine and advance procurement for the ninth and tenth ships. The group’s backlog at year-end 2005 included $2.5 billion for nine Arleigh Burke-class DDG destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2010. In 2005, the Navy awarded the company approximately $560 in funding to construct the final destroyer under contract in the DDG program. The Navy exercised two options in 2005 worth approximately $590 for the seventh and eighth ships in the T-AKE program, bringing the total contract value to $2.5 billion. The group’s backlog at the end of 2005 included $1.7 billion for the construction of the first eight T-AKE ships. Deliveries of these ships are scheduled through 2008. In January 2006, the Navy exercised an option worth approximately $320 for the ninth T-AKE ship, bringing the total contract value to $2.8 billion. In 2005, the Navy modified the Marine Systems group’s SSGN contract, adding approximately $320. Under this contract, the company is converting four Trident ballistic-missile submarines to an SSGN configuration, a multi-mission submarine optimized for tactical strike and special operations support. The 2005 awards cover the conversion of the third and fourth ships, the USS Michigan and the USS Georgia, and bring the total value of the contract to $1.3 billion. The conversion of the USS Ohio was completed in 2005. Marine Systems leads one of two teams selected for the development and construction of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), the Navy’s newest class of high-speed surface combatants. LCS ships are designed to operate in coastal areas against terrorist threats, high-speed swarm boats, mines and diesel submarines. In 2005, the Navy exercised an option worth $223 for the detailed design and construction of the LCS. The company’s first LCS is expected to be delivered in 2007. The group also received a seven-year contract from the Navy in 2005 worth approximately $200 for the maintenance and repair of four LSD-class and four LPD-class ships. These amphibious ships transport Marines and their combat equipment to areas throughout the world, and launch and support landing craft and helicopters during amphibious assault and other military operations. 26 General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents AEROSPACE Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 3,433 $ 3,012 $ 421 14 % Operating earnings 495 393 102 26 % Operating margin 14.4 % 13.0 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 89 78 Completion 84 77 The Aerospace group’s net sales increased in 2005 compared with 2004 on a significant jump in new aircraft volume and higher aircraft services activity. The company delivered 11 more green units and seven more completions in 2005 than in 2004, reflecting a strong increase in demand over the past two years. Pre-owned sales declined as the group’s customers increasingly opt to sell their pre-owned aircraft in the market rather than trading them in with the company. The group’s 2005 operating earnings increased significantly over 2004. A number of factors contributed to this strong earnings growth. Earnings in new aircraft manufacturing improved due to a combination of increased deliveries, a more favorable mix of units delivered and improving pricing. Aircraft services earnings increased from the higher volume and improved cost performance. Pre-owned aircraft earnings were up substantially on three fewer deliveries as market conditions continue to improve. New aircraft orders in 2005 exceeded 2004’s record level, and new aircraft pricing continued to improve during the year. Gulfstream has raised its planned production for 2006 by more than 25 percent over 2005, and the 2006 production schedule is substantially sold out. The company expects significant sales growth in the Aerospace group in 2006 with margins that approximate those achieved in 2005. The company expects a shift in mix in the group starting in 2006 due to increased production of lower-margin, mid-size aircraft with the introduction of the new G150. Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 3,012 $ 2,946 $ 66 2 % Operating earnings 393 218 175 80 % Operating margin 13.0 % 7.4 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 78 74 Completion 77 74 Net sales in the Aerospace group grew slightly in 2004 over 2003. Increased new aircraft sales and higher aircraft services activity were offset by lower pre-owned aircraft sales. Operating earnings and margins increased substantially in 2004 because of significant cost reductions, higher earnings on pre-owned aircraft sales and a more favorable mix of aircraft deliveries. Summary of Aircraft Statistical Information Sales contracts for new aircraft usually have two major milestones: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s completion, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics. The company records revenues when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The following table summarizes key unit data for the Aerospace group’s orders and backlog: Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 New orders 124 96 75 Options exercised — 1 3 Firm orders 124 97 78 Cancellations (a) (3 ) (2 ) (12 ) Total orders 121 95 66 New options — — 3 Firm contracts in backlog 207 175 158 Options in backlog 100 100 103 Total aircraft in backlog 307 275 261 Completions in backlog (b) 42 39 38 (a) Excludes fractional activity, because orders are made under master agreements that the customer draws down over several years. The company received cancellations for seven aircraft in 2003 from fractional fleet customers. (b) Represents aircraft that have moved from green production to the completion process as of year end. Backlog includes only the value of the completion effort on these aircraft. New Aircraft Book-to-Bill Ratio 2003-2005* * Represents ratio of new aircraft orders to deliveries (in units) during the year. Deliveries include 12 units in 2005, 10 units in 2004 and two units in 2003 to fractional fleet customers. General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report 27 Table of Contents Backlog The Aerospace group’s backlog exceeded $8 billion at the end of 2005, an increase of 18 percent over 2004. The group’s funded backlog grew 26 percent in 2005 to $5.9 billion at year end, representing almost 75 percent of the total backlog. The group received 124 orders in 2005, 28 percent more than the record number of orders received in 2004, excluding fractional activity. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Aerospace group achieved a book-to-bill ratio (net orders divided by sales) greater than one for the sixth consecutive quarter. The group’s backlog includes aircraft deliveries through 2011. A significant portion of the group’s backlog is with NetJets Inc. (NetJets), a unit of Berkshire Hathaway and the leader in the fractional aircraft market. NetJets purchases the aircraft for use in its fractional ownership program. The group’s funded backlog at year end included $1.6 billion with NetJets, representing firm contracts for 91 aircraft, including 15 green aircraft that are scheduled for delivery in 2006. The unfunded backlog included $1.4 billion for 100 aircraft options from NetJets, constituting all of the options in backlog. NetJets also represented 69 percent of the maintenance and support services in unfunded backlog. Deliveries of aircraft to NetJets are scheduled from 2006 through 2011 and represent as little as 4 percent and as much as 11 percent of projected new aircraft sales in those years. The group’s remaining $4.3 billion of funded backlog at year-end 2005 consisted of contracts with a broad range of customers from a variety of industries and included approximately $470 of contracts with government customers. Scheduled Deliveries of Aerospace Funded Backlog RESOURCES The company’s Resources group consists of two businesses: a coal mining company and an aggregates company that supplies the construction industry. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 269 $ 252 $ 17 7 % Operating earnings 12 19 (7 ) (37 )% The Resources group’s net sales increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to higher volume in the aggregates business. Operating earnings decreased in 2005 as a result of adjustments to certain contingent liabilities based on newly available information. On March 1, 2006, the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its aggregates business. The company expects the transaction to close in the first half of 2006. Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 252 $ 256 $ (4 ) (2 )% Operating earnings 19 32 (13 ) (41 )% The group’s net sales in 2004 decreased slightly compared with 2003 as lower volume in the coal business was largely offset by increased activity in the aggregates business. The group’s 2004 operating earnings were lower than 2003 because the earnings in 2003 were favorably impacted by the reduction of surface reclamation obligations in the company’s coal mining operations. 28 General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In the mid-1990s, General Dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment, generating strong cash flow to enable a series of acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond its core platform businesses. These acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded the company’s customer base. Since 1995, the company has acquired 40 businesses at a total cost of almost $14 billion. This has resulted in a larger, more diversified company while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility. General Dynamics’ management continues to emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities greatly exceeded net earnings for the third consecutive year. The company employed this cash to complete three niche acquisitions, continue its trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase its outstanding shares. The company ended 2005 with a cash balance of $2.3 billion, total debt of $3.3 billion and a debt-to-capital ratio of 28.8 percent. Free cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in 2005 compared with $1.5 billion in both 2004 and 2003. Management defines free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays the company’s ability to generate cash from its core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing its common stock and paying dividends. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,056 $ 1,800 $ 1,721 Capital expenditures (279 ) (264 ) (220 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 1,777 $ 1,536 $ 1,501 Cash flows as a percentage of net earnings: Net cash provided by operating activities 141 % 147 % 171 % Free cash flow from operations 122 % 125 % 150 % Over the past 10 years, the company has generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of its net earnings during the period. With free cash flow from operations projected to approximate net earnings in 2006, the company expects to continue to generate funds in excess of its short- and long-term liquidity needs. Management believes that the company has adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute its financial and operating strategy. The following is a discussion of the company’s major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion in 2005, $1.8 billion in 2004 and $1.7 billion in 2003. In each year, net earnings was the primary driver of the company’s cash flow. In 2005, the additional cash flow was due to a high level of customer deposits associated with the order activity in the Aerospace group and a significant inflow of customer advances in the fourth quarter in the company’s European business. In 2004, cash from operating activities exceeded net earnings due primarily to the timing of tax payments. In 2003, the increase in cash flow was attributable to substantial reductions in both new and pre-owned aircraft inventory in the Aerospace group and an influx of customer advances near the end of the year. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to the company’s expectations, the default termination ultimately is sustained, the company and The Boeing Company could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2005. If this were the outcome, the government contends the company would owe approximately $1.3 billion. The company’s after-tax cash obligation would be approximately $640. The company believes that it has sufficient resources to pay such an obligation, if required, while still retaining ample liquidity. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $181 in 2005, $781 in 2004 and $3.2 billion in 2003. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures. In 2005, these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from divestiture activities. Business Acquisitions. In 2005, the company completed three acquisitions for a total of approximately $275. On April 1, the company acquired MAYA Viz Ltd., of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On August 16, the company acquired Tadpole Computer, Inc., of Cupertino, California. On September 2, the company acquired Itronix Corporation of Spokane, Washington. In 2004, the company completed three acquisitions at a total cost of approximately $500. On July 9, the company acquired Spectrum Astro, Inc., of Gilbert, Arizona. On September 17, the company acquired TriPoint Global Communications Inc., based in Newton, North Carolina. On November 1, the company acquired Engineering Technology Inc., of Orlando, Florida. On August 11, 2003, the company completed its acquisition of Veridian Corporation, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, for approximately $1.5 billion in cash. On March 1, 2003, the company acquired GM Defense of London, Ontario, a business unit of General Motors Corporation, for approximately $1.1 billion in cash. The company completed several other business acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology, Combat Systems and Aerospace groups during 2003 at a total cost of approximately $470. The company financed these acquisitions by issuing commercial paper. The company refinanced a substantial portion of its commercial paper during 2003, as discussed in Financing Activities. General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report 29 Table of Contents In the fourth quarter of 2005, General Dynamics entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Anteon International Corporation for approximately $2.2 billion, including the assumption of debt. The company intends to finance the acquisition with cash on hand and commercial paper and expects the transaction to close in the first half of 2006. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $279 in 2005, $264 in 2004 and $220 in 2003. The company expects capital expenditures of approximately $425 in 2006. The anticipated increase over 2005 relates to planned facility improvements at Gulfstream and certain projects that were delayed in 2005. The company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2005. Sale of Assets. In 2005, the company completed the sales of several small, non-core businesses. The company received approximately $300 in cash, net of tax payments, from these divestiture activities. In 2004, the company sold two small, non-core businesses. The company sold its remaining real estate holdings in southern California in 2004. During 2003 and 2004, the company received a total of $40 in cash in connection with these land sales. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $520 in 2005 and $904 in 2004 compared with $2 billion of cash generated in 2003. The company’s typical financing activities are issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Debt Proceeds, Net. There were no material debt repayments in 2005. In 2004, the company repaid $500 of floating-rate notes that matured in September. In 2003, the company issued $3.1 billion of medium-term fixed-rate debt securities under a Form S-3 Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The proceeds of this debt were used to repay a substantial portion of the company’s commercial paper in 2003, which had the effect of fixing interest rates on debt that previously carried variable rates. Net repayments of commercial paper were $182 in 2004 and $529 in 2003. As of December 31, 2004 and 2005, the company had no commercial paper outstanding. The company has $2 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon and are used to provide backup liquidity to the commercial paper program. In the second quarter of 2006, $500 of the company’s fixed-rate debt securities is scheduled to mature. Dividends. On March 1, 2006, the company’s board of directors declared an increased regular quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share – the ninth consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share in March 2005, to $0.36 per share in March 2004 and to $0.32 per share in March 2003. Share Repurchases. During 2005, the company repurchased 3.3 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market at an average price of $107 per share. The company did not repurchase any shares during 2004. In 2003, the company repurchased 4.7 million shares at an average price of $64 per share. As of December 31, 2005, the company had approximately 1.2 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2005, other than operating leases, the company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements, such as guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to the company’s stock and classified in shareholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; and variable interests in entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company or engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the company. Contractual Obligations The following table presents information about the company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005: Payment Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 4,038 $ 636 $ 914 $ 881 $ 1,607 Capital lease obligations 8 2 4 2 — Operating leases 808 143 229 152 284 Purchase obligations (b) 16,078 7,546 4,786 2,147 1,599 Other long-term liabilities (c) 3,617 1,180 850 378 1,209 $ 24,549 $ 9,507 $ 6,783 $ 3,560 $ 4,699 (a) Includes scheduled interest payments. (b) Includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. This amount includes $11.5 billion of purchase orders for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which the company has full recourse under normal contract termination clauses. As disclosed in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company expects to make approximately $40 of contributions to its retirement plans in 2006. This amount has been excluded from the above amount. (c) Represents other long-term liabilities on the company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, including the current portion of long-term liabilities. The projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management’s estimates, which are largely based on historical experience. 30 General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents Commercial Commitments The following table presents information about the company’s commercial commitments as of December 31, 2005: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period Commercial Commitments Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Letters of credit* $ 1,615 $ 991 $ 235 $ 10 $ 379 Trade-in options* 570 210 360 — — $ 2,185 $ 1,201 $ 595 $ 10 $ 379 * See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of letters of credit and aircraft trade-in options. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the company’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to long-term contracts and programs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers’ compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft inventory, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition – Government Contracts. The company accounts for sales and earnings under long-term government contracts and programs using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The company follows the guidelines of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts, except that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, rather than the cumulative catch-up method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term, while under the cumulative catch-up method such impact would be recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified. Anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts, including G&A expenses. The company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input (e.g., costs incurred) or output (e.g., units delivered) measures, as appropriate to the circumstances. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications. These estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the timing of product deliveries. These estimates are based on the company’s best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company’s contracts. The company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method. Business Aircraft. The company accounts for contracts for aircraft certified by the FAA in accordance with Statement of Position 81-1. These contracts usually provide for two major milestones: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft (i.e., before exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics) and its completion. The company records revenue at two points: when green aircraft are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report 31 Table of Contents The company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer. Pre-owned Aircraft Inventories. In connection with orders for new aircraft, the company routinely offers customers trade-in options. Under these options, if exercised, the company will accept trade-in aircraft at a predetermined price based on estimated fair value. It is the company’s policy to limit its investment in pre-owned aircraft inventory at any point in time to $200, unless specifically authorized. Once acquired in connection with a sale of new aircraft, the company records pre-owned aircraft at the lower of trade-in value or estimated net realizable value. The company treats any excess of the trade-in price above the net realizable value as a reduction of revenue upon the recording of the new aircraft sales transaction. The company also regularly assesses the carrying value of pre-owned aircraft in inventory and adjusts the carrying value to net realizable value when appropriate. The company determines net realizable value by using both internal and external aircraft valuation information. These valuations involve estimates and assumptions about many factors, including current market conditions, future market conditions, the age and condition of the aircraft and the availability of the aircraft in the market. These estimates are based on the company’s best judgment. Gross margins on sales of pre-owned aircraft can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of aircraft sold and current market conditions. Commitments and Contingencies. The company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of its business or arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. The company records a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when the company’s exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of the company’s government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of the company’s estimated workers’ compensation, other insurance-related assessments, post-retirement benefits and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts when they are paid. As permitted by AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Federal Government Contractors, the company has elected to defer these costs in contracts in process until they are paid, at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government. The company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business, including both existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. This business base includes numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. The company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under the company’s contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on the company’s best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of the company’s remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. The company’s defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to discount rates used to estimate future liabilities and long-term rates of return on plan assets. The company determines the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. The company determines the long-term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on the company’s best judgment, including consideration of both current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, future pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. If the assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets increased or decreased by 25 basis points, the company’s net pension income associated with its commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately $3 in 2005. Likewise, had the interest rate used to discount the company’s projected pension obligation increased or decreased by 25 basis points, the net pension income associated with the commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately $1 in 2005. A 25 basis-point increase or decrease in either the rate of return on assets or the interest rate used for benefit obligations for the company’s post-retirement benefit plans would have decreased or increased the 2005 post-retirement benefit cost by approximately $1. The company’s contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company’s government plans. As permitted by AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Federal Government Contractors, the company has elected to defer recognition of the cumulative earnings in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. As such, the company’s future income is not subject to the consequences of changes in the assumptions associated with these plans. Management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. 32 General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents New Accounting Standards In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation [SFAS 123(R)]. SFAS 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value. SFAS 123(R) is effective in the first quarter of 2006. Based on available information, the company expects the adoption of SFAS 123(R) to reduce its net earnings by approximately $35 to $40 in 2006. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 changes the requirements for accounting and reporting a change in accounting principle. The Statement requires a restatement of prior period financial statements upon adoption of a voluntary change in accounting principle rather than recording the cumulative effect of the change in net earnings in the current period. SFAS 154 is effective for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. The company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 154 to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations, variable-rate commercial paper and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2005, the company had no material short-term investments and no outstanding commercial paper. Fixed-rate debt obligations issued by the company are generally not putable and are not actively traded by the company in the market. Therefore, the company does not believe its exposure to interest rate risk is material for its fixed-rate debt. The company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2005, no interest rate swap agreements were in effect. The company also is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers, long-term debt and certain inter-company transactions in foreign currencies. The company principally uses foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign-denominated payments, receipts and inter-company transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company’s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized loss of $5 and $14 (pretax), respectively, and an incremental unrealized loss of $26 and $56 (pretax), respectively. This exchange rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rates. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, these realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.

40533,GD,GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP,2007,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (For an overview of the company’s business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW General Dynamics is a market leader in business aviation; land and expeditionary combat vehicles and systems, armaments, and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and mission-critical information systems and technologies. The company operates through four business groups — Aerospace, Combat Systems, Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology. General Dynamics’ primary customers are the U.S. military, other government organizations, the armed forces of allied nations, and a diverse base of corporate and individual buyers of business aircraft. The company operates in two primary markets — defense and business aviation. The majority of the company’s revenues derive from contracts with the U.S. military. 2006 Sales by Customer Base The nation’s engagement in the global war on terror, coupled with the need to modernize U.S. military forces, has driven steady Department of Defense funding increases since 2001. In particular, procurement and research and development (R&D) budgets, also known as investment accounts, provide the majority of the company’s revenues. These budget lines continue to enjoy sustained increases, demonstrating administration and congressional support. Defense Department funding has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 6 percent from fiscal 2001 through 2007, while procurement and R&D spending has grown 7 percent annually during that period. For fiscal year 2007, the Congress appropriated $435 billion for the Department of Defense, including approximately $156 billion for procurement and R&D. For fiscal year 2008, the President has requested that the Congress appropriate $481 billion for the Department of Defense, an 11 percent increase over the 2007 funding. This includes $177 billion for procurement and R&D, an increase of 13 percent over 2007. During this period of war, defense budgets have included the President’s budget submission, as well as supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year to meet the emergent needs of the warfighter. For fiscal year 2007, the administration requested, and the Congress appropriated, approximately $70 billion in supplemental funding. Congress has recently been asked to provide an additional $93 billion, which, if approved, will bring total defense funding for fiscal year 2007 to approximately $600 billion, an 87 percent increase since 2001. Notably, approximately 28 percent, or $45 billion, of the 2007 anticipated supplemental funding is requested for additional investment spending. While these supplemental funding requests have increased total defense spending levels, some military service accounts are under pressure as the services move funds among accounts to cover short-term war needs. In addition, supplemental appropriations do not include the level of program detail typically provided in general defense appropriations. These two factors have made it increasingly difficult to forecast the timing and amount of the impact of supplemental funding on the company’s programs. Looking ahead, the company expects the defense budget top line to remain well funded for the near term, led by the need to continue to support the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. While the landscape will continue to evolve during this dynamic period, the company expects near-term defense funding to be driven by the following: • continued support for the warfighter from the administration and the Congress, • the size of the U.S. military, including the number of troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and • the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed during the war. Based on the recently approved and proposed defense budgets, the company expects the levels of funding available for its programs will likely continue to grow in 2007 and 2008. Defense Funding 2001–2008 General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report 19 Table of Contents Beyond the company’s U.S. defense market, governments around the world are increasingly funding weapons and equipment modernization programs, leading to expanding defense export opportunities. The company is committed to pursuing international opportunities presented by foreign demand for military hardware and information technologies. While the revenue upside can be significant, European and other foreign defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing, defense priorities and overall fiscal spending pressures. As General Dynamics broadens the customer base for its defense products around the world, the company expects growing international sales. The business-aviation market also continues to expand, and 2006 was another strong year. In particular, the market for the company’s business jets outside the United States is growing at an increasingly rapid rate. In 2006, Gulfstream received 42 percent of its aircraft orders from outside North America. Of note, the European market, including Russia, made up more than 20 percent of the group’s orders in 2006, and demand remains strong. To meet this demand and maximize the company’s opportunities in the near term, the Aerospace group is increasing annual deliveries prudently while focusing on margins. Looking ahead, as part of a continual effort to bring new technology and products to market, the company is making investments in the Aerospace group’s facilities to support the robust global business-jet demand and a growing aircraft-services market. The company expects continued growth in the business-jet market, stemming from a strong product selection in the long-range and ultra-long-range markets, and robust sales of the company’s mid-size products. General Dynamics’ management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices, disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements. The company’s solid performance over the past 10 years is measured in its sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow. General Dynamics’ record as an industry leader in cash flow generation has enabled it to consistently deploy resources to enhance shareholder returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchases. CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW Results of Operations Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 24,063 $ 20,975 $ 3,088 15 % Operating earnings 2,625 2,179 446 20 % Operating margin 10.9 % 10.4 % General Dynamics’ net sales increased significantly in 2006, with each of the company’s business groups contributing to the sales growth. Increased new aircraft deliveries in the Aerospace group, strong demand for combat vehicles and armament and munitions products in the Combat Systems group, and acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology group were the most significant drivers of the increase in sales. Higher activity on early-stage ship construction programs in the Marine Systems group also added to the sales increase. The growth in the company’s operating earnings outpaced the increase in sales in 2006. Double-digit earnings growth occurred in all four businesses. A key driver was performance in the Marine Systems group, which saw operating earnings rise over 50 percent. In the Aerospace group, operating earnings increased significantly on strong volume in new aircraft sales and continued pricing improvements. For the company as a whole, this led to a 50 basis-point increase in the company’s operating margins to 10.9 percent in 2006 from 10.4 percent in 2005. The company’s focus on operations has led to improved margins in each of the last three years, resulting in a 210 basis-point improvement since 2003. 20 General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 20,975 $ 18,868 $ 2,107 11 % Operating earnings 2,179 1,931 248 13 % Operating margin 10.4 % 10.2 % The company produced strong growth in sales and operating earnings in 2005. The Information Systems and Technology group led the increase, generating over the half of the company’s sales growth over 2004. The Combat Systems and Aerospace groups also contributed to the increase in sales, while the Marine Systems group’s sales in 2005 were steady compared with 2004. Increased volume in the Information Systems and Technology, Combat Systems and Aerospace groups drove the growth in operating earnings. The company’s earnings were boosted by the Aerospace group, whose earnings increased at almost double the rate of sales in 2005, driven by continued strong demand for business jets. The growth was partly offset by program losses in the Marine Systems group during the year. The company’s margins increased to 10.4 percent in 2005 compared with 10.2 percent in 2004. Cash Flow The company’s cash flow from operating activities significantly exceeded net earnings in each of the past three years, continuing the company’s consistent record of generating substantial cash from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion in 2006 and 2005 and $1.8 billion in 2004. In addition, the company generated over $300 in cash in both 2006 and 2005 from the sale of several non-core businesses. Over the three-year period, the company used its cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase its common stock, pay dividends and reduce its outstanding debt. Other Financial Information General and administrative (G&A) expenses as a percentage of sales were 6.2 percent in 2006 and 2005, and 6.1 percent in 2004. G&A was $1.5 billion in 2006, $1.3 billion in 2005 and $1.2 billion in 2004. The company expects 2007 G&A as a percent of sales to approximate the 2006 rate. Net interest expense was $101 in 2006 compared with $118 in 2005 and $148 in 2004. The decrease in 2006 and 2005 resulted from interest income generated by the company’s strong cash position during the year. The company expects net interest expense of approximately $85 in 2007. The company’s effective tax rate was 32.3 percent in 2006, 30.0 percent in 2005 and 32.7 percent in 2004. In 2005, the company favorably resolved its 1999 to 2002 audit with the Internal Revenue Service. This settlement resulted in a $66 non-cash benefit, which reduced the company’s 2005 tax rate by 3.2 percent. The company anticipates an effective tax rate of approximately 32 to 33 percent in 2007, excluding the effect of potential settlements or other discrete events. For additional discussion of tax matters, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Discontinued Operations In 2006, General Dynamics completed the sale of its aggregates operation. The company received approximately $315 in cash from the sale of this business and recognized an after-tax gain of approximately $220 in discontinued operations. In addition, in 2006 the company initiated a process to sell its coal mining operation and recognized an estimated after-tax loss of approximately $40 in discontinued operations in connection with the anticipated sale. With the sale of the aggregates business and the expected sale of the coal business, the operations previously reported as Resources have been reclassified as discontinued operations. In 2004, as part of its efforts to focus on performance, General Dynamics identified a number of operations that were not core to the company and could be divested. As a result, the company completed the sale of several small businesses in the second half of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005. The company received approximately $300 in cash, net of income taxes, and reported an after-tax loss of $8 in 2005 from the sale of these businesses. The company’s reported net sales for all periods presented exclude the revenues associated with these divested businesses, and their operating results are included as discontinued operations, net of income taxes. For additional discussion of the company’s divestiture activities and the results of discontinued operations, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog General Dynamics’ total backlog increased 7 percent in 2006 to $43.7 billion at December 31. The funded backlog grew 21 percent, reaching $34 billion at year end. In 2006, the company received significant new orders in each of its business groups, totaling $26.5 billion, including a record level of order activity in the Aerospace group. General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report 21 Table of Contents The total backlog for the company’s defense businesses grew to $36 billion at the end of 2006, compared with $34.1 billion at year-end 2005. The defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog was $27.1 billion at December 31, 2006. This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. The unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, the company has included in backlog only those programs it believes are likely to receive funding. The Aerospace group’s total backlog reached a new high of $7.7 billion at December 31, 2006, up 16 percent over the year-end 2005 backlog of $6.6 billion (each excluding aircraft options). The Aerospace funded backlog, an indicator of near-term demand, grew 19 percent to $6.9 billion at the end of 2006 as orders continued at a record pace. The funded backlog represents orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. The Aerospace unfunded backlog of $752 at December 31, 2006, consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The company’s backlog does not include work awarded under indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft. IDIQ contracts are used when the customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed. These agreements, which set forth the majority of the contractual terms, including prices, are funded as delivery orders are placed. A significant portion of the company’s IDIQ value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the sole-source supplier to design, develop, produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies. Management believes the customers intend to fully implement these systems. However, because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer’s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders, the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. Contract options in the company’s defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts, if the customer exercises the option. These options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date. Contract options in the Aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft. The company recognizes unexercised options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. As of December 31, 2006, the potential value associated with these IDIQ contracts and contract options was approximately $13.1 billion, which may be realized over the next 15 years. This represents management’s estimate of potential value the company will receive. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower. REVIEW OF OPERATING SEGMENTS AEROSPACE Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 4,116 $ 3,433 $ 683 20 % Operating earnings 644 495 149 30 % Operating margin 15.6 % 14.4 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 113 89 Completion 104 84 The Aerospace group produced significant net sales growth in 2006 due largely to higher new aircraft deliveries to meet increased demand. In 2006, the group delivered 24 additional green aircraft, a 27 percent increase over 2005. Completions increased by 20 units, or 24 percent. A notable driver of the increased deliveries was the introduction of the mid-size G150 aircraft, which had 14 green deliveries and eight completions in 2006. Aircraft services volume also increased in 2006, while pre-owned aircraft sales were consistent with 2005. Of note, pre-owned aircraft deliveries as a percent of the group’s total unit deliveries declined to 9 percent in 2006 from 12 percent in 2005 and 16 percent in 2004, as more of the group’s customers chose to sell their pre-owned aircraft in the market rather than trading them in to the company. The group’s operating earnings and margins increased in 2006 as a result of the additional new aircraft volume and continued pricing improvements in all aircraft models. Improved margins on pre-owned aircraft sales also contributed to the earnings and margin growth in 2006. These increases in operating earnings were counteracted somewhat by a mix shift in the second half of the year that included proportionately more lower-margin, mid-size aircraft deliveries, as well as higher spending on research and development. The group’s resulting operating margins improved 120 basis points over 2005. 22 General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents The company expects substantial sales growth in the Aerospace group in 2007. The group is projecting 139 new aircraft deliveries in 2007, a 23 percent increase over 2006, and the 2007 production schedule is substantially sold out. Based on new-aircraft orders over the past two years, the group anticipates continued pricing improvements on units to be delivered in 2007. The company expects the effect of these pricing improvements and continued operational efficiencies to offset a further shift in aircraft mix toward mid-size aircraft and increasing product development spending. As a result, the company expects the group’s margins in 2007 to approximate those achieved in 2006. Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 3,433 $ 3,012 $ 421 14 % Operating earnings 495 393 102 26 % Operating margin 14.4 % 13.0 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 89 78 Completion 84 77 The Aerospace group’s net sales increased in 2005 because of higher new aircraft sales and increased aircraft services volume. Green aircraft deliveries were up 14 percent, and completions were up 9 percent. This growth was offset in part by lower pre-owned aircraft sales. Operating earnings and margins in 2005 grew significantly as a result of increased new aircraft volume, a more favorable mix of deliveries and improved pricing. Favorable cost performance in the aircraft services business and higher pre-owned aircraft earnings due to improved market conditions also contributed to the increase in earnings in 2005. Summary of Aircraft Statistical Information Sales contracts for new aircraft usually have two major milestones: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s completion, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics. The company records revenues at two points – when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The following table summarizes key unit data for the Aerospace group’s orders and backlog: Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 New orders 159 124 96 Options exercised — — 1 Firm orders 159 124 97 As of December 31 Firm contracts in backlog 203 207 175 Completions in backlog* 49 42 39 * Represents aircraft that have moved from green production to the completion process as of year end. The backlog includes only the value of the completion effort on these aircraft. Backlog The Aerospace group’s backlog grew 16 percent in 2006 to $7.7 billion at year end. The group’s funded backlog was $6.9 billion at December 31, 2006, up 19 percent over 2005. The funded backlog made up over 90 percent of the group’s total backlog. In 2006, the group received a record level of orders for the third consecutive year. New aircraft orders have increased nearly 30 percent in each of the past three years. For seven out of the eight quarters in 2005 and 2006, the group achieved a book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by sales) greater than one. New Aircraft Book-to-Bill Ratio 2004–2006* * Represents ratio of new aircraft orders to deliveries (in units) during the year. The group’s backlog includes scheduled aircraft deliveries through 2011. NetJets Inc. (NetJets), a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and the leader in the fractional aircraft market, is responsible for a significant portion of the group’s backlog. NetJets purchases the aircraft for use in its fractional ownership program. The group’s funded backlog at year end included approximately $700 with NetJets, representing firm contracts for 32 aircraft, including 15 green aircraft that are scheduled for delivery in 2007. The unfunded backlog included approximately $550 with NetJets for maintenance and support services. The group also has 28 aircraft options with NetJets. Due to the uncertainty and extended time frames associated with the large-quantity aircraft orders historically placed by NetJets, particularly for mid-size aircraft, the company has removed from the backlog a NetJets order for 50 G150 aircraft. General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report 23 Table of Contents The company has also removed options for 50 G150s and 50 G200s that had been included in the Aerospace group’s potential contract value. Deliveries of aircraft to NetJets are scheduled from 2007 through 2011 and represent from 3 percent to 10 percent of projected new aircraft sales in those years. Scheduled Deliveries of Aerospace Funded Backlog The group’s remaining $6.2 billion of funded backlog at year-end 2006 consisted of contracts with a broad range of customers from a variety of industries and included approximately $375 of contracts with government customers. COMBAT SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 5,983 $ 5,021 $ 962 19 % Operating earnings 677 576 101 18 % Operating margin 11.3 % 11.5 % The Combat Systems group generated substantial growth in net sales and operating earnings in 2006 compared with 2005. The group benefited from strong domestic and international demand for its combat vehicles and armaments and munitions products, due in part to ongoing U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Combat Systems’ operating margins were down slightly in 2006 because of a shift in mix from higher-margin products throughout the group, including the exit from commercial trading activities in the group’s European operations. The Stryker wheeled combat vehicle contract continued to be the group’s largest program, with total deliveries to date approaching 2,000 units. Stryker deliveries in 2006 included the Mobile Gun System and Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Reconnaissance vehicles, the final two of the 10 variants in the Stryker family of combat vehicles. The group also experienced higher activity on several other combat vehicle programs during 2006, including the Army’s Future Combat Systems (FCS) program and various domestic and international light armored vehicle (LAV) contracts. In particular, sales were up significantly in the group’s European business from volume that had been delayed on a number of vehicle production programs, including the Pandur II wheeled armored vehicle. High demand in the group’s armament business for systems that protect U.S. combat forces was also a strong contributor to the increased sales. In the group’s munitions business, a late-2005 award to provide small-caliber ammunition to the Army also made a significant contribution to the group’s growth in 2006. The group’s acquisition of Chamberlain Manufacturing Corporation’s Scranton operation (Scranton Operation) on July 7, 2006, contributed approximately 1 percent of the group’s sales growth over 2005. The Scranton Operation is a supplier of large-caliber projectile metal parts to the U.S. government. In January 2007, the group acquired SNC Technologies Inc. (SNC TEC), with operations in Quebec, Canada, from SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. SNC TEC is an ammunition systems integrator that supplies small-, medium- and large-caliber ammunition and related products to the Canadian Forces, other national defense customers and law enforcement agencies around the world. The company expects the Combat Systems group to experience sales growth in the low-double-digit range in 2007, including the effect of the SNC TEC acquisition. Operating margins in 2007 should improve somewhat over the 2006 margins. Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 5,021 $ 4,407 $ 614 14 % Operating earnings 576 522 54 10 % Operating margin 11.5 % 11.8 % The Combat Systems group produced solid growth in net sales and operating earnings in 2005. Higher production activity on the Stryker program was the largest contributor to this increase. Volume also increased on the M1A2 Abrams tank System Enhancement Package program, the Canadian RG-31 mine-protected personnel vehicle contract and the Saudi Arabian National Guard LAV contract. In the armaments and munitions businesses, demand increased in 2005 for reactive armor; systems that protect U.S. combat forces; and large-, medium- and small-caliber ammunition. These increases were offset in part by lower sales volume in the group’s European business stemming from delays in the timing of customer requirements and the completion of several international combat vehicle programs in 2004. 24 General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents Backlog The Combat Systems group generated $8.2 billion in new order activity in 2006. The group’s total backlog grew 28 percent to $12 billion at year-end 2006. Funded backlog increased 45 percent in 2006, reaching $10.1 billion at December 31. The group’s backlog consists primarily of long-term production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through 2014. The group’s backlog at December 31, 2006, included approximately $1.7 billion for the Army’s FCS program. The company is leading the system development of the Manned Ground Vehicle element of the program, as well as the development of the autonomous navigation systems for FCS ground vehicles. The company’s current contract extends through 2012. The Combat Systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately $1.2 billion for the Army’s Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program. In 2006, the group received orders under the Stryker program worth approximately $1.3 billion. These awards included approximately $750 for the production of 518 vehicles. The remainder of the awards in 2006 was for engineering and logistics support. In addition to the year-end backlog, the group was awarded a contract in January 2007 worth $145 for logistics support of the Stryker program. The M1 Abrams main battle tank also represents a significant portion of the group’s backlog. This includes both the M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP) and the M1A1 Abrams Integrated Management (AIM) programs. Under the SEP program, the company retrofits M1A2 Abrams main battle tanks with improved electronics, command-and-control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank’s effectiveness. The group’s backlog at year end included approximately $1.1 billion for the SEP program. In 2006, the group received orders valued at over $1 billion. These awards included approximately $515 to upgrade 240 M1A2 Abrams tanks to the SEP configuration and a contract worth approximately $425 to reset and upgrade 72 M1A2 Abrams tanks returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom and procure long-lead material needed to reset and upgrade an additional 240 tanks in the future. In 2006, the group received contracts valued at over $450 for the refurbishment of approximately 500 M1A1 tanks through the AIM process. The year-end backlog included approximately $550 for the AIM program. Under this program, M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks are completely overhauled and returned to a like-new condition. The group’s backlog at year end included approximately $225 for the Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program. The group is continuing the system design and development phase of the EFV program. Combat Systems also provides LAVs to the Marine Corps. The group was awarded a contract in 2006 worth over $300 to provide 151 eight-wheeled LAVs in various configurations. The vehicles are scheduled to be delivered in 2007 and 2008. Internationally, the group was awarded several significant combat vehicle contracts in 2006. The Belgian government selected the group’s Piranha wheeled armored vehicle for its Armored Infantry Vehicle program. The program calls for up to 242 vehicles and related logistics support and is worth approximately $600 if all options are exercised. The Czech Republic selected the group for a contract to produce 199 eight-wheeled Pandur II armored personnel carriers for the Czech army, for delivery between 2007 and 2012. The contract has an option for 35 additional vehicles and is worth up to $1 billion. The Combat Systems group has several other significant international, long-term combat vehicle production contracts in backlog. The group’s Leopard 2E program is a long-term battle tank manufacturing contract for the Spanish army using a design licensed from a German company. The group’s backlog at year end included approximately $400 for the production of 147 Leopard tanks, with deliveries scheduled through 2009. The group also produces Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles for the Spanish army. The backlog at the end of the year included approximately $660 for the production of 191 Pizarro vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2013. The group’s backlog at year end also included approximately $450 for a contract with the government of Portugal for 260 Pandur II vehicles. In 2006, the group received a contract worth approximately $370 from the Spanish army to supply long-range SPIKE missile systems. Under this contract, the company has been asked to manufacture 260 launchers and 2,600 missiles and provide related logistics support. In addition, the Combat Systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately $1.9 billion in armament, munitions, detection systems and composite-structures programs. In 2006, the Army awarded the group a $165 delivery order for the production of Hydra-70 (70mm) rockets, motors and warheads. The order is part of a five-year requirements contract with a total value received to date of over $330. Additionally, the group received a contract modification from the Army valued at approximately $190 for small-caliber ammunition. This award extended through 2007 a contract previously awarded in 2005 and increased the contract value to approximately $380. The contract has a total potential value of approximately $1.2 billion if all options are exercised. The Army also awarded the group a contract worth approximately $130 for the production of reactive armor tile sets for Bradley Fighting Vehicles and a contract with a potential value of $60 for Abrams reactive armor tile sets. General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report 25 Table of Contents MARINE SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 4,940 $ 4,695 $ 245 5 % Operating earnings 375 249 126 51 % Operating margin 7.6 % 5.3 % The Marine Systems group’s net sales increased in 2006 due primarily to an increase in volume on ship design and construction contracts for the U.S. Navy. Activity continued to increase in 2006 on the T-AKE combat logistics ship and Virginia-class submarine construction programs. In 2006, the company delivered the Lewis and Clark, the first ship under the current nine-ship T-AKE contract. Ships two through six are currently under construction. The Virginia-class program includes a four-ship cost-reimbursable “Block I” contract and a six-ship fixed-priced “Block II” contract. In 2006, the group delivered the Texas and the Hawaii, the second and third ships of the Block I contract. The fourth Block I ship is scheduled for delivery in 2008, and construction has begun on the first four ships of the Block II contract. The group also continued construction of its first Littoral Combat Ship and detail design of the DDG-1000 next-generation destroyer. The growth on these programs was offset in part by declining volume on the group’s contract to convert four ballistic-missile submarines to a conventional-strike configuration (SSGN) and its commercial tanker contract. The group returned to service the second and third SSGNs, the Florida and the Michigan, and completed the final commercial tanker in 2006. Marine Systems produced significant improvement in operating earnings in 2006, resulting in an increase in operating margins of 230 basis points over 2005. The most notable impact came from the group’s commercial tanker program and its submarine repair and overhaul business. In 2005, the group experienced $50 of cost growth on its contract to build four double-hull oil tankers, which negatively impacted operating earnings and margins. The final ship under this contract was delivered in 2006, two weeks ahead of schedule. Final settlement of the contract with the customer and efficiencies achieved in labor-hour performance on the completion of the contract generated positive earnings on the contract in 2006. The group also recorded losses on two submarine maintenance and overhaul contracts in 2005 totaling approximately $20. These losses resulted from customer-requested change orders that the group fulfilled prior to securing adequate contract protection. The group has implemented a more structured approach to managing customer change requirements, and the performance in the group’s overhaul and repair business improved significantly in 2006. Operating earnings and margins in 2006 also benefited from increased profitability on the group’s Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) destroyer construction program. In 2006, Marine Systems delivered the Farragut and the Gridley, the 26th and 27th ships of the class completed by the group. The group continues to generate significant labor-hour efficiencies and cost savings on the program, which includes delivery of seven more ships through 2011. The group experienced cost growth in 2005 on the Navy’s T-AKE program primarily from engineering- and design-related changes imposed by the customer. The company has submitted a formal request for equitable adjustment with the customer seeking approximately $600 of additional contract payments for the rework effort and scope growth caused by these changes. The Navy is evaluating the claim, and the company expects a resolution of this matter in 2007. The company is recording revenue at a break-even level based on the assumed recovery of a portion of this claim (see Note G to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The company expects sales in the Marine Systems group in 2007 to be similar to the 2006 volume, with improving margins as the Virginia-class, DDG-51 and T-AKE programs in particular continue to achieve efficiencies associated with program maturity and shipyard capital investments. Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 4,695 $ 4,726 $ (31 ) (1 )% Operating earnings 249 292 (43 ) (15 )% Operating margin 5.3 % 6.2 % In 2005, the Marine Systems group’s net sales were consistent with 2004. Higher volume on the Virginia-class submarine and T-AKE programs was offset by the completion of the Seawolf-class submarine program in 2004, lower activity on the group’s commercial tanker contract, and fewer repair and engineering contracts. Program losses in 2005 adversely affected the group’s operating earnings and margins. As previously discussed, the company recognized losses on its commercial tanker contract and two submarine maintenance and overhaul contracts in 2005, which depressed the group’s operating earnings and margins. Backlog 26 General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents The Marine Systems group’s backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as repair and engineering contracts. The group ended 2006 with a total backlog of $14 billion compared with $15.4 billion at year-end 2005. The group’s funded backlog was up 12 percent from $8.4 billion to $9.4 billion. The group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years. The current backlog includes shipbuilding programs through 2014. The backlog at year end included $7 billion for the Virginia-class submarine program, the group’s largest contract in backlog. The group has delivered three Virginia-class submarines, including two in 2006, and the backlog includes seven additional ships. Two submarines are scheduled for delivery in 2008, with one delivery per year beginning in 2010 for the remaining five ships under contract. The company is the prime contractor on the Virginia-class program, and construction is shared equally with its teaming partner. In 2006, the Navy awarded the group contract modifications worth over $2.6 billion that provide funding for the construction of the eighth and ninth submarines and advance procurement for the tenth ship. The group’s backlog at year end also included $1.4 billion for the construction of the remaining eight ships under contract under the Navy’s T-AKE program. The group delivered the lead ship of the T-AKE class in 2006. The Navy exercised an option in 2006 worth approximately $320 for the ninth T-AKE ship, bringing the total contract value to $2.8 billion. Deliveries of these ships are scheduled through 2010. Another significant component of the Marine Systems group’s backlog is the Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 destroyer program. At year-end 2006, the backlog included $1.8 billion for seven DDG destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2011. In parallel with the completion of the DDG-51 program, the Navy and industry are transitioning to construction of the next-generation guided-missile destroyer, the DDG-1000 Zumwalt Class, formerly known as DD(X). In 2006, the Navy awarded the group one of two contracts, valued at approximately $115, for the detail design of the ship. In January 2007, the Navy exercised an option worth $257 to complete the design effort for DDG-1000. In 2006, the company signed a contract worth $1 billion with U.S. Shipping Partners, L.P., for the construction of nine product-carrier tankers. The ships are scheduled for delivery between 2009 and 2014. The contract includes options for five additional ships, which will be added to the group’s backlog if exercised. Marine Systems leads one of two teams selected for the development and construction of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), the Navy’s newest class of high-speed surface combatants. The LCS is designed to operate in coastal areas against terrorist threats, high-speed swarm boats, mines and diesel submarines. In 2006, the Navy exercised an option worth $208 for the construction of a second LCS. The company’s first and second ships under the LCS program are scheduled for delivery in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The group’s backlog includes $135 for the SSGN program. Under this contract, the group is converting four Trident ballistic-missile submarines to an SSGN configuration, a multi-mission submarine optimized for tactical strike and special-operations support. The company delivered the second and third submarines under contract in 2006, and the conversion of the fourth submarine is scheduled for completion in 2007. In January 2007, the Navy awarded the group a seven-year contract for the maintenance and repair of LHA- and LHD-class amphibious assault ships. The contract has a potential value of $400, including options to extend the contract through 2013. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 9,024 $ 7,826 $ 1,198 15 % Operating earnings 976 865 111 13 % Operating margin 10.8 % 11.1 % The Information Systems and Technology group’s net sales and operating earnings increased in 2006, due largely to business acquisitions in 2005 and 2006. In 2006, the company acquired Anteon International Corporation (Anteon) and FC Business Systems, Inc. (FCBS), to expand the group’s information technology (IT) and mission services business. The company completed three smaller acquisitions in the group’s tactical communications systems business in 2005. In addition to acquisitions, the group experienced solid growth in its domestic IT services and tactical communications systems businesses, including the following key programs: • Intelligence Information, Command-and-Control Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2), which supports critical intelligence and command-and-control systems and networks for U.S. defense and intelligence operations worldwide; • Network-Centric Solutions (NETCENTS), which provides information technology, networking, and voice, video and data communications products and services to support the U.S. Air Force; • Common Hardware/Software III (CHS-3), which provides updated commercial and ruggedized computers, network equipment and software to the U.S. armed forces and other federal agencies worldwide; • Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP), which provides integrated mission systems for 28 state-of-the-art helicopters that are intended to replace Canada’s aging fleet of marine helicopters; and • Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), which enables on-the-move satellite connectivity for U.S. and allied forces. Increased demand for wireless network solutions for commercial wireless carriers also contributed to the group’s sales growth. General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report 27 Table of Contents The group’s sales growth in 2006 was tempered by the anticipated decline in activity on several programs, in particular the United Kingdom’s BOWMAN program and the Pentagon Renovation contract. BOWMAN is the secure digital voice and data communications system for the U.K. armed forces. In the second half of 2006, the BOWMAN program began transitioning from the production and installation phase to maintenance and long-term support activities. The group’s intelligence-systems business also experienced lower volume in 2006. The group’s resulting organic growth over 2005 was approximately 2 percent. In 2006, the group’s contract mix began to transition from a core holding of mature production programs to include more development-stage contracts, which typically carry lower margins and lower revenue levels. In addition, the group faced delays in some of its programs as the Defense Department shifted funds away from these contracts to support the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. These factors limited the group’s sales growth in 2006 and, when combined with the impact of lower margins contributed by recently acquired businesses, led to a slight decrease in the group’s operating margins for the year. In 2007, the company expects 7 to 8 percent sales growth for the group, with some reduction in operating margins as the group integrates the recent acquisitions and the shift in contract mix continues. Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 7,826 $ 6,722 $ 1,104 16 % Operating earnings 865 718 147 20 % Operating margin 11.1 % 10.7 % The group’s net sales and operating earnings improved substantially in 2005. The group experienced a significant increase in activity on its programs that provide secure communications and network systems to U.S. forces around the world, including ICE2, CHS-3, MUOS and the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) handheld/manpack/small form fit (HMS) radio. Internationally, the BOWMAN program and the MHP contract also contributed to the significant sales volume in 2005. Acquisitions in 2004 and 2005 contributed about 40 percent of the group’s 2005 sales growth. Operating margins in 2005 improved over 2004 due to the timing and mix of contract performance phases and customer deliveries, and cost savings achieved from the continued integration of acquired businesses. Backlog The Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog grew 6 percent in 2006 to $10 billion at year end. The group’s funded backlog increased 8 percent over 2005, reaching $7.5 billion. The group continued to generate significant order activity in 2006, achieving a book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by sales) greater than one for the fourth consecutive year. Unlike the company’s other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog consists primarily of a large number of mid-size contracts and programs, as well as several large-scale, long-term programs awarded over the past few years. Programs that made up a significant portion of the group’s year-end backlog included over $600 for the U.K.’s BOWMAN program, approximately $500 for the MHP contract, $515 for the MUOS program and $490 for ICE2. The group received over $650 in orders on the ICE2 program in 2006. In addition to these programs, the group received numerous significant contract awards in 2006. The Information Systems and Technology group was awarded one of two contracts to prepare a design and implementation plan for an initial service area of the Integrated Wireless Network (IWN). Following the design phase in 2007, the customer plans to select a single contractor to implement this system. IWN is a collaborative effort between the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and the Treasury intended to provide secure, seamless, interoperable and reliable nationwide wireless voice, data and multimedia communications among 80,000 federal agents and law enforcement officers engaged in disaster response, law enforcement, protective services and homeland defense. The group was awarded a contract extension in 2006 worth approximately $100 to continue its support of the U.S. Joint Forces Command’s Joint Experimentation Program and Joint Futures Lab, bringing the total contract value to over $275. Under this program, the group is providing engineering, technical and administrative services for joint force concept development. The Army awarded the group two contracts worth a combined $125 to support the Joint Network Node (JNN) program, bringing the total contract value to date to $380. Under JNN, the company is installing and deploying a tactical communications network for the Army. 28 General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents The group also received an order worth approximately $190 under its JTRS HMS radio development contract. Under the JTRS contract, the group is developing small, lightweight software-defined radios for use by all branches of the U.S. military. The Marine Corps awarded the group a contract valued at $230 for 165 Combat Operation Centers. These mobile command and control systems are intended to meet an urgent operational need for regiment- and battalion-level Marine Corps operations centers in Iraq. The group’s backlog does not include approximately $9.2 billion of potential contract value associated with IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. The value of these arrangements grew by over 35 percent in 2006 and may be realized over the next 15 years. In 2006, funding under IDIQ contracts contributed over $2.5 billion to the group’s funded backlog. The group was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2006, including one of 16 contracts from the Army to provide services under the Information Technology Enterprise Solutions–2 Services (ITES-2S) program. ITES-2S is an IDIQ contract with a $20 billion program ceiling and a nine-year performance period. Under the ITES-2S contract, the participating contractors will provide information technology services to the Army in support of its enterprise infrastructure goals. The Army selected the group for the first competitively awarded task order under the Total Engineering and Integration Services (TEIS) contract, an IDIQ multiple-award contract to provide IT engineering and technical support at customer sites worldwide. The TEIS contract has a ceiling value of approximately $800. The Department of Homeland Security awarded the group one of 25 IDIQ contracts under its Enterprise Acquisition Gateway for Leading Edge Solutions (EAGLE) program. This contract is for the procurement of IT services under four functional categories, including engineering design, development, implementation and integration; operations and maintenance; software development; and management support services. Information Systems and Technology was awarded one of six World-Wide Satellite Systems (WWSS) prime contracts to provide a family of military satellite communications terminals under a five-year IDIQ program worth up to $5 billion. The program is intended to support federal communications missions, including disaster relief and homeland security efforts. In addition, the group was awarded a prime contract under the Design Engineering Support Program II (DESP II), a multiple-award IDIQ contract with a total potential value of $1.9 billion over five years. This contract is for design and engineering technical support services for Department of Defense mission weapon systems, components and support equipment. CORPORATE Corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options and a portion of the earnings from the company’s commercial pension plans. In the second quarter of 2006, the company completed the sale of its aggregates business, as discussed in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the company has initiated a plan to sell its coal mining operation. With the sale of the aggregates business and the expected sale of the coal business, the operations previously reported as Resources have been reclassified to discontinued operations.

General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report 29 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In the mid-1990s, General Dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment, generating strong cash flow to enable a series of acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond its core platform businesses. These acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded the company’s customer base. Since 1995, the company has acquired 43 businesses for a total cost of over $16 billion. These actions have resulted in a larger, more diversified company, while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,128 $ 2,056 $ 1,803 Net cash used by investing activities (2,316 ) (181 ) (786 ) Net cash used by financing activities (539 ) (520 ) (902 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and equivalents (727 ) 1,355 115 Cash and equivalents at beginning of period 2,331 976 861 Cash and equivalents at end of period 1,604 2,331 976 Short- and long-term debt 2,781 3,287 3,293 Net debt (a) $ 1,177 $ 956 $ 2,317 Debt-to-equity (b) 28.3 % 40.4 % 45.8 % Debt-to-capital (c) 22.1 % 28.8 % 31.4 % (a) Net debt is calculated as total debt less cash and equivalents. (b) Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity. (c) Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total debt plus total equity. General Dynamics’ management emphasizes the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. In 2006, for the fourth consecutive year, net cash provided by operating activities significantly exceeded net earnings. The company employed this cash to complete acquisitions, continue its trend of annual dividend increases, repay maturing debt and repurchase its outstanding shares. As a result of this continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment, the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) increased by 70 basis points during 2006 to 15.6 percent and has increased 320 basis points since 2003. Return on Invested Capital Management believes ROIC is a useful measure for investors, because it reflects the company’s ability to generate returns from the capital it has deployed in its operations. The company uses ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. Management defines ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. ROIC for 2004 through 2006 is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Earnings from continuing operations $ 1,710 $ 1,448 $ 1,194 After-tax interest expense 106 108 106 After-tax amortization expense 90 70 62 Net operating profit after taxes 1,906 1,626 1,362 Average debt and equity 12,220 10,948 10,249 Return on invested capital 15.6 % 14.9 % 13.3 % The company’s free cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in 2006 and 2005, compared with $1.5 billion in 2004. Management defines free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays the company’s ability to generate cash from its core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing its common stock and paying dividends. The company uses free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of its earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 2,156 $ 2,033 $ 1,760 Capital expenditures (334 ) (262 ) (253 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 1,822 $ 1,771 $ 1,507 Cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations 126 % 140 % 147 % Free cash flow from operations 107 % 122 % 126 % 30 General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents Over the past ten years, the company has generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of its earnings from continuing operations during the period. With free cash flow from operations projected to approximate earnings from continuing operations in 2007, the company expects to continue to generate funds in excess of its short- and long-term liquidity needs. Management believes the company has adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute its financial and operating strategy. The following is a discussion of the company’s major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion in both 2006 and 2005 and $1.8 billion in 2004. In each year, net earnings was the primary driver of the company’s cash flow. Increasing levels of customer advances and deposits, particularly associated with new-aircraft order activity in the Aerospace group, also contributed to the strong cash provided by operating activities in each of these years. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to the company’s expectations, the default termination ultimately is sustained, the company and The Boeing Company could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006. If this were the outcome, the government contends the company would owe approximately $1.3 billion pretax. The company’s after-tax cash obligation would be approximately $665. The company believes it has sufficient resources to pay such an obligation, if required, while still retaining ample liquidity. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $2.3 billion in 2006, $181 in 2005 and $786 in 2004. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures. In 2006 and 2005, these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from divestiture activities. Business Acquisitions. In 2006, the company completed three acquisitions for a total of $2.3 billion. On January 17, the company acquired FC Business Systems, Inc., of Fairfax, Virginia. On June 8, the company acquired Anteon International Corporation (Anteon) of Fairfax, Virginia. As a condition of the Anteon acquisition, the company divested several of Anteon’s program management and engineering services contracts. The company received approximately $150 of after-tax proceeds from the sale of these contracts, resulting in a net purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion. On July 7, the company acquired Chamberlain Manufacturing Corporation’s Scranton, Pennsylvania, operation. In 2005, the company completed three acquisitions for a total of approximately $275. On April 1, the company acquired MAYA Viz Ltd. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On August 16, the company acquired Tadpole Computer, Inc., of Cupertino, California. On September 2, the company acquired Itronix Corporation of Spokane, Washington. In 2004, the company completed three acquisitions at a total cost of approximately $500. On July 9, the company acquired Spectrum Astro, Inc., of Gilbert, Arizona. On September 17, the company acquired TriPoint Global Communications Inc. of Newton, North Carolina. On November 1, the company acquired Engineering Technology Inc. of Orlando, Florida. The company financed these acquisitions using commercial paper and cash on hand. In January 2007, General Dynamics completed its acquisition of SNC Technologies Inc. for approximately $275. The company financed the transaction using cash on hand. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $334 in 2006, $262 in 2005 and $253 in 2004. The company expects capital expenditures of approximately $500 in 2007. The anticipated increase over 2006 relates to planned facility improvements at Gulfstream and in the Marine Systems group. The company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2006. Sale of Assets. In 2006, the company sold its aggregates business for approximately $315 in cash, after taxes. In 2005, the company completed the sales of several small, non-core businesses. The company received approximately $300 in cash, net of tax payments, from these divestiture activities. In 2004, the company sold two small, non-core businesses. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $539 in 2006, $520 in 2005 and $902 in 2004. The company’s typical financing activities are issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises. Debt Proceeds, Net. In 2006, the company repaid $500 of its fixed-rate debt on the scheduled maturity date. There were no material debt repayments in 2005. In 2004, the company repaid $500 of floating-rate notes on the scheduled maturity date. The company also made net repayments of commercial paper of $182 in 2004. The company had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The company has approximately $2 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon. These facilities are used to provide backup liquidity to the commercial paper program. The company does not have any significant scheduled debt repayments until 2008. General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report 31 Table of Contents Dividends. The company’s board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share in March 2006, the ninth consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share in March 2005 and to $0.18 per share in March 2004. Share Repurchases. In 2006, the company repurchased 1.2 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market at an average price of $63 per share. In 2005, the company repurchased 6.7 million shares at an average price of $54 per share. The company did not repurchase any shares during 2004. In June 2006, the company’s board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million shares of the company’s outstanding common stock on the open market. As of December 31, 2006, management was authorized to repurchase approximately 9.7 million shares – approximately 2 percent of the company’s total shares outstanding. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006, other than operating leases, the company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to the company’s stock and classified in shareholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; or variable interests in entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company or engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the company.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to long-term contracts and programs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers’ compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft inventory, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition–Government Contracts. The company accounts for sales and earnings under long-term government contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method, the company recognizes contract revenue as the work progresses – either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered, as applicable. The company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input (e.g., costs incurred) or output (e.g., units delivered) measures, as appropriate to the circumstances. The company follows the guidelines of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts, except that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, rather than the cumulative catch-up method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term, while under the cumulative catch-up method such impact would be recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified. Anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts, including G&A expenses. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications. Contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the timing of product deliveries. These estimates are based on the company’s best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company’s contracts. The company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method. The company recognizes revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, management considers the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. The company recognizes revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. Estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance. Business Aircraft. The company accounts for contracts for business-jet aircraft in accordance with Statement of Position 81-1. These contracts usually provide for two major milestones: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft (i.e., before exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics) and its completion. The company records revenue at two points: when green aircraft are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer. Pre-owned Aircraft Inventories. In connection with orders for new aircraft, the company routinely offers customers trade-in options. Under these options, if exercised, the company will accept trade-in aircraft at a predetermined price based on estimated fair value. It is the company’s policy to limit the Aerospace group’s investment in pre-owned aircraft inventory at any point in time to $200, unless specifically authorized. Once acquired in connection with a sale of new aircraft, the company records pre-owned aircraft at the lower of trade-in value or estimated net realizable value. The company treats any excess of the trade-in price above the net realizable value as a reduction of revenue upon the recording of the new aircraft sales transaction. General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report 33 Table of Contents The company also regularly assesses the carrying value of pre-owned aircraft in inventory and adjusts the carrying value to net realizable value when appropriate. The company determines net realizable value by using both internal and external aircraft valuation information. These valuations involve estimates and assumptions about many factors, including current market conditions, future market conditions, the age and condition of the aircraft and the availability of the aircraft in the market. These estimates are based on the company’s best judgment. Gross margins on sales of pre-owned aircraft can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of aircraft sold and current market conditions. Commitments and Contingencies. The company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of its business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. The company records a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when the company’s exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of the company’s government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of the company’s estimated workers’ compensation, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts when they are paid. As permitted by AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Federal Government Contractors, the company has elected to defer these costs in contracts in process until they are paid, at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government. The company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. This business base includes numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. The company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under the company’s contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on management’s best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of the company’s remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. The company’s defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. The company determines the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. The company determines the long-term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on the company’s best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, future pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the company’s commercial pension plans and post-retirement benefit plans would have had the following impact on 2006: Increase25 bps Decrease25 bps Increase (decrease) to net pension income from: Change in discount rate $ 2 $ (4 ) Change in long-term rate of return on plan assets 3 (3 ) Increase (decrease) to post-retirement benefit cost from: Change in discount rate $ (1 ) $ 1 Change in long-term rate of return on plan assets (1 ) 1 The company’s contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company’s government retirement plans. As permitted by AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Federal Government Contractors, the company has elected to defer recognition of the cumulative net unfunded benefit cost in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. As such, the company’s future earnings are not subject to the consequences of changes in the assumptions associated with these plans. Management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. New Accounting Standards In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by setting forth the required methodology for recognizing income tax contingencies in the financial statements. FIN 48 is effective in the first quarter of 2007. The company expects the adoption of FIN 48 to result in an immaterial reduction to its reserve for tax contingencies. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP. SFAS 157 also expands the required disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective in the first quarter of 2008. The company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 34 General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The company’s foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers, long-term debt and certain inter-company transactions denominated in currencies other than the company’s (or one of its subsidiaries’) functional currency. The company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to fix the amount of firmly committed and forecasted non-functional payments, receipts and inter-company transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities. These contracts are designed to minimize non-functional currency risks and/or risks associated with international subsidiaries that may enter into transactions outside of their own functional currency. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the company had $1.1 billion and $760, respectively, in notional contracts outstanding. A 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company’s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized pretax loss of $4 in 2006 and $5 in 2005, and an incremental unrealized pretax loss of $40 in 2006 and $26 in 2005. This exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rates. The company believes the realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. Financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations, variable-rate commercial paper and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2006, the company had only fixed-rate debt outstanding. The company’s fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable and are not traded by the company in the market. The company would be subject to interest rate risk from outstanding commercial paper, but there were no outstanding balances at year-end 2006 or 2005. The company’s investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of five years. As of December 31, 2006, the company held $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents to be used for general corporate purposes. Given the average weighted maturity of 11 days, a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings. Historically, the company has not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates. The company is also subject to risk of rising labor and commodity prices, primarily on long-term fixed-price contracts. To the extent possible, the company includes terms in its contracts that are designed to protect it from this risk. The company has not entered into commodity hedging contracts but may do so as circumstances warrant. Some of the protective terms included in the company’s contracts are considered derivatives but are not accounted for separately because they are clearly and closely related to the host contract. The company does not believe that changes in labor or commodity prices will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows.

40533,GD,GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP,2008,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (For an overview of the company’s business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW General Dynamics offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; shipbuilding design and construction; and information systems, technologies and services. The company operates through four business groups – Aerospace, Combat Systems, Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology. General Dynamics’ primary customers are the U.S. military, other U.S. government organizations, the armed forces of other nations, and a diverse base of corporate, government and individual buyers of business aircraft. The company operates in two primary markets: defense and business aviation. The majority of the company’s revenues derive from contracts with the U.S. military. 2007 Sales by Customer Base The nation’s engagement in the global war on terror, coupled with the need to modernize U.S. military forces, has driven steady Department of Defense funding increases since 2001. In particular, procurement and research and development (R&D) budgets, also known as investment accounts, provide the majority of the company’s revenues. These budget lines continue to enjoy sustained increases, demonstrating administration and congressional support. Defense Department funding has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 6.8 percent from fiscal 2001 through 2008, while procurement and R&D spending has grown nearly 8 percent annually during that period. For fiscal year 2008, the Congress appropriated $480 billion for the Department of Defense, including approximately $175 billion for procurement and R&D. Budget expenditures generally lag congressional funding, and the company expects that this 2008 funding will be applied toward programs over the next few years. For fiscal year 2009, the President has requested that the Congress appropriate $515 billion for the Department of Defense, a 7.5 percent increase over the 2008 funding. This includes $184 billion for procurement and R&D, an increase of 5 percent over 2008, representing more than one-third of the total 2009 budget request. During this period of war, defense budgets have included the President’s budget submission, as well as supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year to meet the emergent needs of the warfighter. For fiscal year 2008, the administration requested approximately $189 billion in supplemental funding, including approximately $75 billion, or 40 percent, for additional investment spending. The Congress has appropriated $87 billion of that request and will consider the remaining $102 billion in 2008. If this second supplemental is approved, defense funding for fiscal year 2008 will total approximately $670 billion, a 116 percent increase since 2001. While these supplemental funding requests have increased total defense spending levels, some military service accounts are under pressure as the services move funds among accounts to cover current war needs. In addition, supplemental appropriations do not include the level of program detail typically provided in general defense appropriations. These two factors have made it increasingly difficult to forecast the timing and amount of the impact of supplemental funding on the company’s programs. Looking ahead, the company expects the defense budget top line to remain well funded for the near term, led by the need to continue to support the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. While the landscape will continue to evolve during this dynamic period, the company expects near-term defense funding to be driven primarily by the following: • continued support for the warfighter from the administration and the Congress in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment; • the number of troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, coupled with the increase in the overall size of the U.S. military; • the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed during the war; and • the need to modernize the country’s military infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern-day warfare. Based on the recently approved and proposed defense budgets, the company expects the levels of funding available for its programs will likely continue to grow in 2008 and 2009. Defense Funding 2001–2009 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report 19 Table of Contents Beyond the company’s U.S. defense market, governments around the world are increasingly funding weapons and equipment modernization programs, leading to expanding defense export opportunities. The company is committed to pursuing international opportunities presented by foreign demand for military hardware and information technologies. While the revenue upside can be significant, European and other foreign defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing, defense priorities and overall fiscal spending pressures. As General Dynamics broadens the customer base for its defense products around the world, the company expects growing international sales. The business-aviation market also continues to expand, and 2007 was another strong year. Despite the recent uncertainty in the U.S. macroeconomic environment, the Aerospace group’s North American and international order activity remains robust. Following seven consecutive quarters with a book-to-bill ratio exceeding one, the Aerospace’s record backlog extends through 2011 for large-cabin models. At this juncture, management has not observed any indications of backlog weakness such as cancellations, financing issues or requests to delay delivery. The company expects continued growth in the business-jet market, stemming from its strong products in the long-range and ultra-long-range markets, and robust sales of the company’s mid-size products. In particular, the market for the company’s business jets outside the United States has demonstrated powerful growth. In 2007, for the first time in the company’s history, Gulfstream received more than 50 percent of its aircraft orders from outside North America. Of note, the European and Asian markets comprised more than one-third of the group’s orders in 2007, and demand remains strong. General Dynamics’ management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices, disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements. The company’s solid performance over the past 10 years is measured in its sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow. General Dynamics’ record as an industry leader in cash flow generation has provided the company’s management the flexibility to execute its operational strategy, and enabled it to consistently deploy resources to further enhance shareholder returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchases. CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW The following discussion of the company’s results of operations is based on operating performance at the business group level. The disclosures focus on the material financial measures the company’s management uses to evaluate the performance of each of its four business groups, including sales, operating earnings and margins, and backlog. For the defense business groups, the discussion of results of operations is based on specific contracts and programs that drive the group’s results rather than types of products and services, which often comprise multiple contracts with different customers. For the Aerospace group, the results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services, consistent with how the group is managed. In the defense business groups, the majority of the sales are generated by long-term government contracts. As discussed further in the critical accounting policies section, the company accounts for sales under these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this method, revenue is recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered, as applicable. As a result, changes in sales are generally discussed in terms of volume. Volume indicates increases or decreases in sales due to changes in production or construction activity levels, changes in delivery schedules or levels of services on individual contracts. In the Aerospace group, sales contracts for new aircraft typically have two major phases: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s completion, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics. The company records revenues at two milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. Changes in sales in this group result from the amount of new aircraft deliveries (both green and completion), the level of service activity during the period and the number of pre-owned aircraft sold. Operating earnings and margins in the defense business groups are generally discussed in terms of changes in sales volume, performance, or the mix of contracts and the phases of work within those contracts (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable, development/production). Performance 20 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report Table of Contents refers to changes in contract earnings rates during the term of the contract based on revisions to estimates of profit at completion on individual contracts. These revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract and/or the estimated costs required to complete the contract. The following discussion of results provides additional disclosure to the extent that a material or unusual event causes a change in the profitability of a contract. Operating earnings and margins in the Aerospace group are generally a function of the prices the company is able to charge for its various aircraft models, the operational efficiency of the group in the manufacture and completion of the aircraft, and the mix of aircraft deliveries among the higher-margin large-cabin and lower-margin mid-size aircraft. Additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margins include the number and type of pre-owned aircraft sold and the level of general and administrative costs incurred by the group, which include selling expenses and research and development costs. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 27,240 $ 24,063 $ 3,177 13.2 % Operating earnings 3,113 2,625 488 18.6 % Operating margin 11.4 % 10.9 % General Dynamics generated strong results in 2007 compared with 2006, ending the year with the highest sales, operating earnings, net earnings, cash flow from operations, orders and backlog in the company’s history. The company produced solid sales growth in 2007 on the strength of rising sales in each of the company’s business groups. In particular, the Combat Systems and Aerospace groups generated the most substantial sales growth in 2007 due to strong worldwide demand for military vehicles and business-jet aircraft. Sales in the Information Systems and Technology group increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of Anteon International Corporation in 2006, as organic growth in the group’s North American market was largely offset by a scheduled reduction in sales in the United Kingdom. Sales were up slightly in the Marine Systems group compared with 2006. The company’s operating earnings grew at a higher rate than sales in 2007, the result of significant operating leverage achieved in three of the company’s four business groups. The Aerospace group’s margins improved 120 basis points on the strength of improved pricing and ongoing productivity improvements. Margins in the Combat Systems and Marine Systems groups were up 40 basis points and 80 basis points, respectively, due to improving operational execution. Overall, the company’s operating margins increased 50 basis points for the second year in a row to 11.4 percent in 2007. The company’s continued focus on operations has generated four consecutive years of operating margin expansion and a total 260 basis-point improvement in margins over the past five years. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 24,063 $ 20,975 $ 3,088 14.7 % Operating earnings 2,625 2,179 446 20.5 % Operating margin 10.9 % 10.4 % The company’s sales and operating earnings increased significantly in 2006. Increased new aircraft deliveries in the Aerospace group, strong demand for combat vehicles and armament and munitions products in the Combat Systems group, and acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology group were the most significant drivers of the increase in sales. Each of the company’s four business groups generated double-digit earnings growth in 2006. In particular, the Marine Systems group’s operating earnings grew over 50 percent due to significantly improved performance on its ship construction programs. The Aerospace group’s earnings also increased substantially on strong new aircraft volume and improved pricing on units delivered in 2006 compared with 2005 deliveries. The improved performance resulted in an overall increase in the company’s operating margins from 10.4 percent in 2005 to 10.9 percent in 2006. Cash Flow The company produced significant cash flows from operations in 2007, generating cash from operations in excess of net earnings for the ninth consecutive year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion in 2007 and $2.1 billion in each of 2006 and 2005. In addition, the company generated over $300 in cash in both 2006 and 2005 from the sale of several non-core businesses. Over the three-year period, the company used its cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase its common stock, pay dividends and reduce its outstanding debt. The company’s net debt – debt less cash and equivalents and short-term investments – was a net surplus of $268 at the end of 2007 compared with net debt of $1.2 billion at the end of 2006. The company achieved this reduction after giving effect to $330 spent on acquisitions, over $500 of share repurchases, $430 of company-sponsored research and development, almost $475 of capital expenditures and $445 of dividends paid during the year. Other Financial Information General and administrative (G&A) expenses as a percentage of sales were 6.0 percent in 2007, and 6.2 percent in each of 2006 and 2005. G&A was $1.6 billion in 2007, $1.5 billion in 2006 and $1.3 billion in 2005. The company expects 2008 G&A as a percent of sales to approximate the 2007 rate. Net interest expense was $70 in 2007 compared with $101 in 2006 and $118 in 2005. Interest income generated by the company’s strong cash position has increased during each of the past three years while scheduled repayments of the company’s long-term debt have steadily reduced interest expense. The company expects net interest expense of approximately $10 to $15 in 2008 based on the company’s substantial balance of invested cash. General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report 21 Table of Contents The company’s effective tax rate was 31.7 percent in 2007, 32.3 percent in 2006 and 30.0 percent in 2005. The company’s effective tax rate in 2007 was impacted favorably by the resolution of the company’s 2003 to 2004 federal income tax audit with the Internal Revenue Service. This settlement resulted in a benefit of $18, or approximately $0.04 per share, which reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 60 basis points. In 2005, the company favorably resolved its 1999 to 2002 federal income tax audit. This settlement resulted in a $66 benefit, or approximately $0.16 per share, which reduced the company’s 2005 tax rate by 320 basis points. The company anticipates an effective tax rate of approximately 32.5 percent in 2008 excluding the potential resolution of tax matters related to prior years or other discrete events that may occur in the future. For additional discussion of tax matters, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Discontinued Operations In 2007, General Dynamics completed the sale of its coal mining operation and received proceeds of approximately $25. The company had previously recognized an after-tax loss of $37 in discontinued operations in 2006 in anticipation of the sale. In 2006, the company completed the sale of its aggregates operation. The company received approximately $315 in cash from the sale of this business and recognized an after-tax gain of $220 in discontinued operations. In 2005, General Dynamics completed the sale of several small businesses that were not core to the company. The company received approximately $300 in cash, net of income taxes, and reported an after-tax loss of $8 in 2005 from the sale of these businesses. The company’s reported net sales for all periods presented exclude the revenues associated with these divested businesses, and their operating results are included as discontinued operations, net of income taxes. For additional discussion of the company’s divestiture activities and the results of discontinued operations, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog General Dynamics’ total backlog was $46.8 billion at year end, up 7 percent from $43.7 billion at the end of 2006. Funded backlog increased 9 percent in 2007 to $37.2 billion compared with $34 billion at year-end 2006. The company generated total new orders of $29.5 billion in 2007, representing significant order activity across each of the company’s business groups during the year. The total backlog for the company’s defense businesses decreased 4 percent to $34.6 billion at year-end 2007, compared with $36 billion at the end of 2006. The defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog was $25.6 billion at the end of 2007. This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. The unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders that do not meet these criteria. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, the company has included in the backlog only firm contracts it believes are likely to receive funding. The Aerospace group’s total backlog increased $4.6 billion or 59 percent in 2007, reaching a new high of $12.3 billion at year end. The group received a record number of orders during the year, resulting in funded backlog of $11.6 billion at the end of 2007, up 67 percent over 2006. The funded backlog represents orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. The Aerospace unfunded backlog of $665 at year-end 2007 consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The company’s backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft. IDIQ contracts are used when the customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed. These agreements, which set forth the majority of the contractual terms, including prices, are funded as delivery orders are placed. A significant portion of the company’s IDIQ value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the sole-source supplier to design, develop, produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies. Management believes the customers intend to fully implement these systems. However, because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer’s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders, the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. Contract options in the company’s defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts, if the customer exercises the option. These options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date. Contract options in the Aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft. The company recognizes options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. 22 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report Table of Contents As of December 31, 2007, the potential value associated with these IDIQ contracts and contract options was approximately $14.5 billion, up from $13.1 billion at the end of 2006. The company expects to realize this value over the next 15 years. This represents management’s estimate of the potential value the company will receive. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower. REVIEW OF OPERATING SEGMENTS AEROSPACE Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 4,828 $ 4,116 $ 712 17.3 % Operating earnings 810 644 166 25.8 % Operating margin 16.8 % 15.6 % Aircraft deliveries (in units) : Green 138 113 Completion 138 104 The Aerospace group continued its strong performance in 2007 as sales and operating earnings increased significantly over 2006. Growing global demand for business jets has led to successive years of significant order activity and resulting substantial growth in the group’s backlog. To meet this demand, the group has steadily increased its aircraft production rate and delivery schedule. As a result, new aircraft sales grew 22 percent in 2007, including a 22 percent increase in green aircraft deliveries and a 33 percent increase in completions. In addition, aircraft services volume increased by 20 percent over 2006, reflecting the growing global installed base of business-jet aircraft. Pre-owned aircraft activity declined significantly in 2007 as increasing numbers of customers chose to sell their own aircraft rather than trade them. Sales of pre-owned aircraft were $78 in 2007 compared with $217 in 2006. The Aerospace group’s operating earnings and margins increased substantially in 2007 compared with 2006. Operating earnings were up approximately $205 as a result of the increased new-aircraft and aircraft-services volume. Improved pricing on units delivered in 2007 compared with 2006 deliveries, combined with labor efficiencies and productivity improvements particularly in the completion process, contributed another $65 of earnings growth. Increased selling costs associated with the year’s substantial order activity, higher product-development spending and increased G&A costs reduced the group’s earnings growth by about $90. Reduced sales of pre-owned aircraft lowered the earnings growth by $14. The operating leverage achieved by the group, offset in part by a mix shift to include proportionately more lower-margin mid-size aircraft deliveries, resulted in a 150 basis-point increase in new-aircraft margins over 2006. Aircraft services margins were up 50 basis points over 2006. Overall, the Aerospace group produced a 120 basis-point increase in margins for the second consecutive year. The company expects to deliver 157 new aircraft in 2008, an increase of 14 percent over 2007. Based on this projected increase in deliveries, the company expects the Aerospace group’s sales will grow between 13 and 15 percent in 2008. Combining the improved pricing in the 2008 scheduled deliveries with increased spending on research and development, the company expects the group’s operating margins to be 20 to 40 basis points higher than those achieved in 2007. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 4,116 $ 3,433 $ 683 19.9 % Operating earnings 644 495 149 30.1 % Operating margin 15.6 % 14.4 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 113 89 Completion 104 84 The Aerospace group’s sales growth in 2006 was due largely to higher new aircraft deliveries. New aircraft sales increased 22 percent in 2006 over 2005. Green deliveries were up 27 percent while aircraft completions were up 24 percent. The group introduced the mid-size G150 aircraft in 2006, which added 14 green deliveries and eight completions. Aircraft services sales increased 15 percent in 2006, while pre-owned aircraft sales remained steady compared to 2005. Operating earnings in 2006 increased approximately $150 as a result of higher new aircraft volume. Pricing improvements on all aircraft models overcame a shift in the mix of deliveries in the second half of the year toward proportionately more mid-size aircraft deliveries to contribute an additional $25 of operating earnings. Improved margins on pre-owned aircraft sales increased operating earnings by $7 while higher product development spending and selling costs reduced the operating earnings growth by $33. Backlog The Aerospace group’s backlog was $12.3 billion at the end of 2007, an increase of 59 percent over 2006. The group’s funded backlog grew 67 percent in 2007 to $11.6 billion at year end. The group received a record level of orders for the fourth consecutive year, and after increasing General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report 23 Table of Contents nearly 30 percent each year from 2004 through 2006, new orders grew over 60 percent in 2007. The group has achieved a book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by sales) greater than one for the past seven consecutive quarters. New Aircraft Book-to-Bill Ratio 2005–2007* * Represents ratio of new aircraft orders to deliveries (in units) during the year.

The group’s order profile in 2007 reflected continued strong activity in the North American market as well as rising demand around the world, which resulted in a shift to include over 50 percent of orders in the year from customers outside North America for the first time. The group’s backlog includes scheduled aircraft deliveries through 2011. COMBAT SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 7,797 $ 5,983 $ 1,814 30.3 % Operating earnings 916 677 239 35.3 % Operating margin 11.7 % 11.3 % Among the company’s four business groups, Combat Systems experienced the greatest growth in sales and operating earnings in 2007 and in the fourth quarter generated the highest quarterly sales and operating earnings of any segment in the company’s history. This strong performance resulted from continued growth across all of the group’s product lines, with particularly strong growth in the company’s military vehicle markets worldwide. As a result, each of the group’s businesses experienced double-digit sales and earnings increases in 2007. Over half of the growth resulted from increased volume in the group’s U.S. military vehicle business, including core programs as well as adjacent market opportunities. The ongoing U.S. presence in Iraq and Afghanistan and the military’s need to reset and repair vehicles damaged in military operations continued to generate strong demand for the group’s combat vehicles and related services. Sales increased 31 percent in this business in 2007 compared with 2006, driven by the following primary contributors: • the company’s ongoing Abrams main battle tank modernization work; • activity on the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program; • the ramp-up of production of light armored vehicles (LAVs) for the U.S. Marine Corps; and • the production of military vehicles under the mine-resistant, ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicle program. The group supports the M1 Abrams tank by providing upgrades, including the Abrams Integrated Management (AIM), the System Enhancement Package (SEP) and the Tank Urban Survivability Kit (TUSK). Stryker continued to be the group’s largest program in 2007, with volume up most significantly on contractor logistics support activity. MRAP emerged as a high-priority acquisition program for the Marine Corps and Army during 2007. The group’s munitions business also contributed significantly to the group’s sales and earnings in 2007. Sales were up almost 50 percent in this business in 2007 compared with 2006. The munitions business generated approximately 15 percent organic sales growth, with particularly strong volume in its large- and medium-caliber munitions supply contracts. The remainder of the increase in sales resulted from the acquisition of SNC Technologies Inc. (SNC TEC) from SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., in January 2007. SNC TEC is an ammunition systems integrator that supplies small-, medium- and large-caliber ammunition and related products to the Canadian Forces, U.S. and other national defense customers and law enforcement agencies around the world. Sales in the group’s weapons systems business grew 13 percent in 2007 due primarily to increased activity on a contract to produce systems that protect U.S. combat forces from improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The group’s European military vehicle business experienced sales growth of almost 30 percent in 2007. Increased activity on various programs to produce military vehicles for non-U.S. governments was the most significant factor in the increased sales. In particular, volume was up in 2007 on the Pandur II wheeled vehicle contracts for Portugal and the Czech Republic and the Piranha wheeled armored vehicle programs for several European governments. In December 2007, the Czech Republic cancelled the company’s contract for 199 vehicles. The company is in discussions with the Czech Republic about a contract for a reduced quantity. While these 24 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report Table of Contents discussions may result in an overall reduction in the size of the Czech Pandur contract, the company does not believe the outcome of the negotiations will have a material effect on the group’s operating results. The Combat Systems group’s operating margins improved 40 basis points in 2007 compared with the margins achieved by the group in 2006. Margins increased due to a shift in contract mix and improved performance across a number of the group’s wheeled military vehicle programs. The improvement in the group’s margins was limited somewhat by the inclusion of lower-margin acquisitions in the munitions business, increased supplier costs on the group’s small-caliber munitions contract and costs recognized in connection with the company’s exit from the group’s European commercial trading business. The company expects 2008 sales growth in the Combat Systems group in the 9 to 10 percent range based on the group’s substantial backlog, with operating margins improving 30 to 50 basis points over the 2007 margins. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 5,983 $ 5,021 $ 962 19.2 % Operating earnings 677 576 101 17.5 % Operating margin 11.3 % 11.5 % The Combat Systems group’s sales and operating earnings increased substantially in 2006 over 2005. Sales in the group’s U.S. and European military vehicle businesses were up 17 percent due to higher production activity on the Stryker program and several European military vehicle contracts. Activity also increased on the Army’s Future Combat Systems (FCS) development program and various domestic and international LAV contracts. The group’s weapons systems and munitions businesses generated a 24 percent increase in sales in 2006 compared with 2005. High demand for protection systems for U.S. forces and increased volume on a contract to provide small-caliber ammunition to the Army contributed to the growth in these businesses in 2006. The group’s acquisition of Chamberlain Manufacturing Corporation’s Scranton operation in 2006 contributed approximately 1 percent of the group’s total 2006 sales growth. Backlog The Combat Systems group ended 2007 with a total backlog of $12.9 billion, an increase of 8 percent over 2006. Funded backlog grew 7 percent to $10.8 billion. The group’s backlog consists primarily of long-term production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through 2014. The group’s backlog at December 31, 2007, included over $2.8 billion for contracts related to the M1 Abrams main battle tank. This includes both the M1A2 SEP and the M1A1 AIM programs. Under the SEP program, the company retrofits M1A2 Abrams main battle tanks with improved electronics, command-and-control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank’s effectiveness. Under the AIM program, M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks are completely overhauled and returned to a like-new condition. At year end, the backlog included approximately $1.5 billion for the SEP program and close to $400 for AIM. During 2007, the company received awards totaling over $750 for the SEP program to upgrade and reset approximately 340 vehicles and for related program support. The group also received an order from the Army in 2007 worth over $300 under the Egyptian M1A1 Abrams tank co-production program to supply 125 tank kits for assembly in Egypt. In February 2008, the group received a multiyear contract from the Army to upgrade 435 Abrams tanks to the M1A2 SEP V2 configuration. The first increment of the contract, for 20 tanks, is valued at $39. The largest single contract in the group’s backlog at December 31, 2007, is the Army’s FCS program. The backlog at year end included approximately $1.5 billion for FCS. The company leads the system development of the manned ground vehicle element of the program, as well as the development of the autonomous navigation systems for FCS ground vehicles. The company’s current contract extends through 2012. The Combat Systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately $1 billion for the Army’s Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program. The backlog includes the production of over 400 vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2009. In 2007, the group received orders under the Stryker program totaling $1.2 billion, including awards worth approximately $335 for the production of approximately 220 vehicles. The group also received total awards of over $500 in 2007 for Stryker contractor logistics support. The group’s backlog under the MRAP program totaled $570 at year end. The group is producing two separate vehicles under this program – the Cougar, in connection with a joint venture, and the RG-31. During 2007, the group was awarded a total of $575 for approximately 1,190 Cougar vehicles and $350 for 620 RG-31 MRAP vehicles. The year-end backlog represents approximately 720 Cougar vehicles and 450 RG-31 vehicles. In the first quarter of 2008, the company received, and added to the backlog, orders valued at approximately $150 for an additional 183 Cougar vehicles and related logistics and spares. The company expects to complete its deliveries under this program in the first half of 2008. The Combat Systems group has several significant international, long-term combat vehicle production contracts in backlog. The group’s Leopard 2E program is a battle tank manufacturing contract for the Spanish army using a design licensed from a German company. The group’s backlog at year end included approximately $550 for the production of General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report 25 Table of Contents 119 Leopard tanks, with deliveries scheduled through 2010. The group also produces Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles for the Spanish army. The backlog at the end of the year included approximately $650 for the production of 190 Pizarro vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2014. The group’s year-end backlog also included approximately $370 for a contract with the government of Portugal for 251 Pandur II vehicles, $360 for a contract with the government of Belgium for 138 Piranha wheeled armored vehicles and $675 under the original contract with the Czech Republic for approximately 135 Pandur II vehicles. The company is in negotiations with the customer regarding the Czech contract, which may result in a reduced number of vehicles to be delivered. In addition, the group was awarded a contract valued at approximately $85 in 2007 to provide 21 Piranha IIIC 8x8 amphibious armored personnel carriers to the Spanish marines for delivery between 2009 and 2013. The Combat Systems group’s backlog at year end also included approximately $2.3 billion in weapons systems, munitions, detection systems and composite-structures programs. The group received an order from the Army in 2007 worth approximately $150 for the production of Hydra-70 (2.75 inch) rockets. The total contract value to date is over $500. Additionally, the Army awarded the group a contract worth over $100 for the production of reactive armor for the Bradley Fighting vehicle. MARINE SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 4,993 $ 4,940 $ 53 1.1 % Operating earnings 421 375 46 12.3 % Operating margin 8.4 % 7.6 % The Marine Systems group’s sales were up slightly in 2007 compared with 2006. Approximately 60 percent of the group’s sales in 2007 and 2006 were generated by three of the group’s mature ship-construction programs for the U.S. Navy – the Virginia-class submarine, the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) destroyer and the T-AKE combat-logistics ship. Combined sales from these core programs in 2007 were essentially unchanged compared with 2006. In 2007, the group delivered ships two through four of the current 10-ship T-AKE program to the Navy, driving volume up significantly, while activity on the Virginia-class and the DDG-51 destroyer programs declined during the year. The Virginia-class program volume was down slightly due to workload timing. The company expects to deliver the fourth and final ship of the cost-reimbursable Virginia Block I contract in the first quarter of 2008, and construction is in process on five of the six ships under the fixed-price Block II contract. Deliveries under Block II are scheduled through 2013. Volume on the destroyer program began to decline in 2007 as the group continued construction of the remaining six ships under contract. Deliveries are scheduled through 2011, including two in 2008. Beyond these large construction programs, volume was up across the group’s ship design, engineering, repair and overhaul, and early-stage construction programs in process for the Navy. These include the detail design of the DDG-1000 next-generation destroyer and the construction of the first Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). Volume on these two programs increased over 60 percent in 2007 compared with 2006. The company’s LCS was approximately 65 percent complete at year end. Additionally, activity was up over 10 percent on the group’s engineering, repair and overhaul contracts for the Navy in 2007, particularly in the group’s nuclear submarine support and logistics services business. Volume decreased in 2007 on the group’s SSGN submarine conversion program and commercial ship construction programs. The group completed its fourth and final SSGN submarine conversion in 2007. Marine Systems’ commercial shipbuilding activity was down in 2007 due to the completion of the group’s four-ship commercial tanker program in 2006. Construction of the first two of nine ships under the group’s product-carrier contract has just begun. Overall, combined sales for the SSGN program and the commercial shipbuilding contracts decreased over 50 percent in 2007. The Marine Systems group’s operating earnings and margins grew significantly in 2007 on steady sales. The group has generated operating efficiencies that led to improved performance on several of its key programs. Most notably, the Virginia-class submarine, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer and the SSGN submarine conversion programs experienced significant performance improvements during the year. Additionally, the company and the Navy reached an agreement in 2007 to restructure the T-AKE contract. The agreement included a resolution of the company’s outstanding request for equitable adjustment (REA), which resulted in revised pricing on ships one through nine and the addition of five option ships. The Navy exercised the option for the 10th ship in January 2008. Prior to the agreement, the company was recognizing revenue on the T-AKE program at a break-even level pending the resolution of the REA. After the contract restructuring, the estimate at completion for the program was revised and the company began recognizing profit on the contract in the second quarter of 2007. As a result of the improved performance on these programs, the group’s overall margins increased 80 basis points in 2007 compared with 2006. The company expects sales in the Marine Systems group to increase between 3 and 4 percent in 2008 with margins improving an additional 10 to 20 basis points over 2007. The company expects the group’s margins to benefit from continued performance improvements in its ship construction programs but to be constrained by a shift in mix away from the later-stage production contracts toward early-stage design and construction work. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 4,940 $ 4,695 $ 245 5.2 % Operating earnings 375 249 126 50.6 % Operating margin 7.6 % 5.3 % 26 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report Table of Contents The Marine Systems group’s sales increased in 2006 due primarily to a 20 percent increase in volume on ship design and construction contracts for the Navy. In particular, activity was up in 2006 on the T-AKE contract, the Virginia-class submarine program and the LCS program. The group also began the detail design of the DDG-1000 next-generation destroyer in 2006. Offsetting this growth was a scheduled decline in activity on the SSGN submarine conversion program and the completion of the group’s four-ship commercial tanker program in 2006. The group’s operating earnings improved substantially in 2006, and operating margins grew 230 basis points over 2005. Program losses in 2005 on the commercial tanker contract and in the group’s submarine maintenance and overhaul business adversely affected the group’s operating earnings and margins during that year. Operating earnings and margins in 2006 were favorably impacted by the absence of additional losses on these programs and by improved performance due to labor-hour efficiencies and cost savings on the DDG-51 destroyer construction program. Backlog The Marine Systems group’s backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as numerous repair and engineering contracts. The group’s total backlog at year-end 2007 was $12.1 billion compared with $14 billion at the end of 2006. The group’s funded backlog at December 31 was $7.6 billion, down from $9.4 billion at year-end 2006. The group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years. The current backlog includes shipbuilding deliveries through 2013. The largest program in the Marine Systems group’s backlog is the Virginia-class submarine program. The group’s backlog at year end included $5.5 billion for seven Virginia-class submarines to be delivered through 2013. As the prime contractor on the Virginia-class program, the company reports the entire backlog and sales associated with the program but shares the construction and the earnings equally with its teaming partner. In 2007, Marine Systems received a $270 contract to procure long-lead materials for the first ship of the next (Block III) contract. The Virginia-class program of record is scheduled to include 30 submarines, and the company expects to finalize negotiations of the Block III contract by the end of 2008. The group’s backlog at the end of 2007 also included $1.3 billion for the Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 destroyer program. The backlog includes six DDG destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2011, including two in 2008. In parallel with the completion of the DDG-51 program, the Navy and industry are transitioning to construction of the next-generation guided-missile destroyer, the DDG-1000 Zumwalt Class. The group has one of two contracts for the detail design of the ship, and in 2007, the group received awards totaling approximately $700 from the Navy to complete the design effort and procure long-lead materials for the first ship. The group’s backlog at year-end 2007 included over $600 for DDG-1000. In February 2008, the Navy awarded the group a contract worth $1.4 billion for the construction of the first DDG-1000, with delivery scheduled in 2014. A significant portion of the group’s backlog is for the T-AKE combat-logistics ship program. The group’s backlog at December 31, 2007, included $1.1 billion for the construction of the remaining five ships under the original nine-ship program. In 2007, the Navy awarded the group a contract modification worth $100 to purchase long-lead materials for the 10th ship, and in January 2008, the Navy exercised a $360 option for the 10th ship and awarded a $100 modification for long-lead materials for the 11th ship. Deliveries of these ships are scheduled through 2010. The group’s backlog at year end also included $1.1 billion for a contract with U.S. Shipping Partners, L.P., for the construction of nine Jones Act product-carrier tankers. The ships are scheduled for delivery between 2009 and 2013. In addition, the Marine Systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately $1.9 billion in engineering, repair and overhaul programs. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 9,622 $ 9,024 $ 598 6.6 % Operating earnings 1,027 976 51 5.2 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.8 % Sales in the Information Systems and Technology group improved in 2007 compared with 2006, and operating earnings topped $1 billion for the first time. The group experienced 11 percent organic growth in its core North American Tactical and Strategic Mission Systems and IT and Mission Services businesses. The IT and Mission Services business also benefitted from the acquisition of Anteon International Corporation (Anteon) in June 2006. These increases were offset partially by a steady but expected decline in volume in the group’s United Kingdom business, reduced activity in the group’s Intelligence Mission Systems business and a decline in activity in the commercial wireless market. General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report 27 Table of Contents The strong performance in the Tactical and Strategic Mission Systems business was due to higher activity on several command-and-control and communications programs for the U.S. military and increased volume on the group’s ground-based satellite communications programs. Notable drivers of the volume increase in 2007 included: • Combat Operations Centers (COC), which are mobile command-and-control systems used in Iraq; • Common Hardware/Software III (CHS-3), which provides commercial and ruggedized computers, network equipment and software to the U.S. armed forces and other federal agencies worldwide; and • Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), which enables on-the-move satellite connectivity for U.S. and allied forces. Volume was up in the IT and Mission Services business’s core defense market on the strength of such programs as Intelligence Information, Command-and-Control Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2) and Network-Centric Solutions (NETCENTS). ICE2 supports critical intelligence and command-and-control systems and networks for U.S. defense and intelligence operations worldwide and was the group’s largest program in 2007. NETCENTS provides network-centric IT, networking, communications products, systems solutions, and system hardware and software to federal agencies. Sales in the United Kingdom were down 33 percent as a result of the scheduled reduction in activity on the group’s BOWMAN communications program for the U.K. armed forces. In the group’s Intelligence Mission Systems business, sales decreased 9 percent in 2007. Approximately a quarter of the decline in sales was due to the loss of a classified program in 2007. Additionally, this business has experienced procurement delays due to a reallocation of defense funding to support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The group’s operating margins were down by 10 basis points compared with 2006 due to the group’s shift to include more IT services content, including the acquisition of Anteon. The company expects sales growth in the Information Systems and Technology group in 2008 in the 5 to 6 percent range as solid organic growth in the group’s North American businesses overcomes a further decline in sales in the U.K. operations. The company expects the volume on BOWMAN to decline an additional $50 to $100 in 2008, at which point the program is expected to reach a steady-state volume of ongoing logistics support and sustainment activity for the foreseeable future. The company expects that the group’s expanding services base will put moderate pressure on margins in 2008, resulting in a slight compression in the group’s operating margins in the 10 to 20 basis-point range. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 9,024 $ 7,826 $ 1,198 15.3 % Operating earnings 976 865 111 12.8 % Operating margin 10.8 % 11.1 % The Information Systems and Technology group’s sales and operating earnings increased due to business acquisitions in 2005 and 2006 and modest organic growth in the group’s North American business. The company acquired Anteon and FC Business Systems, Inc. (FCBS), in 2006 and three smaller acquisitions in the group’s Tactical and Strategic Mission Systems business in 2005. Overall, the group’s North American organic sales increased approximately 3 percent in 2006 due to higher activity on several key programs, including ICE2, NETCENTS, CHS-3, the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project and MUOS. Within the group’s United Kingdom business, sales on the BOWMAN program were down almost 20 percent in 2006 as the company began the transition from production and installation to maintenance and support activities. The group’s margins in 2006 were down as a result of the lower margins associated with the group’s expanded service profile. Backlog The Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog decreased slightly in 2007 to $9.6 billion compared with $10 billion at the end of 2006. At year end, the group’s funded backlog was $7.2 billion, down from $7.5 billion in 2006. Unlike the company’s other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts that have to be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards, and relatively few large-scale, long-term programs. The largest program in Information Systems and Technology’s backlog at year end is the Army’s Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) program. The group’s backlog at December 31, 2007, included $900 for WIN-T and its predecessor program, Joint Network Node (JNN). The Army restructured JNN and WIN-T into a single program in 2007. The company is the prime contractor on this battlefield communications network program that is designed to provide warfighters with fast, secure, mobile command-and-control capabilities. In 2007, the group received approximately $950 of awards for WIN-T to continue the design and development of the system and provide simulation and training. The group’s backlog also included approximately $430 for the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP). Under the MHP program, the company provides integrated mission systems for 28 state-of-the-art helicopters that are intended to replace Canada’s aging fleet of marine helicopters. 28 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report Table of Contents Other significant portions of the group’s year-end backlog include approximately $375 for the U.K.’s BOWMAN program, $300 for the ICE2 program, $290 for the MUOS program and $210 for CHS-3. The company received $440 in orders on the ICE2 program and over $100 of orders on CHS-3 in 2007. In addition to these programs, the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2007. The group was awarded a contract extension in 2007 worth approximately $100 to continue its support of the U.S. Joint Forces Command’s Joint Experimentation Program and Joint Futures Lab (JEXP), bringing the total contract value to approximately $375. Under this program, the group is providing engineering, technical and administrative services for joint force concept development. The Department of Homeland Security awarded the Information Systems and Technology group a task order under the Enterprise Acquisition Gateway for Leading Edge Solutions (EAGLE) program. Under the task order, which has a potential value of over $225 if all options are exercised, the group provides technology operations and maintenance services (TOMIS) for Citizen and Immigration Services at more than 280 locations nationwide. The group was awarded a contract worth approximately $90 by the Navy to provide modifications and support for fire control systems aboard U.S. and U.K. ballistic missile submarines and for the attack weapons control system aboard U.S. guided missile submarines. The contract has a total potential value of approximately $160 if all options are exercised. The U.K. Royal Air Force awarded the group a contract worth $95 for the tactical data link system of the Tactical Information Exchange Capability (TIEC) program. TIEC provides aircrews with enhanced situational awareness. The group received an initial order worth approximately $25 on a potential $300 contract to provide IT support services to the U.S. Senate. The group also received an initial order of $14 from the Army for support and engineering services on the Command Post of the Future (CPOF) program. The CPOF is an executive-level decision support system providing situational awareness and collaborative tools. This IDIQ program has a potential value of approximately $200. The group’s backlog does not include approximately $8.7 billion of potential contract value associated with IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. The value of these arrangements may be realized over the next 15 years. In 2007, funding under IDIQ contracts contributed over $2.2 billion, or approximately 25 percent of the group’s IDIQ contract value, to the group’s funded backlog, most notably from ICE2, CHS-3, JEXP and WIN-T. Information Systems and Technology was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2007. The group was selected by the Department of Justice as the system integrator for the Integrated Wireless Network (IWN). IWN is a collaborative effort between the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and the Treasury intended to provide secure, seamless, interoperable and reliable nationwide wireless voice, data and multimedia communications among federal agents and law enforcement officers engaged in disaster response, law enforcement, protective services and homeland defense. IWN is an IDIQ program with a potential value of $10 billion over 15 years, if all options are exercised. In addition, the group received one of 29 General Services Administration (GSA) Alliant contracts to provide federal government agencies with infrastructure, application and IT management services. Alliant is an IDIQ program with a $50 billion ceiling among all awardees over a 10-year period. CORPORATE Corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options and a portion of the earnings from the company’s commercial pension plans. Corporate operating expenses totaled $61 in 2007, $47 in 2006 and $6 in 2005. The increase in Corporate operating expense in 2007 and 2006 resulted from the initial recognition of stock option expense in 2006 and an increase in that expense from 2006 to 2007. (See Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company’s stock options.) The company expects 2008 stock option expense of approximately $75. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In the mid-1990s, General Dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment, generating strong cash flow to enable a series of acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond its core platform businesses. These acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded the company’s customer base. Since 1995, the company has acquired 47 businesses for a total cost of over $16.5 billion. These actions have resulted in a larger, more diversified company while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility.

General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report 29 Table of Contents The following is a discussion of the company’s major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion in 2007 and $2.1 billion in both 2006 and 2005. In each year, the two primary drivers of the company’s cash flow were net earnings and increasing levels of customer advances and deposits, particularly associated with successive years of record new-aircraft order activity in the Aerospace group. The cash flows from operations in 2007 resulted from the company’s strong net earnings, the significant deposits received at Gulfstream, and the collection of $270 of contract funds upon the resolution of the T-AKE REA in the Marine Systems group. This significant cash inflow was reduced by a $100 discretionary contribution to the company’s primary government pension plan. In 2006, net earnings generated the majority of the company’s operating cash flows, though approximately $150 of the net earnings related to a net gain on the sale of non-core businesses. The cash flow from these transactions is reported in investing activities. The other significant source of cash flow from operations was the substantial deposits received in connection with new business-jet orders. The 2005 cash flows from operations were driven by net earnings and an inflow of customer advances in the company’s European business. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to the company’s expectations, the default termination ultimately is sustained, the company and The Boeing Company could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2007. If this were the outcome, the company would owe approximately $1.4 billion pretax. The company’s after-tax cash obligation would be approximately $670. The company believes it has sufficient resources to pay such an obligation, if required, while still retaining ample liquidity. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $852 in 2007, $2.3 billion in 2006 and $181 in 2005. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures. In each year, these uses of cash were partially reduced by proceeds from divestiture activities. Business Acquisitions. In 2007, the company completed four acquisitions for a total of $330. In 2006, the company completed three acquisitions for a total of $2.3 billion. In 2005, the company completed three acquisitions for a total of approximately $275. The company financed these acquisitions using commercial paper and/or cash on hand. (See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions.) Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $474 in 2007, $334 in 2006 and $262 in 2005. The increase in 2007 over 2006 resulted from facility improvements in the Aerospace and the Marine Systems groups. The company expects capital expenditures of approximately $530 in 2008, less than 2 percent of sales. The company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2007. Sale of Assets. In 2007, the company sold its coal mining operation for approximately $25 in cash, net of taxes. In 2006, the company sold its aggregates business for approximately $315 in cash, net of taxes. In 2005, the company completed the sales of several small, non-core businesses. The company received approximately $300 in cash, net of taxes, from these divestiture activities. Available-for-Sale- Securities. As a result of the company’s strong cash position during 2007, the company expanded its investments in available-for-sale securities. Net purchases of these securities were $179 in 2007 and $12 in 2006 compared with net sales of $8 in 2005. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $786 in 2007, $539 in 2006 and $520 in 2005. The company’s typical financing activities are issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises. Debt Proceeds, Net. There were no material debt repayments in 2007. In 2006, the company repaid $500 of its fixed-rate debt on the scheduled maturity date. There were no material debt repayments in 2005. The company had no commercial paper outstanding as of the end of each of the past three years. The company has approximately $2 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon. These facilities are used to provide backup liquidity to the commercial paper program. In the second quarter of 2008, $500 of the company’s fixed-rate debt securities is scheduled to mature. In addition, $170 of the company’s senior notes and term debt matures in the second half of 2008. Dividends. The company’s board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share in March 2007, the 10th consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share in March 2006 and to $0.20 per share in March 2005. Share Repurchases. In 2007, the company repurchased 6.5 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market at an average price of $78 per share. In 2006, the company repurchased 1.2 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market at an average price of $63 per share. In 2005, the company repurchased 6.7 million shares at an average price of $54 per share. In December 2007, the company’s board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million shares of the company’s outstanding common stock on the open market. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 9.6 million shares remained under this authority – approximately 2 percent of the company’s total shares outstanding. 30 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report Table of Contents Non-GAAP Management Metrics General Dynamics’ management emphasizes the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. In 2007, for the ninth consecutive year, net cash provided by operating activities significantly exceeded net earnings. The company employed this cash to complete acquisitions, continue its trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase its outstanding shares. As a result of this continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment, the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) increased by 130 basis points during 2007 to 16.9 percent. The company’s ROIC has grown 450 basis points since 2003. Return on Invested Capital Management believes ROIC is a useful measure for investors, because it reflects the company’s ability to generate returns from the capital it has deployed in its operations. The company uses ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. Management defines ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. ROIC for 2003 through 2007 is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Earnings from continuing operations $ 2,080 $ 1,710 $ 1,448 $ 1,194 $ 954 After-tax interest expense 89 106 108 106 78 After-tax amortization expense 99 90 70 62 48 Net operating profit after taxes 2,268 1,906 1,626 1,362 1,080 Average debt and equity $ 13,430 $ 12,220 $ 10,948 $ 10,249 $ 8,691 Return on invested capital 16.9 % 15.6 % 14.9 % 13.3 % 12.4 % The company’s free cash flow from operations was $2.5 billion in 2007, $1.8 billion in each of 2006 and 2005, and $1.5 billion in each of 2004 and 2003. Management defines free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays the company’s ability to generate cash from its core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing its common stock and paying dividends. The company uses free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of its earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 2,952 $ 2,156 $ 2,033 $ 1,760 $ 1,671 Capital expenditures (474 ) (334 ) (262 ) (253 ) (202 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 2,478 $ 1,822 $ 1,771 $ 1,507 $ 1,469 Cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations 142 % 126 % 140 % 147 % 175 % Free cash flow from operations 119 % 107 % 122 % 126 % 154 % General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report 31 Table of Contents Over the past five years, the company has generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of its earnings from continuing operations during the period, an average 122 percent conversion rate. With free cash flow from operations projected to approximate earnings from continuing operations in 2008, the company expects to continue to generate funds in excess of its short- and long-term liquidity needs. Management believes the company has adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute its financial and operating strategy. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Off-balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2007, other than operating leases, the company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to the company’s stock and classified in shareholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; or variable interests in entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company or engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the company. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following tables present information about the company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2007: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 3,285 $ 785 $ 886 $ 132 $ 1,482 Capital lease obligations 3 1 2 — — Operating leases 774 161 237 119 257 Purchase obligations (b) 16,817 9,629 3,776 1,815 1,597 Other long-term liabilities (c) 12,369 2,065 1,918 1,339 7,047 $ 33,248 $ 12,641 $ 6,819 $ 3,405 $ 10,383 (a) Includes scheduled interest payments.

(b) Includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. This amount includes $11.3 billion of purchase orders for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which the company has full recourse under normal contract termination clauses. As disclosed in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company expects to make approximately $35 of contributions to its retirement plans in 2008. This amount has been excluded from the above amount. (c) Represents other long-term liabilities on the company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, including the current portion of long-term liabilities. The projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management’s estimates, which are largely based on historical experience. This amount also includes all liabilities under the company’s defined-benefit retirement plans, as discussed in Note Q. See Note Q for information regarding the plan assets available to satisfy these liabilities. Retirement plan assets and liabilities are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a plan-by-plan basis.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the company’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to long-term contracts and programs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers’ compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft 32 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report Table of Contents inventory, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition – Government Contracts. The company accounts for sales and earnings under long-term government contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method, the company recognizes contract revenue as the work progresses – either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered, as applicable. The company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input measures (e.g., costs incurred) or output measures (e.g., units delivered), as appropriate to the circumstances. The company follows the guidelines of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts. However, the company includes revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the reallocation method, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes (which has been superseded by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections), rather than the cumulative catch-up method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term, while under the cumulative catch-up method such impact would be recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified. Anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts, including G&A expenses. The company uses the reallocation method, because management believes the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates of total contract revenue, total costs or the extent of progress toward completion on the company’s long-term contracts affect both the period in which the change is identified and future periods. Management believes these changes generally reflect expectations as to future performance and, therefore, the reallocation method is the method that best matches the company’s revenues and earnings in the periods in which they are earned. While the company has applied this method consistently for over 30 years, most contractors use the cumulative catch-up method. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is currently considering a Standard on the hierarchy of GAAP, which, as currently drafted, would eliminate the company’s ability to use this method of accounting. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications. Contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the timing of product deliveries. These estimates are based on the company’s best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company’s contracts. The company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method. The company recognizes revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, management considers the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. The company recognizes revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. Estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance. Business Aircraft. The company accounts for contracts for business-jet aircraft in accordance with Statement of Position 81-1. These contracts usually provide for two major phases: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft (i.e., before exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics) and its completion. The company records revenue at two milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer. Goodwill. Since 1995, General Dynamics has acquired 47 businesses at a total cost of over $16.5 billion, including four in 2007. In connection with these acquisitions, the company has recognized $8.9 billion of goodwill. Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process that requires a significant level of estimation by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of the company’s reporting units, and these estimates require the use of judgment. Management estimates the fair value of the General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report 33 Table of Contents company’s reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations. This requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in the company’s backlog, the company’s performance and profitability under its contracts, its success in securing future business, and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows. This discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by “top-down” analyses, including a market assessment of the company’s enterprise value. Beyond the annual impairment test, factors that may lead the company to perform a goodwill impairment test include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of the company’s reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. The company has recorded no goodwill impairment to date and does not anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to an impairment in the foreseeable future. Commitments and Contingencies. The company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of its business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. The company records a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when the company’s exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of the company’s government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of the company’s estimated workers’ compensation, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally when they are paid. As permitted by AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Federal Government Contractors, the company has elected to defer these costs in contracts in process until they are paid, at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government. The company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. This business base includes numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. The company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under the company’s contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on management’s best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of the company’s remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. The company’s defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. The company determines the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. The company determines the long-term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on the company’s best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, future pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. The following hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the company’s commercial pension plans and post-retirement benefit plans would have had the following impact on 2007: Increase25 bps Decrease25 bps Increase (decrease) to net pension income from: Change in discount rate $ 3 $ (4 ) Change in long-term rate of return on plan assets 3 (3 ) Increase (decrease) to post-retirement benefit cost from: Change in discount rate $ (1 ) $ 1 Change in long-term rate of return on plan assets (1 ) 1 As discussed under Deferred Contract Costs, the company’s contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company’s government retirement plans. As permitted by AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Federal Government Contractors, the company has elected to defer recognition of the cumulative net unfunded benefit cost in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. As such, the company’s future earnings are not subject to the consequences of annual changes in the assumptions associated with these plans. Management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. New Accounting Standards In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS 157 defines “fair value” in the context of accounting and financial reporting and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP. SFAS 157 also expands the required disclosures regarding fair value measurements. In January 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date of SFAS 157 for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities to the first quarter of 2009. SFAS 157 is effective for financial assets and liabilities in the first quarter of 2008. The company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 34 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS 159 allows companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective in the first quarter of 2008. The company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations. SFAS 141R changes the requirements for accounting for business combinations, including the determination of purchase price and assignment of purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities. SFAS 141R is effective for acquisitions that are completed in the first quarter of 2009 and beyond. The company is currently analyzing the expected impact of the adoption of this Statement on future acquisitions. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements – An Amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS 160 establishes new accounting for noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective in the first quarter of 2009. The company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Foreign Currency Risk The company’s foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers, outstanding debt and certain inter-company transactions denominated in currencies other than the company’s (or one of its subsidiaries’) functional currency. The company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to fix the amount of firmly committed and forecasted non-functional payments, receipts and inter-company transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities. These contracts are designed to minimize non-functional currency risks and/or risks associated with international subsidiaries that may enter into transactions outside of their own functional currency. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the company had $1.7 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, in notional contracts outstanding. A 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company’s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental recognized pretax loss of $29 in 2007 and $4 in 2006, and an incremental unrecognized pretax loss of $53 in 2007 and $40 in 2006. This exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar and euro/Swiss franc exchange rates. The company believes the recognized and unrecognized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. Interest Rate Risk Financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate debt obligations, variable-rate commercial paper and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the company had only fixed-rate debt outstanding. The company’s fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable and are not traded by the company in the market. A 10 percent change in current interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of the company’s fixed-rate debt obligations. The company would be subject to interest rate risk from outstanding commercial paper, but there were no outstanding balances at year-end 2007 or 2006. The company’s investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of five years. The company held $3.1 billion in cash and equivalents and short-term investments to be used for general corporate purposes as of December 31, 2007, and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2006. Given the weighted average maturity of 15 days as of December 31, 2007, and 11 days as of December 31, 2006, a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings in either year. Historically, the company has not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates. Commodity Price Risk The company is also subject to risk of rising labor and commodity prices, primarily on long-term fixed-price contracts. To the extent possible, the company includes terms in its contracts that are designed to protect it from this risk. The company has not entered into commodity hedging contracts but may do so as circumstances warrant. Some of the protective terms included in the company’s contracts are considered derivatives but are not accounted for separately because they are clearly and closely related to the host contract. The company does not believe that changes in labor or commodity prices will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows.

40533,GD,GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP,2009,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (For an overview of our business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW General Dynamics offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; shipbuilding design and construction; and information systems, technologies and services. We operate through four business groups – Aerospace, Combat Systems, Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology. Our primary customers are the U.S. military, other U.S. government organizations, the armed forces of other nations, and a diverse base of corporate, government and individual buyers of business aircraft. We operate in two primary markets: defense and business aviation. The majority of our revenues derive from contracts with the U.S. military. The nation’s engagement in the global war on terror, coupled with the need to modernize U.S. military forces, has driven steady Department of Defense funding increases since 2001. In particular, procurement and research and development (R&D) budgets, also known as investment accounts, provide the majority of our revenues. Defense Department total, or top-line, funding has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 6.9 percent from fiscal 2001 through 2009, while procurement and R&D spending has grown nearly 7.3 percent annually during that period. For fiscal year 2009, the Congress appropriated $516 billion for the Department of Defense, including approximately $182 billion for procurement and R&D. Budget expenditures generally lag congressional funding, and we expect that expenditures applied toward programs over the next few years will be consistent with defense funding appropriated in recent years. Our future growth potential in the U.S. defense market is driven by the size of the defense budget, the allocation of that budget to investment accounts, the diversity of our exposure to different programs and customers within the budget, and our successful execution of the contracts we are awarded. During this period of war, defense budgets have included the President’s budget submission, as well as supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year to meet the emergent needs of the warfighter. For fiscal year 2008, the Congress appropriated $183 billion in emergency spending, including approximately $68 billion, or 37 percent, for investment accounts. For fiscal year 2009, the Congress has appropriated $66 billion in supplemental funding, primarily for battlefield operational requirements. The Defense Department has indicated that it will request at least another $70 billion of supplemental funding in 2009 to include funds for procuring additional weaponry. If this second supplemental is approved, defense funding for fiscal year 2009 will total approximately $652 billion, a 110 percent increase since 2001. Looking ahead, we expect defense core budget top-line growth to moderate. In the near-term, top-line funding should remain at or near current well-funded levels, led by the need to continue to support ongoing war operations. While the landscape will continue to evolve in conjunction with the new administration’s defense strategy as well as dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, we expect near-term defense funding levels to be driven primarily by the following: • continued support for the warfighter from the administration and the Congress in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment; • the number of troops deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq, coupled with the increase in the overall size of the U.S. military; • the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed during the war; • the need to maintain thousands of jobs that support the health of our nation’s military infrastructure; and • the need to modernize that infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern-day warfare. Future supplemental funding levels will likely decrease in tandem with the administration’s current plan to reduce troop levels in Iraq, offset somewhat by an increased footprint in Afghanistan. As this supplemental spending decreases, some of the supplemental funding that had previously been used to finance core procurement programs will likely shift back to the base budget. Beyond our U.S. defense market, governments around the world continue to fund weapons and equipment modernization programs, leading to significant defense export opportunities. We are committed to pursuing international opportunities presented by international demand for military hardware and information technologies. While the revenue upside can be significant, European and other international defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing, defense priorities and overall fiscal spending pressures. As we broaden the customer base for our defense products around the world, we expect growing international sales. The business-aviation market remained strong for much of 2008. While mid-size order activity moderated from past years, Gulfstream enjoyed continued strong order activity for its long-range and ultra-long-range business-jet offerings, including its new G650 product. Market conditions changed significantly, however, in the fourth quarter of 2008 as credit and financial markets seized in reaction to deteriorating global economic conditions. This severe dislocation caused new aircraft order activity to slow. This sudden financial turmoil affected some of Gulfstream’s customers who either sought deferral or defaulted on their aircraft orders. General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report 19 Table of Contents These perturbations in the group’s backlog had no impact to financial performance in 2008 due largely to the willingness of customers in the backlog to move up to earlier availabilities. If the market continues to erode, additional defaults and deferrals may occur. However, we believe the diversity and duration of the business-jet order book positions the Aerospace group to bridge the current market turmoil. Aircraft-service revenues, which grew 8 percent in 2008, provide the group diversified exposure to after-market sales fueled by recent growth in the global installed business-jet fleet. We believe continued investment in new aircraft products will drive long-term growth, particularly when the Aerospace group begins delivering its newest aircraft offerings, the G250 in 2011 and the G650 in 2012. We are committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices, disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements. Our solid performance is measured in our sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow. General Dynamics’ record as an industry leader in cash flow generation has provided our management the flexibility to execute our operational strategy, and enabled us to consistently deploy resources to further enhance shareholder returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchases. CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW The following discussion of our results of operations is based on operating performance at the business group level. The disclosures focus on the material financial measures our management uses to evaluate the performance of each of our four business groups, including sales, operating earnings and margins, cash flow, and orders and backlog. For the defense business groups, the discussion of results of operations is based on specific contracts and programs that drive the group’s results rather than types of products and services, which often comprise multiple contracts with different customers. For the Aerospace group, the results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services, consistent with how the group is managed. In the defense business groups, the majority of the sales are generated by long-term government contracts. As discussed further in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section, we account for sales under these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this method, revenue is recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered, as applicable. As a result, changes in sales are generally discussed in terms of volume. Volume indicates increases or decreases in sales due to changes in production or construction activity levels, changes in delivery schedules or levels of services on individual contracts. In the Aerospace group, we recognize revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. Sales contracts for new aircraft have two major phases: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s completion, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics. We record revenues on these contracts at two milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the aircraft. Revenues in the Aerospace group’s Jet Aviation aircraft outfitting business are recognized as work progresses, similar to our defense businesses. Aircraft services revenues are recognized upon delivery of services. Changes in sales in this group result from the number of new aircraft deliveries (both green and completion), the progress toward completion of aircraft outfitting activities, the level of service activity during the period and the number of pre-owned aircraft sold. Operating earnings and margins in the defense business groups are generally discussed in terms of changes in sales volume, performance, or the mix of contracts (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) and the phases of work within those contracts (e.g., development/production). Performance refers to changes in contract earnings rates during the term of the contract based on revisions to estimates of profit at completion on individual contracts. These revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract and/or the estimated costs required to complete the contract. The following discussion of results provides additional disclosure to the extent that a material or unusual event causes a change in the profitability of a contract. Operating earnings and margins in the Aerospace group are generally a function of the prices we are able to charge for our various aircraft models, the operational efficiency of the group in the manufacture and completion of the aircraft, and the mix of aircraft deliveries among the higher-margin large-cabin and lower-margin mid-size aircraft. Additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margins include the volume and profitability of services work performed, the number and type of pre-owned aircraft sold, and the level of general and administrative costs incurred by the group, which include selling expenses and research and development costs. 20 General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Net sales $ 29,300 $ 27,240 $ 2,060 7.6 % Operating earnings 3,653 3,113 540 17.3 % Operating margin 12.5 % 11.4 % In 2008, we achieved solid growth in sales and a significant increase in operating earnings compared with 2007. This strong performance during the year resulted in our highest operating margin in eight years backed by continued strong cash flows from operations. We received a record level of orders in 2008, ending the year with the highest backlog in our history. Each of our four business groups produced increases in sales in 2008 over the prior year. Sales growth in the Aerospace and Marine Systems groups was particularly strong in 2008 as a result of continued increases in business-jet aircraft deliveries and increased activity on U.S. Navy and commercial shipbuilding programs. In the Combat Systems group, strong demand for U.S. military vehicles and related support services drove the increase in sales. Higher activity in tactical and strategic mission systems contributed the majority of the sales growth in the Information Systems and Technology group. Our operating earnings increased at more than double the rate of sales growth in 2008, and three of our four business groups reported earnings in excess of $1 billion. Growth in operating earnings exceeded the sales growth in all of our business groups due to strong program execution and a continued focus on operating performance. Overall, our operating margins increased 110 basis points to 12.5 percent in 2008, the fifth consecutive year of margin expansion. Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 27,240 $ 24,063 $ 3,177 13.2 % Operating earnings 3,113 2,625 488 18.6 % Operating margin 11.4 % 10.9 % We produced significant sales growth in 2007 on the strength of rising sales in each of our business groups. In particular, the Combat Systems and Aerospace groups generated substantial sales growth in 2007 on U.S. military vehicle sales and increased business-jet deliveries. Sales in the Information Systems and Technology group increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of Anteon International Corporation in mid-2006. Sales were up slightly in the Marine Systems group compared with 2006. Our operating earnings grew at a higher rate than sales in 2007, as three of our four business groups achieved significant operating leverage. The Aerospace group’s earnings and margins reflected the strength of improved pricing and ongoing productivity improvements. Operating earnings and margins were up in Combat Systems and Marine Systems due to improved operational execution across a variety of programs. Our overall operating margins improved 50 basis points in 2007 to 11.4 percent. Cash Flow Cash flows from operations in 2008 exceeded net earnings for the tenth consecutive year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion in 2008, $2.9 billion in 2007 and $2.1 billion in 2006. In addition, we generated over $300 in cash in 2006 from the sale of several non-core businesses. Over the three-year period, we used our cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase our common stock, pay dividends and repay maturing debt. Our net debt – debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities – was $2.3 billion at the end of 2008 compared with a net surplus of $268 at the end of 2007. Our net debt increased by $2.5 billion during the year after $3.2 billion spent on acquisitions, over $1.5 billion of share repurchases, $533 of dividends paid, $490 of capital expenditures and more than $470 of company-sponsored research and development during the year. Other Financial Information General and administrative (G&A) expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 5.9 percent in 2008 from 6 percent in 2007 and 6.2 percent in 2006, reflecting our continued emphasis on operating leverage. G&A was $1.7 billion in 2008, $1.6 billion in 2007 and $1.5 billion in 2006. We expect 2009 G&A as a percent of sales to approximate the 2008 rate. Net interest expense was $66 in 2008 compared with $70 in 2007 and $101 in 2006. Interest income generated by our strong cash position has increased during each of the past three years while scheduled repayments of our long-term debt have steadily reduced interest expense. We expect net interest expense to increase to approximately $140 to $150 in 2009 due to the issuance of additional debt in 2008. Our effective tax rate was 31.2 percent in 2008, 31.7 percent in 2007 and 32.3 percent in 2006. In 2008, our taxes were reduced by a refund associated with the settlement of outstanding litigation. This resulted in a $35, or approximately $0.09 per-share, benefit that reduced our 2008 tax rate by 100 basis points. Our effective tax rate in 2007 was impacted favorably by the resolution of our 2003 to 2004 federal income tax audit with the Internal Revenue Service. This settlement resulted in a benefit of $18, or approximately $0.04 per share, which reduced our effective tax rate by 60 basis points. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 31.5 to 32 percent in 2009. For additional discussion of tax matters, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Discontinued Operations In 2008, we entered into an agreement to sell our Spanish nitrocellulose operation and recognized a pretax loss of $11 in discontinued operations. We expect the sale to close in the first quarter of 2009. In 2007, we completed the sale of our coal mining operation and received proceeds of approximately $25. We had previously recognized a pretax loss of $57 in discontinued operations in 2006 in anticipation of the sale. General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report 21 Table of Contents In 2006, we completed the sale of our aggregates operation. We received approximately $315 in cash from the sale of this business and recognized a pretax gain of $199 in discontinued operations. Our reported net sales exclude the revenues associated with these divested businesses. We have included their operating results, along with the gains and losses from the transactions discussed above, as discontinued operations, net of income taxes. For additional discussion of our divestiture activities and the results of discontinued operations, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contact Value Our total backlog increased almost 60 percent in 2008 to $74.1 billion at the end of the year. Funded backlog was $51.7 billion at year end, up 39 percent over 2007. We received $57 billion of new orders in 2008, the highest level in our history. Order activity was significant across each of our business groups, resulting in backlog growth in each group in 2008. The total backlog for our defense businesses increased 49 percent in 2008 to $51.6 billion, compared with $34.6 billion at the end of 2007. The defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog was $29.9 billion at the end of 2008, up 17 percent over 2007. This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. The unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders that do not meet these criteria. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, we have included in the backlog only firm contracts we believe are likely to receive funding. The Aerospace group’s total backlog reached a record level of $22.5 billion at year-end 2008 compared with $12.3 billion at the end of 2007, an increase of more than 83 percent. The group’s funded backlog increased almost 90 percent during the year to $21.9 billion at the end of 2008. The funded backlog represents orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. The Aerospace unfunded backlog of $618 at the end of 2008 consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. Our backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft, which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value. IDIQ contracts are used when the customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed. These agreements, which set forth the majority of the contractual terms, including prices, are funded as delivery orders are placed. A significant portion of our IDIQ value represents contracts for which we have been designated as the sole-source supplier to design, develop, produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies. Management believes the customers intend to fully implement these systems. The estimated potential contract value also includes our estimate of the value we will receive under multiple-award IDIQ contracts in which we are one of several companies competing for task orders under the contract. Because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer’s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders, we recognize these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. Contract options in our defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts, if the customer exercises the option. These options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date. Contract options in the Aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft, including long-term option agreements with fleet customers. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. As of December 31, 2008, the estimated potential value associated with these IDIQ contracts and contract options was approximately $16.8 billion, up from $14.5 billion at the end of 2007. We expect to realize this value over the next 10 to 15 years. This represents management’s estimate of the potential value we will receive. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower. REVIEW OF OPERATING SEGMENTS AEROSPACE Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Net sales $ 5,512 $ 4,828 $ 684 14.2 % Operating earnings 1,021 810 211 26.0 % Operating margin 18.5 % 16.8 % Aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 156 138 18 13.0 % Completion 152 138 14 10.1 % 22 General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report Table of Contents The Aerospace group generated significant sales growth in 2008, attributable primarily to increased aircraft deliveries compared with 2007. The group increased aircraft production rates for the fifth consecutive year in 2008 in response to a steadily growing aircraft backlog. As a result, new aircraft sales increased 12 percent in 2008. Sequential years of higher new aircraft deliveries have expanded the group’s worldwide installed base of business-jet aircraft. As a result, demand in the group’s aircraft services business grew in 2008, with volume up 8 percent compared to 2007. Our November 2008 acquisition of Jet Aviation, a business-jet outfitting and aviation-services company, also contributed to the group’s sales growth. Approximately one-quarter of the group’s increase in sales in 2008 came from the addition of Jet Aviation. Pre-owned aircraft sales were $18 in 2008, down from $78 in 2007. The group had four pre-owned aircraft available for sale on December 31, 2008. The Aerospace group’s operating earnings increased at a significantly higher rate than sales in 2008. The following factors impacted the group’s growth in operating earnings during the year: Increased aircraft deliveries $ 146 Pricing, delivery mix and productivity improvements 105 Increased aircraft services 11 Pre-owned aircraft activity (25 ) General and administrative expenses (26 ) Total increase in operating earnings $ 211 Operating earnings and margins on the group’s 2008 aircraft deliveries were up compared with the units delivered in 2007, the result of improved pricing on aircraft orders over the past several years. The group also continued to generate productivity improvements in the aircraft assembly and outfitting processes, which further improved earnings in 2008. In late 2008, the number of pre-owned aircraft transactions was significantly curtailed in response to the deterioration of the global economic environment. As a result, the group wrote down the carrying value of the four pre-owned aircraft available for sale at year end. The group’s earnings growth was also tempered by increased selling expenses from strong order activity and higher product-development costs associated with the introduction of two new aircraft models in 2008. The net effect of these factors was a 170 basis-point increase in operating margins in 2008, following two years of 120 basis-point improvement. The significant deterioration in the economic environment in late 2008 weakened the global demand for business jets, particularly in the mid-size aircraft segment. As a consequence of these conditions and the relatively short duration of the group’s mid-size backlog, we plan to significantly reduce mid-size aircraft production in 2009. Given the substantial level and duration of the large-cabin aircraft backlog, we expect to increase production of these models in 2009. However, we assess aircraft production requirements quarterly and will modify the group’s production and delivery schedule as necessary based on the state of our backlog and market conditions. We also expect more pre-owned activity in 2009 than we experienced in 2008 or 2007. Of the contracts for 2009 aircraft deliveries, approximately 10 include aircraft trade-in options, which the customers may elect to exercise. Including the effect of a full year of results of Jet Aviation, we expect the Aerospace group’s 2009 sales to increase between 20 and 25 percent over 2008. We expect the group’s operating margins to be 200 to 220 basis points lower than those achieved in 2008 due primarily to the increase in aircraft-services volume associated with the Jet Aviation acquisition. Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 4,828 $ 4,116 $ 712 17.3 % Operating earnings 810 644 166 25.8 % Operating margin 16.8 % 15.6 % Aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 138 113 25 22.1 % Completion 138 104 34 32.7 % The Aerospace group’s sales and operating earnings increased significantly in 2007 over 2006. To meet growing global demand, the group increased aircraft production in 2007 resulting in new-aircraft sales growth of 22 percent compared with the prior year. Aircraft-services volume also increased 20 percent over 2006. Sales of pre-owned aircraft decreased to $78 in 2007 from $217 in 2006 as favorable market conditions led more customers to sell their own aircraft rather than trade them in. Operating earnings in 2007 increased approximately $205 as a result of the higher new-aircraft and aircraft-services volume. The earnings growth was also driven by improved pricing on units delivered in 2007 compared with 2006 as well as labor efficiencies and productivity improvements, particularly in the aircraft-completion process. These factors contributed a $65 increase in earnings in 2007. Higher selling and G&A costs and product-development spending reduced the group’s earnings growth by approximately $90, and lower sales of pre-owned aircraft reduced the earnings growth by $14. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report 23 Table of Contents The Aerospace group’s backlog increased 83 percent in 2008 to $22.5 billion at year end, the largest backlog in the group’s history. The group’s funded backlog was $21.9 billion at year end, up 89 percent over 2007. In 2008, the group received $15.4 billion in new orders, a record level for the fifth consecutive year and an increase of 67 percent over 2007. In addition, the acquisition of Jet Aviation in the fourth quarter added approximately $750 to the group’s backlog related to agreements to perform outfitting work for other equipment manufacturers. In the second quarter of 2008, the group began taking orders for the Gulfstream G650, a new ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin business jet that is scheduled to enter service in 2012. In the fourth quarter, the group introduced and began taking orders for the Gulfstream G250, a new super-mid-size business jet that is scheduled to enter service in 2011. The group experienced strong demand in North America as well as a growing proportion of international orders in 2008. Over 50 percent of the group’s orders in 2008 were from customers outside North America for the second year in a row. The group’s backlog includes scheduled aircraft deliveries for large-cabin models through periods ranging from 2011 to 2017. The backlog does not include options to purchase new aircraft, including long-term agreements with fleet customers. These options totaled $2.3 billion at the end of 2008 and are included in estimated potential contract value. As a result of the sharp decline in global economic conditions in 2008, the group had some customers default on their contracts late in the fourth quarter. These defaults had no impact on the group’s 2008 deliveries. We were able to fill those production slots with other customers who were interested in moving forward in the delivery queue. Despite the defaults, the backlog grew in 2008 as the group achieved a book-to-bill ratio (aircraft orders divided by deliveries) greater than one for the fifth consecutive year. While the backlog continues to have some risk, particularly if the economic climate worsens, we will continue to work with customers to minimize the future impact to the group’s performance. * Represents ratio of new aircraft orders to deliveries (in units) during the year.

COMBAT SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Net sales $ 8,194 $ 7,797 $ 397 5.1 % Operating earnings 1,111 916 195 21.3 % Operating margin 13.6 % 11.7 % The Combat Systems group’s net sales increased in 2008 compared with 2007. The group’s sales growth was driven by its U.S. military vehicle business: U.S. military vehicles $ 655 Weapons systems and munitions (140 ) European military vehicles (118 ) Total increase in sales $ 397 The increase in U.S. military vehicle sales was driven primarily by higher activity on the group’s mine-resistant, ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicle program and several contracts in support of the group’s Abrams main battle tank modernization efforts. Under the MRAP program, which emerged in late 2007, the group produces RG-31 and Cougar armored vehicles for the U.S. Department of Defense. The group is scheduled to complete deliveries of its remaining RG-31 MRAP vehicles under contract in the first quarter of 2009. Under the Abrams program, volume was up most notably in 2008 on the System Enhancement Package (SEP) upgrade and on contracts to repair and reset battle-damaged M1 tanks. Sales in the group’s weapons systems business decreased in 2008 due to fewer deliveries of systems that help protect U.S. combat forces from improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Sales increased slightly on the group’s munitions programs over 2007, particularly on its large- and medium-caliber munitions supply contracts for the United States and Canada. 24 General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report Table of Contents In the group’s European military vehicles business, volume was lower during the year on several international military vehicle programs including the Leopard tank program with the Spanish government. The decrease in sales in 2008 on these programs was offset slightly by increased volume on the group’s Piranha wheeled armored vehicle contract for Belgium and higher activity within the group’s mobile bridge business. In December 2007, the group received a notice of termination from the Czech Republic regarding its contract to deliver 199 Pandur II military vehicles. In the second quarter of 2008, we entered into a memorandum of understanding and a testing agreement with the Czech Republic regarding the testing and acceptance of 17 vehicles that had been completed by the group. We are negotiating a revised contract for the purchase of 107 vehicles, including the 17 completed vehicles. We do not believe the outcome of the negotiations will have a material effect on the group’s operating results. Due to ongoing negotiations, there were no sales recognized under this contract in 2008, but we expect to continue production upon finalization of the revised contract. The Combat Systems group’s operating earnings grew significantly in 2008, increasing at more than four times the rate of sales growth during the year. While the most significant driver of the group’s earnings growth was improved performance in the U.S. military vehicle business, particularly on the MRAP and Abrams programs, each of the group’s businesses generated at least a 100 basis-point increase in margins in 2008. The operating leverage achieved across Combat Systems’ operations in 2008 produced an overall 190 basis-point improvement in the group’s operating margins compared with 2007. On December 19, 2008, we acquired AxleTech International (AxleTech) of Troy, Michigan. AxleTech is a global manufacturer and supplier of highly engineered axles, suspensions, brakes and aftermarket parts for heavy-payload vehicles for a variety of military and commercial customers. We expect Combat Systems to produce sales growth of approximately 20 to 25 percent in 2009, including the addition of AxleTech’s revenues. We expect the group’s operating margins to return to a more sustainable mid-12 percent level in 2009. Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 7,797 $ 5,983 $ 1,814 30.3 % Operating earnings 916 677 239 35.3 % Operating margin 11.7 % 11.3 % In 2007, Combat Systems generated the greatest growth in sales and operating earnings among our four business groups. Each of the group’s businesses experienced double-digit sales and earnings growth over 2006. More than half of the growth resulted from increased volume in the group’s U.S. military vehicle business, including higher activity on Abrams-related contracts and the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program, the ramp-up of production of light armored vehicles (LAVs) for the U.S. Marine Corps, and increased production of MRAP military vehicles. Sales increased almost 50 percent in the group’s munitions business in 2007 due to strong volume in its large- and medium-caliber munitions supply contracts and the acquisition of SNC Technologies Inc. in January 2007. In the group’s weapons systems business, sales grew 13 percent in 2007 due primarily to increased activity on its counter-IED contract. The European military vehicle business experienced sales growth of almost 30 percent in 2007. This growth resulted primarily from increased activity on Pandur and Piranha wheeled vehicle contracts for several European governments. The group’s operating margins increased 40 basis points in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a shift in contract mix and improved performance across a number of the group’s wheeled military vehicle programs. The margin growth was limited somewhat by the inclusion of lower-margin acquisitions in the munitions business, increased supplier costs on the group’s small-caliber munitions contract and costs recognized in connection with our exit from the group’s European commercial trading business. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Combat Systems group’s total backlog was $15 billion at the end of 2008, an increase of 16 percent over 2007. Funded backlog grew 12 percent in 2008 to $12.1 billion at year end. The group’s backlog consists primarily of long-term production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through 2014. The group’s backlog on December 31, 2008, included approximately $3.8 billion for M1 Abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs. These include the M1A2 SEP, Abrams Integrated Management (AIM) and Tank Urban Survivability Kit (TUSK) programs. Under the SEP program, we retrofit M1A2 Abrams main battle tanks with improved electronics, command-and-control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank’s effectiveness. Over 50 percent of the group’s Abrams backlog at year end was for the SEP program. During 2008, the group was awarded a multi-year contract with a potential value of $1.2 billion from the U.S. Army to upgrade 435 M1A1 Abrams vehicles to the SEP Version Two (V2) configuration and received funding of $830 for 317 of those vehicles. Under the AIM program, M1 Abrams General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report 25 Table of Contents main battle tanks are completely overhauled and returned to a like-new condition. TUSK is a technological upgrade that improves the effectiveness of the tank in urban warfare environments. In 2008, the group received awards from the Army totaling $320 for the AIM and TUSK programs combined. At year end, the Abrams backlog included approximately $530 for these contracts. Additionally, the group received combined orders from the Army worth approximately $290 for Abrams systems technical support in 2008. The Combat Systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately $1.8 billion for the Army’s Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program, including the production of nearly 800 vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2011. In 2008, the group received orders valued at $2.1 billion from the Army under the Stryker program, including awards worth approximately $900 for the production of 677 Stryker vehicles and over $260 for Stryker modification kits to be used in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The group also received awards in 2008 totaling $600 for Stryker contractor logistics and field support, including reset and battle-damage repair. The group’s backlog for the Army’s Future Combat Systems (FCS) program totaled $1.2 billion at the end of 2008. The group leads the system development of the manned ground vehicles (MGV) element of the program, as well as the development of the autonomous navigation systems for FCS unmanned ground vehicles. The group’s current contract extends through 2013. Approximately $880 was included in the Combat Systems group’s backlog at the end of the year for the Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program. The group is building seven new prototypes under the system design and development phase of the EFV program and received orders of approximately $980 related to this effort in 2008. The group’s backlog at year end included approximately $700 under the MRAP program. The group produces two separate vehicles under this program – the Cougar, in connection with its joint venture partner, and the RG-31. In 2008, the group received MRAP orders valued at nearly $1.1 billion for production of 778 RG-31 and 184 Cougar vehicles and related vehicle support and spare parts. Deliveries under the Cougar program were completed in 2008. The group’s deliveries of the RG-31 vehicles remaining under this contract are scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2009. The Combat Systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog. The backlog at the end of the year included: • $560 for the production of 190 Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles scheduled for delivery to the Spanish army through 2014. • $360 for the production of 85 Leopard 2E battle tanks, which the group produces for the Spanish army using a design licensed from a German company. Deliveries are scheduled through 2010. • $340 for the Pandur II vehicle contract with the Czech Republic that is currently being renegotiated. The backlog amount represents the estimated value of a revised contract for the purchase of 107 vehicles. • $275 for a contract with the government of Belgium for 116 Piranha wheeled military vehicles. • $230 from the Swiss government to provide 232 Duro wheeled armored personnel vehicles and 12 Piranha wheeled military vehicles. • $165 for a contract with the government of Portugal for 226 Pandur II wheeled vehicles. • $120 for a contract with the German government to provide 192 Eagle IV wheeled military vehicles. The Combat Systems group’s backlog at year end also included approximately $2.5 billion in weapons systems, munitions, detection systems and composite-structures programs. In 2008, the group received awards totaling $250 for the production of Hydra-70 rockets, bringing the total contract value to date to nearly $800. The group also received awards of approximately $125 from the Army in 2008 for the production of small-caliber ammunition, bringing the total contract value to date to almost $700. MARINE SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Net sales $ 5,556 $ 4,993 $ 563 11.3 % Operating earnings 521 421 100 23.8 % Operating margin 9.4 % 8.4 % Net sales in the Marine Systems group improved in 2008 as a result of increased activity across each of the group’s shipyards. The growth in the group’s sales consisted of the following: Mature Navy ship production $ 270 Commercial ship production 184 Navy design and early-stage production 154 Other (45 ) Total increase in sales $ 563 Approximately 60 percent of the Marine Systems group’s sales in both 2008 and 2007 were produced by three mature ship-production programs for the U.S. Navy – the Virginia-class submarine, the T-AKE combat-logistics ship and the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) destroyer. Activity increased on the Virginia program in 2008 as the group continued construction on its cost-reimbursable Block I contract and its fixed-price Block II contract. The final Block I ship and the first Block II ship were delivered in 2008, and construction is in process on the remaining five Block II ships. The group received a multi-year, eight-ship Block III award in the fourth quarter of 2008, and as a result, the group expects 26 General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report Table of Contents to increase production to two ships per year beginning in 2011. Including Block III, deliveries are scheduled through 2018. On the T-AKE program, volume increased in 2008 as the group delivered the fifth and sixth ships and continued construction of the seventh through tenth ships of the group’s 14-ship program. Deliveries are scheduled through 2012. Activity on the Arleigh Burke destroyer program decreased slightly in 2008 compared with 2007. The group delivered two destroyers in 2008, and construction is in process on the remaining four ships under contract with deliveries scheduled through 2011. The group’s product carrier program produced the increase in commercial shipbuilding volume in 2008. Construction of the first three ships ramped up in 2008, and the first ship was delivered in early 2009. The next two ships are scheduled to be delivered in the second half of 2009. In addition to the large ship-construction programs, sales increased on the group’s design and early-stage production contracts for the Navy. Most notably, volume increased on the group’s DDG-1000 next-generation destroyer program. The completion of the group’s SSGN submarine conversion contract in the fourth quarter of 2007 slightly offset the other volume increases in the group in 2008. The Marine Systems group improved its performance significantly in 2008, increasing operating earnings at double the rate of sales growth. As a result of operational efficiencies realized at each of its shipyards, the group increased program earnings rates in 2008 on the Virginia, DDG-51, T-AKE and commercial product carrier programs. These improvements generated an overall 100 basis-point increase in the group’s operating margins over 2007. We expect sales growth in the Marine Systems group of approximately 5 to 6 percent in 2009 as the group continues to deliver on its record backlog. We expect the group’s operating margins to increase slightly with continued operating efficiencies at each of the shipyards. Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 4,993 $ 4,940 $ 53 1.1 % Operating earnings 421 375 46 12.3 % Operating margin 8.4 % 7.6 % The Marine Systems group’s sales were up slightly in 2007 compared with 2006. Combined sales from the Virginia-class, T-AKE and Arleigh Burke destroyer programs in 2007 were essentially unchanged compared with 2006. Activity was up significantly on the T-AKE contract, but volume on the Virginia and Arleigh Burke programs declined in 2007. Volume was up across the group’s ship design, engineering, repair and overhaul, and early-stage construction programs for the Navy, including the detail design of the DDG-1000 and the construction of the first Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). Volume on these two programs increased more than 60 percent in 2007 compared with 2006. Additionally, activity was up more than 10 percent on the group’s engineering, repair and overhaul contracts for the Navy in 2007, particularly in the group’s nuclear submarine support and logistics services business. Combined sales on the group’s SSGN submarine conversion program and commercial ship construction programs decreased more than 50 percent during the year as the group completed its fourth and final SSGN submarine conversion in 2007 and its four-ship commercial tanker program in 2006. The Marine Systems group’s operating earnings and margins grew significantly in 2007 on steady sales. The group generated operating efficiencies that led to improved performance on several of its key programs, including the Virginia-class submarine, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer and the SSGN submarine conversions. Additionally, we reached an agreement with the Navy in 2007 to restructure the T-AKE contract. The agreement included a resolution of an outstanding request for equitable adjustment (REA), which resulted in revised pricing on ships one through nine and the addition of five option ships. Prior to the agreement, we recognized revenue on the T-AKE program at a break-even level pending the resolution of the REA. After the contract restructuring, the program estimate at completion was revised, and we began recognizing profit on the contract in the second quarter of 2007. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Marine Systems group’s backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as numerous repair and engineering contracts. At the end of 2008, the group’s backlog reached an all-time high of $26.4 billion, more than double the $12.1 billion backlog at the end of 2007. The group’s funded backlog increased 38 percent in 2008 to $10.5 billion at the end of the year. The group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years. The current backlog includes shipbuilding deliveries through 2018. The Virginia-class submarine program is the largest contract in the group’s backlog. The group’s backlog at year end included $18.1 billion for 13 Virginia-class submarines to be delivered through 2018. The group received $14.5 billion in Virginia-class orders in 2008, including a $13.8 billion Block III award for the construction of eight submarines. The contract included $2.3 billion of funding for construction of the first ship and long-lead materials for the second ship. As the prime contractor on the Virginia-class program, we report the entire backlog and sales associated with the program but share the construction and the earnings equally with our teaming partner. The current Navy plan calls General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report 27 Table of Contents for construction of one submarine in 2009 and 2010 and two per year from 2011 to 2013. The Marine Systems group’s backlog at year end also included $1.8 billion for the Navy’s T-AKE combat-logistics ship program. In 2008, the group received $1.6 billion in T-AKE orders, including the exercise of the options for ships 10 through 12 and long-lead materials for the 13th and 14th ships. Deliveries of these ships are scheduled through 2012. Navy destroyer programs represent another significant component of the group’s backlog. These include the Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 and Zumwalt-class DDG-1000 destroyer programs. At year end, the backlog included approximately $765 for the remaining four DDG-51 destroyers under contract. Deliveries are scheduled through 2011, including two in 2009. In 2008, the group received one of two contracts worth approximately $1.4 billion for the construction of a DDG-1000 destroyer, scheduled to be delivered in 2013. The group’s backlog at the end of 2008 included $1.5 billion for the completion of the design effort and construction of the DDG-1000. The Navy is currently evaluating future DDG-51 and DDG-1000 production requirements. The group’s backlog at year-end 2008 also included $365 for a contract with U.S. Shipping Partners, L.P., for the remaining work in the construction of five product carriers under a potential nine-ship program. The five ships under contract are scheduled for delivery through 2011. The customer has indicated in public filings its reluctance to purchase ships six through nine. If the customer fails to exercise its options under the contract, we believe ample opportunity exists to remarket these ships. In addition, the Marine Systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately $3.5 billion in engineering, repair and overhaul programs. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Net sales $ 10,038 $ 9,622 $ 416 4.3 % Operating earnings 1,075 1,027 48 4.7 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.7 % The Information Systems and Technology group’s net sales exceeded $10 billion for the first time in 2008, with the most significant growth over 2007 coming from the group’s tactical and strategic mission systems business. The group’s increase in sales in 2008 was attributable to the following: U.S. defense $ 555 Commercial wireless (86 ) United Kingdom (53 ) Total increase in sales $ 416 The group’s U.S. defense market consists of the tactical and strategic mission systems, information technology (IT) and mission services, and intelligence mission systems businesses. The tactical and strategic mission systems business generated double-digit sales growth in 2008. This growth resulted from increased activity on several key U.S. military programs, such as the Warfighter Information Network – Tactical (WIN-T) program and the Common Hardware/Software III (CHS-3) program, as well as higher volume on the group’s ground-based satellite communications programs. The group provides fast, secure, mobile command-and-control capabilities to warfighters under WIN-T, and commercial and ruggedized computers, network equipment and software to the U.S. armed forces and other federal agencies worldwide under CHS-3. Sales were up in the group’s core IT services business due primarily to the ramp-up of activity on several new programs, including the group’s contract to provide technology operations and maintenance infrastructure support (TOMIS) services for the U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration and the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) contract. Under the Warfighter FOCUS program, the group provides support for the Army’s live, virtual and constructive training operations. Sales in the group’s intelligence mission systems business remained steady compared with 2007. The group’s commercial wireless operations experienced significantly lower activity in 2008 due to reduced demand in the market. However, sales in the commercial wireless business appeared to stabilize in the second half of 2008. Sales decreased in the group’s United Kingdom business due to a scheduled decline in activity on the BOWMAN communications program for the U.K. armed forces, offset in part by higher activity on other command, control, communications, computing and intelligence systems (C4I) programs. The BOWMAN program has reached a steady-state level of volume for the foreseeable future as the group continues ongoing logistics support and sustainment activity. The Information Systems and Technology group’s operating earnings increased at a rate consistent with sales growth. As a result, the group was able to maintain a 10.7 percent operating margin, equaling 2007 despite an increased proportion of lower-margin service work. We expect 8 percent sales growth in the Information Systems and Technology group in 2009 with contributions from each of the group’s businesses. We expect operating margins to be down 30 to 40 basis points compared with 2008 based on the scheduled contract mix in 2009. Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 9,622 $ 9,024 $ 598 6.6 % Operating earnings 1,027 976 51 5.2 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.8 % Sales in the Information Systems and Technology group improved in 2007 compared with 2006, and operating earnings topped $1 billion for the first time. The group experienced 11 percent organic growth in its core North American tactical and strategic mission systems and IT and 28 General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report Table of Contents mission services businesses. The strong performance in the tactical and strategic mission systems business was due to higher activity on programs such as Combat Operations Centers (COC), CHS-3 and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) as well as increased volume on the group’s ground-based satellite communications programs. The IT and mission services business benefited from the acquisition of Anteon International Corporation (Anteon) in June 2006 and higher volume in its core defense market on the strength of such programs as Intelligence Information, Command-and-Control Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2) and Network-Centric Solutions (NETCENTS). These increases were offset partially by an expected decline in volume on the U.K. BOWMAN program, reduced activity in the group’s intelligence mission systems business and a decline in activity in the commercial wireless market. The group’s operating margins were down by 10 basis points compared with 2006 due to the group’s shift to include more IT services content, including the acquisition of Anteon. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog grew 7 percent in 2008 to $10.2 billion at year end, reflecting a book-to-bill ratio (in dollars) of 1.12 for the year. The group’s funded backlog on December 31 increased slightly compared with 2007 to $7.2 billion, representing approximately 70 percent of the group’s total backlog. Unlike our other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts that have to be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards, and relatively few large-scale, long-term programs. Some of the more significant programs are highlighted below. The Army’s WIN-T program comprised over $790 of the group’s backlog at the end of 2008. Information Systems and Technology is the prime contractor on this battlefield communications network program that is designed to provide warfighters with fast, secure, mobile command-and-control capabilities. In 2008, the group received approximately $315 of awards for WIN-T, including a contract to provide specialized satellite communications earth terminals and technical support services for the first increment of the program. The group’s backlog at year end also included approximately $730 for the ICE2 program. ICE2 was the Information Systems and Technology group’s largest single program in 2008 and supports critical intelligence and command-and-control systems and networks for U.S. defense and intelligence operations worldwide. In 2008, the group received ICE2 orders of $960, bringing the total contract value since inception to $3.1 billion. Approximately $385 of the group’s backlog at year end was for the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP). Under the MHP program, the group provides integrated mission systems for 28 state-of-the-art helicopters that are intended to replace Canada’s aging fleet of marine helicopters. Other programs that made up a significant portion of the group’s year-end backlog include approximately $310 for CHS-3, $200 for NETCENTS and $190 for Rescue 21, the search-and-rescue system for the U.S. Coast Guard. The group received $565 in orders under CHS-3 and over $160 of orders under the Rescue 21 program in 2008. In addition to these programs, the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2008, including the following: • A contract from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency worth approximately $375 to plan, engineer, design, install, test and operate the agency’s IT infrastructure. The contract has a total potential value of approximately $970 if all options are exercised. • A contract worth approximately $265 for the system development and demonstration of the Integrated Computer System for the Army’s FCS program, bringing the total contract value to approximately $810. • A contract from the U.S. Marine Corps worth $133 to produce units of the next-generation Tactical Data Network (TDN)-Data Distribution Systems-Modular (DDS-M), which provides secure, networked communication capabilities for deployed forces. The contract has a total potential value of $375 if all options are exercised. • A contract worth $115 for design and implementation work on the next-generation Global Positioning System Space System program (GPS III) for the U.S. Air Force. • An award valued at $114 to develop and integrate the maritime and fixed-site joint tactical radio capabilities and provide information assurance services for the Airborne Maritime and Fixed Site (AMF) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). The contract has a potential value of over $150. • A $110 order to build the spacecraft for NASA’s Landsat Data Continuity Mission. The group is designing and fabricating the spacecraft as well as providing testing and on-orbit engineering support. The group’s backlog does not include approximately $10.3 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. The value of these arrangements may be realized over the next 13 years. In 2008, funding under IDIQ contracts and options contributed over $3.5 billion, more than 30 percent of the group’s orders, to the group’s backlog, most notably from ICE2, CHS-3 and WIN-T. Information Systems and Technology was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2008. The group was awarded a contract with a potential value of over $2 billion for the Warfighter FOCUS program. The group received approximately $215 in orders under this program in General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report 29 Table of Contents 2008. In addition, the group received an IDIQ contract from the Naval Air Systems Command with a potential value of over $180 for integrated logistics support for foreign military sales. CORPORATE Corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options and a portion of the earnings/cost from our commercial pension plans. Corporate operating expenses totaled $75 in 2008, $61 in 2007 and $47 in 2006. The increase in Corporate operating expense in 2008 and 2007 resulted primarily from increased stock option expense. (See Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our stock options.) We expect 2009 stock option expense of approximately $80 to $85. The impact of the commercial pension plans on Corporate’s earnings was not significant in the past three years, and we do not expect it to be significant in 2009. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In the mid-1990s, General Dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment, generating strong cash flow to enable a series of acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond our core platform businesses. These acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded our customer base. Since 1995, we have acquired 52 businesses for a total cost of almost $20 billion. These actions have resulted in a larger, more diversified company while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility. Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,110 $ 2,925 $ 2,128 Net cash used by investing activities (3,662 ) (852 ) (2,316 ) Net cash used by financing activities (718 ) (786 ) (539 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and equivalents (1,270 ) 1,287 (727 ) Cash and equivalents at beginning of year 2,891 1,604 2,331 Cash and equivalents at end of year 1,621 2,891 1,604 Marketable securities 143 168 – Short- and long-term debt (4,024 ) (2,791 ) (2,781 ) Net (debt) surplus (a) $ (2,260 ) $ 268 $ (1,177 ) Debt-to-equity (b) 40.0 % 23.7 % 28.3 % Debt-to-capital (c) 28.6 % 19.2 % 22.1 % (a) Net (debt) surplus is calculated as total debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities. (b) Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity. (c) Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total debt plus total equity. Our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks, commercial paper rated A1/P1 or higher, and repurchase agreements with direct obligations of the Spanish government as collateral. Our marketable securities balances are invested primarily in high-quality corporate, municipal and U.S. government-sponsored debt securities. The marketable securities have an average duration of two months and an average credit rating of AA+. We have not incurred any losses associated with these investments. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Operating Activities We generated cash from operating activities of $3.1 billion in 2008, $2.9 billion in 2007 and $2.1 billion in 2006. In each year, the two primary drivers of our cash flow were net earnings and increasing levels of customer deposits in the Aerospace group. In 2007, the cash flows from operating activities included the collection of approximately $270 of contract funds upon resolution of the Marine Systems group’s request for equitable adjustment on the T-AKE contract. In 2006, net earnings generated the majority of our operating cash flows, though approximately $150 of the net earnings related to a net gain on the sale of non-core businesses. The cash flow from these sales is reported in investing activities. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to our expectations, the default termination ultimately is sustained, we, along with The Boeing Company, could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2008. If this were the outcome, we would owe half of the total, or approximately $1.4 billion pretax. Our after-tax cash obligation would be approximately $690. We believe we have sufficient resources, including access to capital markets, to pay such an obligation, if required. Investing Activities We used $3.7 billion in 2008, $852 in 2007 and $2.3 billion in 2006 for investing activities. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures. In 2007 and 2006, these uses of cash were partially reduced by proceeds from divestiture activities. Business Acquisitions. In 2008, we completed five acquisitions for a total of $3.2 billion. In 2007, we completed four acquisitions for a total of $330. In 2006, we completed three acquisitions for a total of $2.3 billion. We financed these acquisitions using cash on hand and commercial paper. (See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions.) Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $490 in 2008, $474 in 2007 and $334 in 2006. The increase in 2008 over 2007 resulted from continued facility improvements in the Aerospace group, which are 30 General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report Table of Contents substantially complete. The increase in 2007 over 2006 resulted from facility improvements in the Aerospace and the Marine Systems groups. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $475 in 2009, less than 2 percent of sales. We had no material commitments for capital expenditures on December 31, 2008. Sale of Assets. In 2007, we sold our coal mining operation for approximately $25 in cash, net of taxes. In 2006, we sold our aggregates business for approximately $315 in cash, net of taxes. Available-for-Sale Securities. As a result of our strong cash position, we have expanded our investments in available-for-sale securities in recent years. Net sales of these securities were $17 in 2008 compared with net purchases of $179 in 2007 and $12 in 2006. Financing Activities We used $718 in 2008, $786 in 2007 and $539 in 2006 for financing activities. Our typical financing activities are issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises. Debt Proceeds, Net. On December 15, 2008, we issued $1 billion of five-year fixed-rate debt pursuant to a Form S-3 Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 on December 8, 2008. We used the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures, refinancing of existing indebtedness including commercial paper, and financing of acquisitions. We received net proceeds from commercial paper issuances in 2008 of $904, which were used primarily to fund business acquisitions. We had no commercial paper outstanding at the end of 2007 or 2006. We have approximately $2 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon. These facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program. In 2008, we repaid $500 of fixed-rate debt, $150 of senior notes and $20 of term debt on the scheduled maturity dates. There were no material debt repayments in 2007. In 2006, we repaid $500 of our fixed-rate debt on the scheduled maturity date. There are no material repayments of long-term debt scheduled until the third quarter of 2010. Dividends. Our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share on March 5, 2008, the 11th consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share in March 2007 and $0.23 per share in March 2006. Share Repurchases. In 2008, we repurchased 20 million of our outstanding shares on the open market. We repurchased 6.5 million shares in 2007 and 1.2 million shares in 2006 on the open market. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 4.9 million shares were authorized for repurchase by our board of directors – about 1 percent of our total shares outstanding. Non-GAAP Management Metrics Our management emphasizes the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. In 2008, for the tenth consecutive year, net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net earnings. We deployed this cash to complete acquisitions, continue our trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase our outstanding shares. As a result of this continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment, our return on invested capital (ROIC) increased by 160 basis points during 2008 to 18.5 percent. Our ROIC has grown 520 basis points since 2004. We believe ROIC is a useful measure for investors, because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. ROIC for 2004 through 2008 is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Earnings from continuing operations $ 2,478 $ 2,080 $ 1,710 $ 1,448 $ 1,194 After-tax interest expense 91 89 106 108 106 After-tax amortization expense 100 99 90 70 62 Net operating profit after taxes 2,669 2,268 1,906 1,626 1,362 Average debt and equity $ 14,390 $ 13,430 $ 12,220 $ 10,948 $ 10,249 Return on invested capital 18.5 % 16.9 % 15.6 % 14.9 % 13.3 % General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report 31 Table of Contents Our free cash flow from operations was $2.6 billion in 2008, $2.5 billion in 2007, $1.8 billion in each of 2006 and 2005, and $1.5 billion in 2004. We define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 3,124 $ 2,952 $ 2,156 $ 2,033 $ 1,760 Capital expenditures (490 ) (474 ) (334 ) (262 ) (253 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 2,634 $ 2,478 $ 1,822 $ 1,771 $ 1,507 Cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations 126 % 142 % 126 % 140 % 147 % Free cash flow from operations 106 % 119 % 107 % 122 % 126 % Over the past five years, we have generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of our earnings from continuing operations during the period, an average 115 percent conversion rate. We expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short- and long-term liquidity needs. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Off-balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2008, other than operating leases, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to our stock and classified in shareholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; or variable interests in entities that provide us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support or engage with us in leasing, hedging or research and development services. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2008: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 4,700 $ 1,040 $ 973 $ 1,213 $ 1,474 Capital lease obligations 2 1 1 — — Operating leases 1,081 205 304 167 405 Purchase obligations (b) 28,018 11,166 7,554 4,653 4,645 Other long-term liabilities (c) 12,337 1,930 1,963 1,558 6,886 $ 46,138 $ 14,342 $ 10,795 $ 7,591 $ 13,410 (a) Includes scheduled interest payments.

(b) Includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. This amount includes $21.6 billion of purchase orders for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we have full recourse under normal contract termination clauses. As disclosed in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we expect to make approximately $260 of contributions to our retirement plans in 2009. This amount has been excluded from the above amount. (c) Represents other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including the current portion of long-term liabilities. The projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management's estimates, which are largely based on historical experience. This amount also includes all liabilities under our defined-benefit retirement plans, as discussed in Note Q. See Note Q for information regarding the plan assets available to satisfy these liabilities. Retirement plan assets and liabilities are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a plan-by-plan basis. 32 General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report Table of Contents Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period Commercial Commitments Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years Letters of credit* $ 1,554 $ 837 $ 30 $ 242 $ 445 Trade-in options* 141 93 48 — — $ 1,695 $ 930 $ 78 $ 242 $ 445 * See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of letters of credit and aircraft trade-in options. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to long-term contracts and programs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers’ compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft inventory, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition. We account for sales and earnings in our defense and aerospace businesses using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize contract revenue as the work progresses – either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered, as applicable. We estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input measures (e.g., costs incurred) or output measures (e.g., contract milestones or units delivered), as appropriate to the circumstances. Where an interim output measure is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion, we use such output measures. Otherwise, we use input measures. We generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion or based on unit deliveries under the contract. Our contracts for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft usually provide for two major phases: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft (i.e., before exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics) and its completion. We record revenue at two contractual milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. We do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer and other factors. We follow the guidelines of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts. However, we include revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the reallocation method, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes (which has been superseded by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections), rather than the cumulative catch-up method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term, while under the cumulative catch-up method such impact would be recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the loss in the period it is identified. Anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts, including G&A expenses on government contracts. We use the reallocation method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates of total contract revenue, total costs or the extent of progress toward completion on our long-term contracts affect both the period in which the change is identified and future periods. We believe these changes generally reflect expectations as to future performance and, therefore, the reallocation method is the method that best matches our revenues and earnings in the periods in which they are earned. While we have applied this method consistently for more than 30 years, most contractors use the cumulative catch-up method. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications. Contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the timing of product deliveries. These estimates are based on our best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report 33 Table of Contents of our contracts. We review our contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflect changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method. We recognize revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We recognize revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. Estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance. Goodwill. Since 1995, we have acquired 52 businesses at a total cost of almost $20 billion, including five in 2008. In connection with these acquisitions, we have recognized $11.4 billion of goodwill. Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process that requires a significant level of estimation by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. These estimates require the use of judgment. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations. This requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business, and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows. This discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by “top-down” analyses, including a market assessment of our enterprise value. Beyond the annual impairment test, factors that may lead us to perform a goodwill impairment test include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. We have recorded no goodwill impairment to date and do not anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to an impairment in the foreseeable future. Commitments and Contingencies. We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. We record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally when they are paid. As permitted by AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Federal Government Contractors, we have elected to defer (or inventory) these costs in contracts in process until they are paid, at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government. We expect to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. This business base includes numerous contracts for which we are the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on our best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. Our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. We determine the long-term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, future pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. The following hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our commercial pension and post-retirement benefit plans would have had the following impact on 2008: Increase 25 bps Decrease 25 bps Increase (decrease) to net pension cost from: Change in discount rate $ (2 ) $ 3 Change in long-term rate of return on plan assets (3 ) 3 Increase (decrease) to post-retirement benefit cost from: Change in discount rate $ (1 ) $ 1 Change in long-term rate of return on plan assets (1 ) 1 As discussed under Deferred Contract Costs, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of contributions to our government retirement plans. As permitted by AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Federal Government Contractors, we have elected to defer recognition of the cumulative net unfunded benefit cost in our government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. As such, the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that 34 General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report Table of Contents results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our future earnings either positively or negatively. We believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. New Accounting Standards In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities – An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS 161 expands and enhances required disclosures related to derivatives and hedging instruments. SFAS 161 is effective in the first quarter of 2009. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 161 to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements – An Amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS 160 establishes new accounting for noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective in the first quarter of 2009. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations. SFAS 141R changes the requirements for accounting for business combinations, including the determination of purchase price and assignment of purchase price to acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The primary effect of SFAS 141R is to increase earnings volatility associated with business combinations, including a requirement to charge acquisition and restructuring costs to earnings rather than including the costs in the purchase price, and a modification of the guidelines for recognizing intangible assets, which may increase the value assigned to intangible assets and the resulting amortization expense associated with future acquisitions. SFAS 141R is effective for our acquisitions that are completed after December 31, 2008. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. Foreign Currency Risk Our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and certain inter-company transactions denominated in currencies other than our (or one of our subsidiaries’) functional currency. We may enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to fix, or limit the adverse impact on, the amount of firmly committed and forecasted non-functional payments, receipts and inter-company transactions related to our ongoing business and operational financing activities. These contracts are designed to minimize our risk when we enter into transactions outside our functional currency. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. On December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $2.4 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, in notional forward and option contracts outstanding. A 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental recognized pretax loss of $12 in 2008 and $29 in 2007, and an incremental unrecognized pretax loss of $112 in 2008 and $53 in 2007. This exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the U.S. dollar/ Canadian dollar, euro/Swiss franc, pound sterling/euro and U.S. dollar/euro exchange rates. We believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. We believe these forward and option contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. Interest Rate Risk Financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations, variable-rate commercial paper and short-term investments. On December 31, 2008, we had $3.1 billion par value of fixed-rate debt and $905 in commercial paper outstanding. Our fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable, and we do not trade these securities in the market. A 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations. We have credit facilities with major banks of $1 billion expiring in July 2009 and $975 expiring in December 2011. These facilities are required by rating agencies to support the A1/P1 rating of our commercial paper issuances. We may renew or replace, in whole or in part, the facility that expires in July 2009. Commodity Price Risk We are also subject to risk of rising labor and commodity prices, primarily on long-term fixed-price contracts. To the extent possible, we include terms in our contracts that are designed to protect us from this risk. Some of the protective terms included in our contracts are considered derivatives but are not accounted for separately because they are clearly and closely related to the host contract. We have not entered into commodity hedging contracts but may do so as circumstances warrant. We do not believe that changes in labor or commodity prices will have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. Investment Risk Our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of five years. We held $1.8 billion in cash and equivalents and marketable securities to be used for general corporate purposes on December 31, 2008. Our marketable securities have an average duration of two months and an average credit rating of AA+. Given that our investments had an aggregate weighted average maturity of 23 days as of December 31, 2008, a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings in either year. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates or market values.

40533,GD,GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP,2010,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (For an overview of our business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW General Dynamics offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; shipbuilding design, repair and construction; and information systems, technologies and services. We operate through four business groups – Aerospace, Combat Systems, Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology. Our primary customers are the U.S. military, other U.S. government organizations, the armed forces of other nations, and a diverse base of corporate, government and individual buyers of business aircraft. We operate in two primary markets: defense and national security, and business aviation. The majority of our revenues derive from contracts with the U.S. military. The nation’s engagement in combating terrorism around the world, coupled with the need to grow and modernize U.S. military forces, has driven Department of Defense funding levels since 2001. In particular, procurement and research and development (R&D) budgets, also known as investment accounts, provide the majority of our revenues. For fiscal year 2010, the Congress appropriated $531 billion for the Department of Defense, including approximately $185 billion for procurement and R&D. Budget expenditures generally lag congressional funding, and we expect that expenditures applied toward programs over the next few years will be consistent with defense funding appropriated in recent years. To fund the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, defense budgets have also included supplemental funding. While some of our programs have received supplemental funds, most of our funding is now derived from base budgets. For fiscal year 2010, the Congress has appropriated approximately $130 billion in supplemental funding, including approximately 20 percent for investment accounts. The Defense Department has requested another $33 billion of supplemental funding in 2010. If this second supplemental is approved, defense funding for fiscal year 2010 will total approximately $693 billion. For fiscal year 2011, the President has requested total defense funding of $708 billion, including $159 billion in supplemental funding. The 2011 budget requests $189 billion for investment accounts, an increase of 2 percent over the fiscal year 2010 appropriation, including a nearly 8 percent increase in procurement funding. In February 2010, the Department of Defense published the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), an analysis of military priorities that shapes defense funding over the ensuing four years. This review reiterated the need for the military to prepare for a broad range of security challenges, and it prioritized continued investment in warfighting capabilities served by our portfolio of defense programs. The Pentagon’s five-year spending plan, also submitted to the Congress in February, reflects the slow, steady growth requirements set forth in the QDR. Through 2015, the base defense budget is expected to grow at a low-single-digit rate. Investment accounts are also projected to display low-single-digit inflation-adjusted growth, with procurement funding for mature programs growing and R&D funding for new programs declining over the period. This five-year plan also forecasts a reduction in future supplemental funding levels consistent with the administration’s plan to reduce troop levels in Iraq, offset somewhat by an increased footprint in Afghanistan. Our future growth in the U.S. defense market is driven by the size and allocation of the defense budget, the diversity of our exposure to different programs and customers within the budget, our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment, and our successful execution of the contracts we are awarded. While the landscape will continue to evolve in conjunction with dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, we expect defense funding to continue to be driven by the following: • support for the warfighter from the administration and the Congress in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment; • the number of troops deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq, coupled with the increase in the overall size of the U.S. military; • the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001; • the need to maintain thousands of jobs that support the health of our nation’s military infrastructure; and • the need to modernize that infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern-day warfare. Beyond the U.S. defense market, governments around the world continue to fund weapons and equipment modernization programs, leading to significant defense export opportunities. We are committed to pursuing opportunities presented by international demand for military hardware and information technologies. While the revenue potential can be significant, international defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing, changing priorities and overall spending pressures. As we broaden the customer base for our defense products around the world, we expect our international sales and exports to grow. The deterioration in the global economic environment in late 2008 and early 2009 significantly impacted the business-aviation market. Difficult economic conditions, tight credit markets and negative business-jet rhetoric General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report 19 Table of Contents in the first half of 2009 caused new-aircraft orders to decline, customers to default on aircraft contracts and pre-owned aircraft inventories to grow. Business-jet market conditions began to improve in the second half of 2009, in line with the broader financial market recovery. Improved flying hours, increased new-aircraft order interest, particularly for large-cabin aircraft, abating customer defaults and higher aircraft service activity helped to stabilize our Aerospace business. Barring any further economic turmoil, we believe the diversity and duration of our business-jet order book positions the Aerospace group for further improvement in 2010. Continued investment in new aircraft products is expected to drive the Aerospace group’s long-term growth, particularly when it begins delivering its newest aircraft offerings, the G250 (scheduled to enter service in 2011) and the G650 (scheduled to enter service in 2012). Similarly, we believe that aircraft-service revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by continued growth in the global installed business-jet fleet. We are committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices, disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements. Our solid performance is measured in our sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow. General Dynamics’ record as an industry leader in cash-flow generation has provided us the flexibility to execute our operational strategy and enabled us consistently to deploy resources to further enhance shareholder returns through acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchases. CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW The following discussion of our results of operations is based on operating performance at the business group level. The disclosures focus on the material financial measures we use to evaluate the performance of each of our four business groups, including revenues, operating earnings and margins, cash flow, and orders and backlog. For the defense business groups, the discussion of results of operations is based on specific contracts and programs that drive the group’s results rather than types of products and services, which often comprise multiple contracts with different customers. For the Aerospace group, the results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services, consistent with how the group is managed. In the defense business groups, the majority of the revenues are generated by long-term government contracts. As discussed further in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section, we account for revenues under these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this method, revenue is recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered. As a result, changes in revenues are generally discussed in terms of volume. Volume indicates increases or decreases in revenues due to changes in production or construction activity levels, delivery schedules or levels of services on individual contracts. In the Aerospace group, we recognize revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. Sales contracts for new aircraft have two major phases: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s completion, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics. We record revenues on these contracts at two milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the aircraft. Revenues in the Aerospace group’s aircraft outfitting and services businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of the service, similar to our defense businesses. Changes in revenues in this group result from the number of new aircraft deliveries (both green and completion), the progress toward completion of aircraft outfitting activities, the level of service activity during the period and the number of pre-owned aircraft sold. Operating earnings and margins in the defense business groups are discussed in terms of changes in revenue volume, performance, the mix of contracts (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) and the phases of work within those contracts (e.g., development/production). Performance refers to changes in contract earnings rates during the term of the contract based on revisions to estimates of profit at completion on individual contracts. These revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract and/or the estimated costs required to complete the contract. The following discussion of results provides additional disclosure to the extent that a material or unusual event causes a change in the profitability of a contract. In general, operating earnings and margins in the Aerospace group are a function of the prices we charge for our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and completing the aircraft, and the mix of aircraft deliveries among the higher-margin large-cabin and lower-margin mid-size aircraft. Additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margins include the volume and profitability of services work performed, the number and type of pre-owned aircraft sold, and the level of general and administrative costs incurred by the group, which include selling expenses and research and development costs.

The Combat Systems group generated the strongest revenue growth from higher volume in its U.S. and European military vehicle programs and the acquisition of AxleTech International in December 2008. The Marine Systems group’s revenues were up significantly because of increased activity on U.S. Navy and commercial shipbuilding and repair programs across our shipyards. In the Information Systems and Technology group, increased volume in each of the group’s U.S. operations and recent acquisitions drove the group’s revenue growth. Revenues decreased in the Aerospace group in 2009 following our decision to cut aircraft production and deliveries – principally mid-size aircraft – in response to a significant downturn in the business-jet market in the first half of the year. This decline was offset partially by the acquisition of Jet Aviation in November 2008. Our operating earnings increased slightly in 2009 over 2008. Earnings growth in each of our defense businesses was mostly offset by reduced earnings in Aerospace. Operating margins were up significantly in the Marine Systems group because of improved operating performance at each of our shipyards during the year. In the Information Systems and Technology group, margins remained consistent with those achieved in 2008. A shift in contract mix in the Combat Systems group led to reduced margins compared with the prior year. The Aerospace group’s margins were reduced by a five-week furlough at the group’s aircraft assembly operations in the third quarter of 2009, losses associated with pre-owned aircraft activities and the addition of lower-margin business at Jet Aviation. As a result, our overall operating margins decreased by 100 basis points in 2009 compared with 2008. Review of 2008 vs. 2007 Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Revenues $ 29,300 $ 27,240 $ 2,060 7.6 % Operating earnings 3,653 3,113 540 17.3 % Operating margin 12.5 % 11.4 % We generated solid revenue growth in 2008 compared with 2007, and operating earnings increased at more than twice the rate of revenue growth. The Aerospace and Marine Systems groups achieved the most significant jump in revenues as a result of increases in business-jet deliveries and higher activity on shipbuilding programs. Revenues increased in the Combat Systems group due to strong demand for U.S. military vehicles and related support services. Higher activity in tactical and strategic mission systems contributed the majority of the revenue growth in the Information Systems and Technology group. Our operating earnings increased significantly in 2008, and three of our four business groups reported earnings in excess of $1 billion. Growth in operating earnings exceeded the revenue growth in each of our business groups due to strong program execution and a continued focus on operating performance. Overall, our operating margins increased 110 basis points to 12.5 percent in 2008. Cash Flow Cash flows from operations in 2009 exceeded net earnings for the 11th consecutive year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion in 2009, $3.1 billion in 2008 and $3 billion in 2007. Over the three-year period, we deployed our cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase our common stock, pay dividends and repay maturing debt. Our net debt – debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities – was $1.2 billion at year-end 2009 compared with $2.3 billion at the end of 2008. This $1.1 billion decrease in net debt was achieved after the following capital deployments: $811 spent on acquisitions, $577 of dividends paid, $520 of company-sponsored research and development, $385 of capital expenditures, approximately $330 of contributions to our retirement plans and $209 of share repurchases during the year. General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report 21 Table of Contents Other Financial Information General and administrative (G&A) expenses as a percentage of revenues were 6.1 percent in 2009, 5.9 percent in 2008 and 6 percent in 2007. G&A expenses were $2 billion in 2009, $1.7 billion in 2008 and $1.6 billion in 2007. We expect 2010 G&A to be approximately 6 percent of revenues. Net interest expense increased to $160 in 2009 compared with $66 in 2008 and $70 in 2007 due to the issuance of additional debt in 2008 and 2009 and lower interest income, reflecting lower market interest rates and a reduced invested cash balance during the year. We expect net interest expense of approximately $150 in 2010, subject to capital deployment activities during the year. Our effective tax rate was 31.5 percent in 2009, 31.2 percent in 2008 and 31.7 percent in 2007. The 2008 rate included a $35, or approximately $0.09 per-share, benefit from the settlement of tax refund litigation, which reduced the 2008 tax rate by 100 basis points. Our effective tax rate in 2007 was impacted favorably by the resolution of our 2003 to 2004 federal income tax audit with the Internal Revenue Service. This settlement resulted in a benefit of $18, or approximately $0.04 per share, which reduced our effective tax rate by 60 basis points. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 31.5 to 32 percent in 2010. For additional discussion of tax matters, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Discontinued Operations In 2008, we entered into an agreement to sell our Spanish nitrocellulose operation and recognized a pretax loss of $11 in discontinued operations in anticipation of the sale. We are awaiting Spanish government approval and expect the sale to close in 2010. In 2007, we completed the sale of our coal mining operation and received proceeds of approximately $25. Our reported revenues exclude the revenues associated with these divested businesses. We have presented their operating results, along with the gains and losses from the transactions discussed above, as discontinued operations, net of income taxes. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value Our total backlog was $65.5 billion at the end of 2009 compared to $74.1 billion at year-end 2008. Funded backlog was $45.9 billion at year end, down from $51.7 billion at the end of 2008. We received $26.4 billion of new orders in 2009. The Information Systems and Technology group’s orders were particularly strong in 2009, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by revenues) greater than one-to-one for the second consecutive year. Combat Systems also had another strong order year, driven in part by growing international order activity late in the year. The total backlog for our defense businesses decreased in 2009 to $46.2 billion at the end of the year, compared with $51.6 billion at the end of 2008. The defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. About three-quarters of the decline in our defense backlog during 2009 was in Marine Systems, which traditionally receives large, multi-year awards and works down that backlog in subsequent periods. The funded portion of the defense backlog was $27 billion at the end of 2009, down from $29.9 billion in December 2008. This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, we have included in the backlog only firm contracts we believe are likely to receive funding. The Aerospace group’s total backlog was $19.3 billion at the end of 2009 following a record level of $22.5 billion at year-end 2008. Aerospace funded backlog was $18.9 billion at the end of 2009 compared to $21.9 billion at the end of 2008. Aerospace funded backlog represents orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. The Aerospace unfunded backlog of $433 at the end of 2009 consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. Our backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft, which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value. Customers use IDIQ contracts when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed. These agreements, which set forth the majority of the contractual terms, including prices, are funded as delivery orders are placed. A significant portion of our estimated potential contract value includes our estimate of the value we will receive under multiple-award IDIQ contracts in which we are one of several companies competing for task orders. The estimated contract value also includes IDIQ contracts for which we have been designated as the sole-source supplier to design, develop, produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies. We believe the customers intend to fully implement these systems. Because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer’s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders, we recognize these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. 22 General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report Table of Contents Contract options in our defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts, if the customer exercises the option. These options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date. Contract options in the Aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft and long-term agreements with fleet customers. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. On December 31, 2009, the estimated potential value associated with these IDIQ contracts and contract options was approximately $17.6 billion, up from $16.8 billion at the end of 2008. This represents our estimate of the potential value we will receive. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower. We expect to realize this value over the next 10 to 15 years. REVIEW OF OPERATING SEGMENTS AEROSPACE Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 Variance Revenues $ 5,171 $ 5,512 $ (341 ) (6.2 )% Operating earnings 707 1,021 (314 ) (30.8 )% Operating margin 13.7 % 18.5 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 94 156 (62 ) (39.7 )% Completion 110 152 (42 ) (27.6 )% The Aerospace group’s revenues decreased in 2009, the net result of a 24 percent decline in Gulfstream revenues that was offset in part by revenues from Jet Aviation, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2008. The combination of the global economic deterioration and credit crisis along with negative business-jet rhetoric had a significant impact on the business-jet market in 2009. To adjust to the economic conditions and weakened demand, we reduced Gulfstream’s 2009 aircraft production and delivery schedule, primarily in the group’s mid-size models, to bridge the market downturn. This included a five-week furlough at the group’s production center in Savannah, Georgia, in July and August. As a result, aircraft-manufacturing revenues decreased 28 percent in 2009 compared with 2008. The economic environment also impacted the group’s aircraft services business. Organic aircraft-services revenues were down 15 percent in 2009 resulting from reduced flying hours and customer deferral of aircraft maintenance. The decline in aircraft manufacturing and services revenues was slightly offset by higher pre-owned aircraft revenues in 2009. The group sold six pre-owned aircraft for $124 in 2009 compared with two sales for $18 in 2008. The group’s operating earnings declined in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to the factors noted above. The components of the reduction in earnings were as follows: Aircraft manufacturing and completions $ (220 ) Pre-owned aircraft (18 ) Aircraft services 1 Other (77 ) Total decrease in operating earnings $ (314 ) The net decrease in the group’s aircraft manufacturing and completions earnings in 2009 resulted from the reduction in Gulfstream aircraft deliveries offset in part by the addition of Jet Aviation’s aircraft completions and refurbishing business. The earnings decline associated with the decreased Gulfstream volume was mitigated by cost-reduction initiatives, a shift in the mix of aircraft deliveries toward large-cabin aircraft, and liquidated damages collected on defaulted aircraft contracts. As a result, aircraft manufacturing margins increased in 2009 over 2008 despite the decline in volume during the year. The group continues to focus on reducing costs through production improvements and operational efficiencies to maintain aircraft-manufacturing margins. In late 2008 and early 2009, the supply in the global pre-owned aircraft market increased significantly, putting considerable pressure on pricing. As a result, the group wrote down the carrying value of its pre-owned aircraft inventory in 2009. Pricing in the pre-owned market appears to have stabilized in the second half of 2009, particularly for large-cabin aircraft. The group continues to work to minimize its pre-owned aircraft exposure, with four pre-owned aircraft valued at $60 remaining in inventory at the end of 2009. Aircraft services earnings were steady in 2009 compared with 2008 as the addition of Jet Aviation’s maintenance and repair activities, fixed-base operations and aircraft management services offset a decrease in organic aircraft services earnings. A significant reduction in flight hours in the business-jet market put competitive pressure on aircraft maintenance and repair earnings in 2009. The group’s operating earnings also were impacted negatively in 2009 by severance costs associated with workforce reduction activities and intangible asset amortization related to the Jet Aviation acquisition. The factors discussed above and the addition of lower-margin Jet Aviation business caused the group’s overall operating margins to decrease 480 basis points in 2009 compared with 2008. General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report 23 Table of Contents Review of 2008 vs. 2007 Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Revenues $ 5,512 $ 4,828 $ 684 14.2 % Operating earnings 1,021 810 211 26.0 % Operating margin 18.5 % 16.8 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 156 138 18 13.0 % Completion 152 138 14 10.1 % The Aerospace group generated significant revenue growth in 2008, attributable primarily to increased aircraft deliveries compared with 2007. New aircraft revenues were up 12 percent in 2008 as a result of the increased aircraft production. Aircraft services volume increased 8 percent over 2007. The acquisition of Jet Aviation in November 2008 contributed approximately one-quarter of the group’s increase in revenues. The group’s pre-owned aircraft revenues were $18 in 2008, down from $78 in 2007. The Aerospace group’s operating earnings increased at a significantly higher rate than revenues in 2008. Approximately $157 of the earnings growth resulted from higher new-aircraft and aircraft-services volume. Improved pricing, a favorable delivery mix and productivity improvements in the aircraft assembly and outfitting processes increased earnings by approximately $105. Reduced sales of pre-owned aircraft and write-downs of pre-owned aircraft inventory reduced the group’s earnings growth by $25. Increased selling expenses from strong order activity and higher product-development costs associated with the introduction of two new aircraft models in 2008 also reduced the group’s earnings growth by $26. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The economic turmoil of late 2008 and early 2009 had a significant impact on the business-jet market. The collapse of the global economy led some customers in the backlog to default on their contracts and caused some prospective customers to delay aircraft orders. Both the large-cabin and mid-size segments experienced a decline in orders in late 2008 and early 2009. However, the mid-size market experienced the greatest impact. Large-cabin orders improved steadily throughout the year. Excluding the introduction of the new G650, large-cabin orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 reached their highest level since the second quarter of 2008. Despite the rebound in order activity resulting in a full-year book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by revenues) greater than one-to-one, the customer defaults led to a 14 percent decline in the group’s backlog from the end of 2008. The Aerospace group ended 2009 with $19.3 billion of backlog, of which $18.9 billion was funded. Scheduled large-cabin deliveries are sold out through 2010 and well into 2011. Conditions in the mid-size market remain challenging. However, these aircraft represent a declining proportion of our portfolio. We continually assess aircraft production requirements and will modify the group’s production and delivery schedule as necessary based on the state of the backlog and the business-jet market. Over the past few years, the group’s customer base has become increasingly diverse, both in customer type and geographic region. The group’s year-end backlog is divided approximately evenly among public companies, private companies and individual buyers. No one customer represents more than 1 percent of the group’s backlog. In addition, the backlog has shifted toward the international market, with customers outside North America comprising almost 60 percent of the backlog. The Aerospace backlog has also been diversified to include orders for the group’s newest aircraft models – the G650 and the G250. Both of these aircraft were introduced in 2008 and achieved their scheduled first flight in the fourth quarter of 2009. Initial green deliveries for each are scheduled to begin in 2011. The backlog does not include options to purchase new aircraft or long-term agreements with fleet customers. These arrangements totaled $1.4 billion at the end of 2009 and are included in estimated potential contract value. 2010 Outlook We expect a low- to mid-single-digit percentage increase in the Aerospace group’s revenues in 2010 compared with 2009. We expect to deliver approximately the same number of aircraft, with a further shift toward the large-cabin models. We also anticipate a modest increase in aircraft services activity in 2010. Based on the favorable mix of aircraft deliveries and the stabilization of the pre-owned aircraft market, tempered by the pace of ongoing operational improvement efforts at Jet Aviation, we expect the Aerospace group’s margins to improve slightly over 2009 to approximately 14 percent. These expectations do not assume any recovery in the mid-size market in 2010. 24 General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report Table of Contents COMBAT SYSTEMS Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 Variance Revenues $ 9,645 $ 8,194 $ 1,451 17.7 % Operating earnings 1,262 1,111 151 13.6 % Operating margin 13.1 % 13.6 % The Combat Systems group’s revenues increased significantly in 2009 compared with 2008. The increase in revenues was driven by 12.5 percent organic growth and the acquisition of AxleTech International in December 2008. The group received strong contributions to this growth from each of its markets: U.S. military vehicles $ 774 Weapons systems and munitions 532 European military vehicles 145 Total increase in revenues $ 1,451 Increased volume on the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle and Abrams main battle tank programs generated over half of the group’s revenue growth in 2009. The higher Stryker activity was due to increased vehicle production and modernization work. Under the Abrams program, the group continued to upgrade M1A1 tanks to the M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP) configuration for the U.S. Army and produced more Abrams tank kits for Egypt. The revenue growth in the U.S. military vehicles business was tempered somewhat by lower volume on the group’s mine-resistant, ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicle deliveries, which were completed in the second quarter of 2009. Organic revenues were up in the group’s weapons systems and munitions businesses due to increased production of armor kits for Stryker vehicles, an increase in deliveries of Hydra-70 rockets and higher volume on munitions supply contracts for the United States and Canada. The group’s European military vehicle business generated strong revenue growth in 2009. Revenues increased as a result of higher activity on several wheeled armored vehicle production programs, including the Piranha for Belgium and Spain and the Eagle for Germany. Volume also increased on the group’s European arms and munitions and mobile bridge programs, while activity was down on the Leopard tank program with the Spanish government. The Combat Systems group’s operating earnings grew in 2009, though at a lower rate than revenues, resulting in a 50 basis-point decrease in operating margins compared with 2008. The group’s margins in 2008 were unusually high because of a favorable program mix in the U.S. military vehicles business. Review of 2008 vs. 2007 Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Revenues $ 8,194 $ 7,797 $ 397 5.1 % Operating earnings 1,111 916 195 21.3 % Operating margin 13.6 % 11.7 % In 2008, the Combat Systems group’s revenues were up compared with 2007 due to strength in the group’s U.S. military vehicles business. The majority of the revenue growth was generated by higher activity on the MRAP vehicle program, which emerged in late 2007, and several contracts in support of the group’s Abrams main battle tank modernization efforts, including the SEP upgrade and repair and reset work for battle-damaged M1 tanks. Revenues in the group’s weapons systems business decreased in 2008 due to fewer deliveries of systems that help protect U.S. combat forces from improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Revenues increased slightly on the group’s munitions programs over 2007. In the group’s European military vehicles business, volume was lower during the year on several international military vehicle programs, including the Leopard tank program. The group’s operating earnings grew significantly in 2008, increasing at more than four times the rate of revenue growth during the year. While the most significant driver of the group’s earnings growth was improved performance in the U.S. military vehicle business, particularly on the MRAP and Abrams programs, each of the group’s businesses generated at least a 100 basis-point increase in margins in 2008. The operating leverage achieved across Combat Systems’ operations in 2008 produced an overall 190 basis-point improvement in the group’s operating margins compared with 2007. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Combat Systems group’s total backlog was $13.4 billion at the end of 2009, down 10 percent from $15 billion at year-end 2008. Funded backlog decreased 6 percent in 2009 to $11.4 billion at year end. Approximately $930, or 60 percent, of the year-over-year decline in the group’s backlog is attributable to the Army’s termination for convenience of the manned ground vehicle portion of the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program. The Army currently is considering its alternatives for ground combat General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report 25 Table of Contents vehicle requirements, which we expect will provide additional opportunities for Combat Systems, including the addition of an eighth Stryker Brigade. The group received $8.6 billion of new orders in 2009. The group’s backlog consists primarily of long-term production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through 2015. The group’s backlog at the end of 2009 included approximately $2.8 billion for M1 Abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs. These include the M1A2 SEP, System Technical Support (STS) and Tank Urban Survivability Kit (TUSK) programs. Under the SEP program, we retrofit Abrams main battle tanks with improved electronics, command-and-control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank’s effectiveness. The group continued work in 2009 on a multi-year contract awarded in 2008 to upgrade the remaining M1A1 Abrams tanks to the SEP configuration. Approximately 50 percent of the group’s Abrams backlog at year end was for the SEP program. Under the STS program, we identify improvements and replace obsolete parts on Abrams tanks to maintain the tanks at high operational readiness rates. TUSK is a technological upgrade that improves the effectiveness of the tank in urban warfare environments. At year end, the Abrams backlog included a combined $620 for the STS and TUSK programs. In 2009, the group received awards from the Army totaling $580 for all Abrams-related programs, including awards to build M1A1 Situational Awareness (SA) tanks for the Iraqi army and for M1A2 upgrades for Saudi Arabia. The Army’s Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program comprised over $2 billion of the group’s backlog at year end, including the production of approximately 700 vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2012. The group received over $2.1 billion of Stryker orders in 2009, including awards worth approximately $930 for vehicle production, $590 for contractor logistics support and $500 for Stryker modernization. In January 2010, the Army awarded the group a contract worth an additional $85 for battle-damage assessment, repair services and materials for Stryker brigades deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. In February 2010, the Army awarded the group an additional $250 to continue Stryker logistics support and requested funds to establish an additional Stryker Brigade Combat Team. Almost $500 of the group’s backlog at the end of 2009 was for the U.S. Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program. The group is building seven new prototypes under the system design and development phase of the EFV program, which the group expects to deliver in 2010. The Combat Systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog. The backlog at the end of the year included: • $1.8 billion for Light Armored Vehicles under a Foreign Military Sale (FMS) contract through the Army, • $650 for the production of 190 Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles scheduled for delivery to the Spanish army through 2015, • $425 for Pandur vehicles for an international customer, • $330 for the production of 90 Pandur II vehicles for the Czech Republic, • $240 from the Swiss government to provide 232 Duro wheeled armored personnel vehicles, • $170 for a contract with the government of Belgium for 82 Piranha wheeled military vehicles and • $170 for the production of 64 Leopard 2E battle tanks, which the group produces for the Spanish army using a design licensed from a German company. In addition, Combat Systems was selected in 2009 as the prime contractor and systems integrator for the Canadian government’s LAV III upgrade program. The program has a potential value of $850, and we expect to receive a contract in 2010. The Combat Systems group’s backlog at year end also included approximately $2.6 billion in weapons systems, munitions, detection systems and composite-structures programs. In 2009, the group received awards totaling $210 for the production of Hydra-70 rockets, bringing the total contract value to date to over $1 billion. The group also received awards worth approximately $115 from the Canadian government to supply various calibers of training and tactical ammunition and $75 from the Army for production of M2HB machine guns. 2010 Outlook We expect 4 to 5 percent revenue growth in Combat Systems in 2010 attributable largely to international vehicle contracts and to growing activity in U.S. armament and munitions programs. We anticipate a slight decline in the group’s operating margins to the high-12 percent range due to a shift in program mix, including the start-up of several new contracts. MARINE SYSTEMS Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 Variance Revenues $ 6,363 $ 5,556 $ 807 14.5 % Operating earnings 642 521 121 23.2 % Operating margin 10.1 % 9.4 % Each of the Marine Systems group’s shipyards contributed to the group’s strong growth in revenues and operating earnings in 2009 over the prior year. The increase in revenues consisted of the following: Multi-year Navy ship construction $ 552 Other Navy ship design, construction, engineering and repair 229 Commercial ship construction 26 Total increase in revenues $ 807 The group’s multi-year ship-construction programs for the U.S. Navy include Virginia-class submarines, T-AKE combat-logistics ships and 26 General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report Table of Contents DDG-51 and DDG-1000 destroyers. The Virginia-class program contributed almost two-thirds of the group’s increase in revenues. The group delivered the sixth boat under the program in 2009 and continued construction on the next five of the remaining 12 boats under contract. Virginia activity is expected to continue to ramp up as the group moves toward construction of two ships per year starting in 2011 with deliveries scheduled through 2018. Activity was down slightly on the T-AKE program in 2009 as the group continued construction on the ninth through 12th ships. The group delivered the seventh and eighth ships in 2009, and deliveries of the remaining four ships awarded to date are scheduled through 2011 with ships 13 and 14 in 2012. On the destroyer programs, revenues were up in 2009 as activity increased significantly on the group’s design and production contracts for the DDG-1000 next-generation destroyer, while volume on the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class program decreased, consistent with our expectations. The first DDG-1000 delivery is scheduled in 2014, and the remaining three DDG-51 destroyers under contract are scheduled for delivery through 2011. In addition to these ship-construction programs, volume was up significantly in 2009 on engineering and repair programs for the Navy. The growing service requirements of the Navy’s aging fleet, along with the rebalancing of the fleet to position more ships on the West Coast, generated significant additional repair volume for our West Coast operations. The group’s commercial shipbuilding activity consists of a five-ship product carrier program. Activity on this program increased slightly in 2009 as the first three ships were delivered and construction continued on the remaining two ships, which are scheduled for delivery in 2010. The Marine Systems group’s operating earnings increased significantly in 2009. Each of the group’s shipyards has focused on operational efficiency and achieved significant labor and material cost reductions during the year. These efforts resulted in higher earnings rates on several key programs in 2009, including the Virginia-class, DDG-51, DDG-1000 and commercial product carrier programs. As a result, the group’s operating margins increased 70 basis points over 2008 to 10.1 percent. The group’s significant improvement in 2009 followed a 100-basis point increase in margins in 2008 over 2007. Review of 2008 vs. 2007 Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Revenues $ 5,556 $ 4,993 $ 563 11.3 % Operating earnings 521 421 100 23.8 % Operating margin 9.4 % 8.4 % Revenues in the Marine Systems group were up in 2008 as a result of increased activity at each of the group’s shipyards. Activity increased on the Virginia-class program as the group delivered the fourth and fifth boats in the program in 2008. Volume also increased on the T-AKE and DDG-1000 programs. Commercial shipbuilding volume was up in 2008 as the group ramped up construction of the first three of its product-carrier ships. Slightly lower activity on the DDG-51 destroyer program and the completion of the group’s SSGN submarine conversion contract in the fourth quarter of 2007 slightly offset the other volume increases in the group in 2008. The Marine Systems group improved its performance significantly in 2008, increasing operating earnings at double the rate of revenue growth. As a result of operational efficiencies realized at each of its shipyards, the group increased program earnings rates in 2008 on the Virginia, DDG-51, T-AKE and commercial product carrier programs. These improvements increased the group’s overall margins by 100 basis points in 2008. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Marine Systems group’s backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as numerous repair and engineering contracts. The group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years. For example, in 2008 the group received a $14 billion contract for the construction of eight Virginia-class submarines to be delivered through 2018. After reaching an all-time high of $26.4 billion at the end of 2008, the group’s backlog decreased to $22.5 billion at year-end 2009, consistent with this historical pattern. The group’s funded backlog at the end of 2009 was $7.1 billion, down from $10.5 billion at year-end 2008. The current backlog includes shipbuilding deliveries through 2018. The Virginia-class submarine program was our largest single program in 2009 and is the largest contract in the group’s backlog. The group’s backlog at year end included $16.3 billion for 12 Virginia-class submarines. As the prime contractor on the Virginia-class program, we report the entire backlog and revenues associated with the program but share the construction activity and the earnings equally with our teaming partner. The current Navy plan calls for construction of one submarine in 2010 and two per year beginning in 2011. Navy destroyer programs represent another significant component of the group’s backlog. These include the Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 and Zumwalt-class DDG-1000 destroyer programs. The group’s backlog at the end of 2009 included $1.2 billion for the ongoing design effort and construction of the first DDG-1000. In 2009, the group received approximately $300 in orders under the DDG-1000 program, General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report 27 Table of Contents including approximately $160 for Class Common Equipment (CCE) material to begin construction of the first ship. At year end, the backlog included approximately $365 for the remaining three DDG-51 destroyers under contract. We anticipate receiving funding for long-lead materials for an additional DDG-51 in 2010. The group is currently negotiating contracts with the Navy for the construction of two additional DDG-1000s. We expect these awards to provide stability to the group’s destroyer production for the foreseeable future. The Marine Systems group’s backlog at year end also included $880 for four of the remaining six ships under the Navy’s T-AKE combat-logistics ship program, including $200 of long-lead materials for the last two ships. These two ships have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress, and we expect to receive construction contracts in 2010. The year-end backlog included $390 for the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program. In 2009, the group delivered its first LCS and received an order worth approximately $410 from the Navy for the second ship, scheduled for delivery in 2012. At the end of 2009, the group’s backlog included approximately $125 for the remaining effort on the group’s product carrier contract. In addition, the Marine Systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately $3.2 billion for engineering, repair, overhaul and other services. In January 2010, the Navy awarded the group an additional $120 to continue a development contract for concept studies, engineering and design of a Common Missile Compartment for the next-generation ballistic missile submarines under development for the Navy and the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom. 2010 Outlook We expect 7 to 8 percent revenue growth in Marine Systems in 2010 as activity continues to ramp up on the Virginia-class and DDG-1000 construction programs, as well as submarine engineering activities. The group’s operating margins should moderate somewhat to the mid-9 percent range due to a shift in contract mix from more mature programs to earlier-stage construction, particularly among the group’s destroyer programs. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 Variance Revenues $ 10,802 $ 10,038 $ 764 7.6 % Operating earnings 1,151 1,075 76 7.1 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.7 % The Information Systems and Technology group’s revenues reached the highest level in the group’s history in 2009, with revenue growth generated in each of the group’s market segments. The group’s organic revenue growth was over 4 percent in 2009 with the remainder of the growth provided by acquisitions in the group’s information technology (IT) services and intelligence mission systems businesses. The overall increase in revenues in 2009 was well-distributed across the group’s businesses: Information technology and mission services $ 296 Tactical and strategic mission systems 258 Intelligence mission systems 210 Total increase in revenues $ 764 In the group’s IT services business, approximately 20 percent of the revenue growth in 2009 was organic and resulted primarily from higher volume on several IT infrastructure and support programs, including the New Campus East (NCE) contract for the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, the Network-Centric Solutions (NETCENTS) program for U.S. federal agencies and the Technology Operations and Maintenance Infrastructure Support (TOMIS) contract for the U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration. The revenue growth on these programs was partially offset by lower activity in the commercial wireless market. The most notable performance drivers in the group’s tactical and strategic mission systems business were higher volume on the Warfighter Information Network – Tactical (WIN-T) program and ground-based satellite communications programs, as well as increased sales of encryption products. Volume in the group’s United Kingdom-based tactical communications operations was steady compared with 2008. The intelligence systems business had the highest revenue growth rate in 2009, the result of organic growth in each of its business areas and the acquisition of Axsys Technologies, Inc., in September 2009. Approximately 60 percent of the revenue growth in this business was organic. Higher activity on cyber security and several classified programs, as well as increased volume on a contract to build the spacecraft for NASA’s Landsat Data Continuity Mission, contributed the majority of this growth. The Information Systems and Technology group’s operating earnings increased in line with revenues in 2009. As a result, the group achieved operating margins of 10.7 percent, consistent with 2008. Margins increased in the tactical systems and intelligence systems businesses due to improved performance and a favorable shift in contract mix, but margins were down in the IT services business as a result of contract mix. Review of 2008 vs. 2007 Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Revenues $ 10,038 $ 9,622 $ 416 4.3 % Operating earnings 1,075 1,027 48 4.7 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.7 % Revenues in the Information Systems and Technology group increased in 2008, with the most significant growth over 2007 coming from the group’s tactical and strategic mission systems business. This growth 28 General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report Table of Contents resulted from increased activity on several key U.S. military programs, such as the WIN-T program and the Common Hardware/Software III (CHS-3) program, as well as higher volume on the group’s ground-based satellite communications programs. Revenues were up in the group’s core IT services business due primarily to the ramp-up of activity on several new programs, including the TOMIS contract and the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) Army training contract. Within the IT services business, the group’s commercial wireless operations experienced significantly lower activity in 2008 due to reduced demand in the market. Revenues in the group’s intelligence mission systems business remained steady compared with 2007. Revenues decreased in the group’s U.K. business due to a scheduled decline in activity on the BOWMAN communications program for the U.K. armed forces, offset in part by higher activity on other command, control, communications, computing and intelligence systems (C4I) programs. Operating margins remained steady compared with 2007, as improved performance on the group’s tactical communications programs offset an increased proportion of lower-margin service work in the group’s portfolio. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Information Systems and Technology group generated a book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by revenues) greater than one-to-one in 2009 for the second consecutive year. As a result, the group’s backlog edged up slightly to $10.3 billion at year end after reporting record-level revenues in 2009. The group’s funded backlog grew 16 percent over year-end 2008 to $8.4 billion at the end of 2009. Unlike our other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts that have to be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards, and relatively few large-scale, long-term programs. Some of the more significant programs are highlighted below. The group’s backlog at year-end 2009 included approximately $860 for the Army’s WIN-T program. Information Systems and Technology is the prime contractor on this battlefield communications network program that is designed to provide warfighters with fast, secure, mobile command-and-control capabilities. In 2009, the group received almost $500 of awards for WIN-T, bringing the total program value to $2.1 billion. Approximately $670 of the group’s backlog at year end was for the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP). Under the MHP program, the group is scheduled to provide integrated mission systems, training and support for 28 state-of-the-art helicopters that are intended to replace Canada’s aging fleet of marine helicopters. The group’s backlog at year end also included approximately $400 for maintenance and long-term support activities for the United Kingdom’s BOWMAN communications program. BOWMAN is the secure digital voice and data communications system for the U.K. armed forces. In 2009, the group received almost $500 in orders under this program, including an award to upgrade the system’s capabilities and provide long-term technical support. The Intelligence Information, Command-and-Control Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2) program comprised over $325 of the group’s backlog at the end of 2009. ICE2 supports critical intelligence and command-and-control systems and networks for U.S. defense and intelligence operations worldwide. Approximately $215 of the group’s backlog at year end was for the Warfighter FOCUS program. The group provides support for the Army’s live, virtual and constructive training operations under this contract. In addition to these programs, the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2009, including the following: • Approximately $320 in orders under the CHS-3 program to provide commercial and ruggedized computers, network equipment and software to the U.S. armed forces and other U.S. federal agencies worldwide. The group’s backlog at year end included $175 for CHS-3. • Approximately $310 of orders under the NETCENTS program. This program comprised $250 of the group’s backlog at the end of the year. • Approximately $250 of orders under the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) program for design development and risk reduction. MUOS is designed to enable on-the-move satellite connectivity for U.S. and allied forces. The group’s backlog included $180 for the MUOS program at year end. • Approximately $210 from the Army for initial outfitting and transition support of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and the newly constructed Fort Belvoir Community Hospital. The contract has a maximum potential value of over $320 if all options are exercised. • A contract worth approximately $150 for production and deployed-systems support for the U.S. and United Kingdom SSBN submarine fire control system and the SSGN submarine Attack Weapon Control System (AWCS). • A task order from the Army worth approximately $110 to modernize classroom training technology under the Information Technology Enterprise Technology Solutions-2 Services (ITES-2S) IDIQ contract. • Approximately $70 from the Army to field the enhanced Prophet tactical signals intelligence (SIGINT) system. The contract has a maximum potential value of more than $850 if all options are exercised. General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report 29 Table of Contents The group’s backlog does not include approximately $12.8 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. The value of these arrangements may be realized over the next 12 years. In 2009, funding under IDIQ contracts and options contributed over $3.6 billion, more than one-third of the group’s orders, to the group’s backlog, most notably from WIN-T, CHS-3, NETCENTS and Warfighter FOCUS. Information Systems and Technology was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2009, including the following: • One of 59 General Services Administration (GSA) Alliant contracts to provide federal government agencies with integrated information technology solutions. The Alliant program has a $50 billion maximum potential value among all awardees over a 10-year period. • One of three contracts under the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program (ATEP), which has a maximum potential value of $600 among all awardees, to provide intelligence analysis, software systems development and support, sensor exploitation research, and development of space-based and airborne sensor data for the U.S. Air Force. • One of four contracts under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security National Communications System’s (NCS) National Security and Emergency Preparedness Scientific, Engineering and Technical Assistance program to provide support for national security/emergency preparedness programs. The program has a maximum potential value of $390 among all awardees. • A contract from the Army with a maximum potential value of $200 to develop the Consolidated Product-Line Management system, which will improve the Army’s ability to manage its live combat training system product lines. Shortly after the end of the year, the group received two significant contracts from the Army – one for training support services and one for healthcare IT services. The first is an IDIQ contract to provide technical, management and engineering support services for constructive training systems. It has a maximum potential value of approximately $390. The second is a contract to provide support for the Army’s Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care. The contract is worth more than $150 if all options are exercised. 2010 Outlook We expect revenues in the Information Systems and Technology group to grow by 8 to 9 percent in 2010. We expect each of the group’s businesses to contribute to the growth, particularly in the areas of IT support for intelligence and federal civilian customers, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance work, including cyber security. The group’s operating margins should decline slightly but remain in the mid-10 percent range based on the projected contract mix in 2010. CORPORATE Corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options and a portion of the results from our commercial pension plans. Corporate operating expenses totaled $87 in 2009, $75 in 2008 and $61 in 2007. The increases in Corporate operating expenses in 2009 and 2008 resulted primarily from increased stock option expense. (See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our stock options.) We expect 2010 Corporate operating expenses of approximately $95. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In the mid-1990s, General Dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment, generating strong cash flow to enable a series of acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond our core platform businesses. This has resulted in a larger, more diversified company incorporating new products and technologies that meet the needs of an expanded customer base. We continue to place a strong emphasis on cash generation and capital allocation and deployment. This focus has afforded us the financial flexibility to deploy our cash resources to generate shareholder value while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for the future. Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,855 $ 3,124 $ 2,952 Net cash used by investing activities (1,392 ) (3,663 ) (875 ) Net cash used by financing activities (806 ) (718 ) (786 ) Net cash used by discontinued operations (15 ) (13 ) (4 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents 642 (1,270 ) 1,287 Cash and equivalents at beginning of year 1,621 2,891 1,604 Cash and equivalents at end of year 2,263 1,621 2,891 Marketable securities 360 143 168 Short-and long-term debt (3,864 ) (4,024 ) (2,791 ) Net (debt) surplus (a) $ (1,241 ) $ (2,260 ) $ 268 Debt-to-equity (b) 31.1 % 40.0 % 23.7 % Debt-to-capital (c) 23.7 % 28.6 % 19.2 % (a) Net (debt) surplus is calculated as total debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities. (b) Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity. (c) Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total debt plus total equity. 30 General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report Table of Contents Our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks, commercial paper rated A1/P1 or higher and repurchase agreements with direct obligations of the Spanish government as collateral. Our marketable securities balances are invested primarily in term deposits and high-quality corporate, municipal and U.S. government-sponsored debt securities. The marketable securities have an average duration of six months and an average credit rating of AA-. We have not incurred any material losses associated with these investments. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three years, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Operating Activities We generated cash from operating activities of $2.9 billion in 2009, $3.1 billion in 2008 and $3 billion in 2007. In all three years, the operating cash flow was attributed primarily to net earnings and increasing levels of customer deposits, particularly in the Aerospace group. In 2009, cash from operating activities also reflected the collection of approximately $150 from the Czech Republic after we signed a renegotiated contract to provide Pandur II wheeled vehicles. In 2007, the cash flows from operating activities included the collection of approximately $270 of contract funds upon resolution of the Marine Systems group’s request for equitable adjustment on the T-AKE contract. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to our expectations, the default termination ultimately is sustained and the government prevails on its recovery theories, we, along with The Boeing Company, could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2009. If this were the outcome, we would owe half of the total, or approximately $1.4 billion pretax. Our after-tax cash obligation would be approximately $715. We believe we have sufficient resources, including access to capital markets, to pay such an obligation, if required. Investing Activities We used $1.4 billion in 2009, $3.7 billion in 2008 and $875 in 2007 for investing activities. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures. Business Acquisitions. In 2009, we completed two acquisitions for $811. In 2008, we completed five acquisitions for a total of $3.2 billion. In 2007, we completed four acquisitions for a total of $330. We financed these acquisitions using cash on hand and commercial paper. (See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions.) Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $385 in 2009, $490 in 2008 and $474 in 2007. The decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 resulted from the completion of several major facility improvement projects in the Aerospace and Marine Systems groups. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $450 in 2010, less than 2 percent of revenues. We had no material commitments for capital expenditures on December 31, 2009. Marketable Securities. As a result of lower market interest rates, we have expanded our investments in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities in recent years to generate additional return. Net purchases of these securities were $235 in 2009 compared with net sales of $17 in 2008 and net purchases of $179 in 2007. Financing Activities We used $806 in 2009, $718 in 2008 and $786 in 2007 for financing activities. Our typical financing activities are issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises. Debt Proceeds, Net. We had no material debt issuances or repayments in 2007. In 2008, we issued $904 of commercial paper, primarily to fund acquisitions during the year. During that year we also repaid $500 of fixed-rate notes, $150 of senior notes and $20 of term debt on the scheduled maturity dates. We issued $1 billion of five-year fixed-rate notes in December 2008 and another $750 of two-year fixed-rate notes in June 2009. We used the proceeds from the fixed-rate notes for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures and to term out our commercial paper borrowings. We ended 2009 with no commercial paper outstanding, and our total debt balance was down by $160 from 2008. We have approximately $1.8 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon. These facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program. The next material repayment of long-term debt is $700 of fixed-rate notes scheduled in the third quarter of 2010. (See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including scheduled debt maturities.) Dividends. Our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share on March 4, 2009, the 12th consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share in March 2008 and $0.29 per share in March 2007. Share Repurchases. In 2009, we repurchased 3.6 million of our outstanding shares on the open market. We repurchased 20 million shares in 2008 and 6.5 million shares in 2007 on the open market. On December 31, 2009, approximately 9.4 million shares remained authorized for repurchase by our board of directors – about 2 percent of our total shares outstanding. General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report 31 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Management Metrics Return on Invested Capital. We emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. In 2009, for the 11th consecutive year, net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net earnings. We deployed this cash to complete acquisitions, continue our trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase our outstanding shares. As a result of this continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment, our return on invested capital (ROIC) has grown 290 basis points since 2005. We believe ROIC is a useful measure for investors, because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. ROIC in 2008 and 2009 was impacted by the reduction and increase, respectively, in our shareholders’ equity associated with the returns on our retirement plan assets. (See Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of our retirement plans.) ROIC for 2005 through 2009 is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 Earnings from continuing operations $ 2,407 $ 2,478 $ 2,080 $ 1,710 $ 1,448 After-tax interest expense 117 91 89 106 108 After-tax amortization expense 149 100 99 90 70 Net operating profit after taxes 2,673 2,669 2,268 1,906 1,626 Average debt and equity $ 15,003 $ 14,390 $ 13,430 $ 12,220 $ 10,948 Return on invested capital 17.8 % 18.5 % 16.9 % 15.6 % 14.9 % Free Cash Flow. Our free cash flow from operations was $2.5 billion in 2009, $2.6 billion in 2008, $2.5 billion in 2007 and $1.8 billion in each of 2006 and 2005. We define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,855 $ 3,124 $ 2,952 $ 2,156 $ 2,033 Capital expenditures (385 ) (490 ) (474 ) (334 ) (262 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 2,470 $ 2,634 $ 2,478 $ 1,822 $ 1,771 Cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities 119 % 126 % 142 % 126 % 140 % Free cash flow from operations 103 % 106 % 119 % 107 % 122 % Over the past five years, we have generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of our earnings from continuing operations during the period – an average 110 percent conversion rate. We expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short- and long-term liquidity needs. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Off-balance Sheet Arrangements On December 31, 2009, other than operating leases, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to our stock and classified in shareholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; or variable interests in entities that provide us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support or engage with us in leasing, hedging or research and development services. 32 General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on December 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 4,440 $ 867 $ 1,002 $ 2,138 $ 433 Capital lease obligations 1 1 — — — Operating leases 1,037 220 300 171 346 Purchase obligations (b) 25,195 11,183 7,405 4,033 2,574 Other long-term liabilities (c) 13,088 1,664 2,111 1,623 7,690 $ 43,761 $ 13,935 $ 10,818 $ 7,965 $ 11,043 (a) Includes scheduled interest payments.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to long-term contracts and programs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers’ compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft inventory, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition. We account for revenues and earnings in our defense and aerospace businesses using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize contract revenue as the work progresses – either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered, as applicable. We estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input measures (e.g., costs incurred) or output measures (e.g., contract milestones or units delivered), as appropriate to the circumstances. Where an interim output measure is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion, we use such output measures. Otherwise, we use input measures. We generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion or based on unit deliveries under the contract. Our contracts for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft usually provide for two major phases: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft (i.e., before exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics) and its completion. We record revenue at two contractual milestones: when green aircraft are delivered General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report 33 Table of Contents to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. We do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer and other factors. We include revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the reallocation method rather than the cumulative catch-up method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term, while under the cumulative catch-up method such impact would be recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the loss in the period it is identified. Anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts, including G&A expenses on government contracts. We use the reallocation method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates of total contract revenue, total costs or the extent of progress toward completion on our long-term contracts affect both the period in which the change is identified and future periods. We believe these changes generally reflect expectations as to future performance and, therefore, the reallocation method is the method that best matches our revenues and earnings in the periods in which they are earned. While we have applied this method consistently for more than 30 years, most contractors use the cumulative catch-up method. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications or other disputes. Contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the timing of product deliveries. These estimates are based on our best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts. We review our contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflect changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method. We recognize revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We recognize revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. Estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance. Goodwill. Since 1995, we have acquired 54 businesses at a total cost of approximately $21 billion, including two in 2009. In connection with these acquisitions, we have recognized $12.3 billion of goodwill. Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process that requires a significant level of estimation by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. These estimates require the use of judgment. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations. This requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business, and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows. This discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by “top-down” analyses, including a market assessment of our enterprise value. Beyond the annual impairment test, we review for factors on a quarterly basis that may lead us to perform a goodwill impairment test, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. We have recorded no goodwill impairment to date and do not anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to an impairment in the foreseeable future. The fair value of each of our reporting units on December 31, 2009, substantially exceeded its carrying value. Commitments and Contingencies. We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. We record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally when they are paid. We have elected to defer (or inventory) these costs in contracts in process until they are paid, at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government. We expect to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. This business base includes numerous contracts for which we are the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under 34 General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report Table of Contents our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on our best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. Our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. We determine the long-term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, future pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. For the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our commercial pension and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed under Deferred Contract Costs, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of contributions to our government retirement plans. We have elected to defer recognition of the cumulative net unfunded benefit cost in our government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. Accordingly, the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our future earnings either positively or negatively. We believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. New Accounting Standards In December 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities. ASU 2009-17 provides additional guidance with respect to the requirements for consolidation of a variable interest entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting rights. The standard also requires new disclosures regarding variable interest entities. ASU 2009-17 is effective in the first quarter of 2010. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2009-17 to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820): Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. ASU 2010-06 requires new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASU 2010-06 is effective in the first quarter of 2010. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. See Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of these risks. The following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Foreign Currency Risk We had $1.8 billion in notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding on December 31, 2009, and $2.4 billion on December 31, 2008. A 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following incremental pretax gains and losses: Gain (loss) 2009 2008 Recognized $ 4 $ (12 ) Unrecognized (79 ) (112 ) This exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar, euro/Swiss franc and U.S. dollar/Swiss franc exchange rates. We believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding losses and gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. We believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. Interest Rate Risk Our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations and variable-rate commercial paper. On December 31, 2009, we had $3.9 billion par value of fixed-rate debt. We had no commercial paper outstanding. Our fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable, and we do not trade these securities in the market. A 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations. Investment Risk Our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of one year. On December 31, 2009, we held $2.6 billion in cash and equivalents and marketable securities to be used for general corporate purposes. Our marketable securities have an average duration of six months and an average credit rating of AA-. Given that our investments had an aggregate weighted average maturity of 57 days on December 31, 2009, a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates or market values.

40533,GD,GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP,2011,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For an overview of our business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT The nation’s engagement in combating threats to U.S. national security around the world, coupled with the need to equip and modernize U.S. military forces, drives Department of Defense funding levels. As a defense contractor, our financial performance is influenced by the allocation and prioritization of U.S. defense spending. For fiscal year (FY) 2011, the President requested $549 billion for the Department of Defense, including approximately $189 billion for procurement and research and development (R&D). Procurement and R&D budgets, also known as investment accounts, provide the majority of our U.S. defense revenues. As of February 18, 2011, the Congress has not approved the President’s FY 2011 budget request. Consequently, the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense, is operating under a continuing resolution (CR), which funds the Pentagon at FY 2010 funding levels through early March 2011. For FY 2010, Congress appropriated $531 billion for the Defense Department, including approximately $185 billion for investment accounts. We anticipate that Congress will further consider the FY 2011 defense spending bill in conjunction with the expiration of the current CR. This consideration would likely result in either an extension of the CR, thereby keeping FY 2011 funding at FY 2010 levels, or the passage of a 2011 funding bill. In the case of an extended CR, we are actively engaged with our customers and the Congress to ensure funding required for critical programs is not disrupted. In either case, budget expenditures generally lag congressional funding, and we expect that expenditures applied toward programs over the next few years will be consistent with defense funding appropriated in recent years. To fund the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, defense budgets have also included supplemental funding. While some of our programs have received supplemental funds, most of our funding is now derived from base budgets. For FY 2011, the President has requested approximately $159 billion in supplemental funding, including approximately 16 percent for investment accounts. Future-year spending plans forecast a reduction in supplemental funding levels consistent with the administration’s plan to gradually reduce troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan. For FY 2012, the President has requested total defense funding of $671 billion, including $118 billion in supplemental funding. The 2012 budget requests $188 billion for investment accounts. The Pentagon’s five-year base spending plan, submitted with the FY 2012 funding request, reflects low-single-digit growth in the near-term with growth slowing in later years. This plan incorporates approximately $78 billion of projected cuts when compared with the previous five-year plan. Given force structure levels and current threat levels, the majority of those cuts are not manifested in investment accounts. Rather, investment accounts are projected to display low-single-digit growth over the five-year period, with procurement funding for mature programs growing and R&D funding for developmental programs declining over the period. In today’s dynamic budget environment, the success of our U.S. defense business is enhanced by the diversity of our exposure to different programs and customers within the budget, our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs, our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment, and our successful execution of the contracts we are awarded. While our nation’s budget deficits will influence government spending decisions, we expect defense funding to continue to be driven by the following: • support for the warfighter in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment; • the number of troops deployed globally, coupled with the overall size of the U.S. military; • the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001; • the need to maintain thousands of jobs that support the health of our nation’s economy and • the need to modernize that infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern-day warfare. Given today’s tenuous geopolitical landscape, governments around the world continue to fund weapons and equipment modernization programs, leading to diverse defense export opportunities. We continue to pursue opportunities presented by international demand for military hardware and information technologies, both from our indigenous international operations and through exports from our U.S. businesses. While the revenue potential can be significant, international defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing, changing priorities and overall spending pressures. As we broaden the customer base for our defense products around the world, we expect our international sales and exports to grow. General Dynamics Annual Report Ÿ 2010 19 Table of Contents Business-jet market conditions continued to improve in 2010, in line with the broader economic recovery, particularly in the large-cabin market. Our Aerospace group benefitted from increased flying hours, higher aircraft services activity, improved new-aircraft order interest and declining customer defaults. Barring any further economic turmoil, we believe the diversity and duration of our business-jet backlog positions the Aerospace group for further improvement in 2011 and beyond. Continued investment in new aircraft products is expected to drive Aerospace’s long-term growth, particularly as the group begins producing its newest aircraft offerings, the G250 and the G650, in 2011. Similarly, we believe that aircraft-service revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by continued growth in the global installed business-jet fleet. In these dynamic markets, we are committed to creating shareholder value through innovative product development, disciplined program execution and continuous improvement initiatives. Our solid performance is measured in our sustained revenue and earnings growth, margin improvement and efficient conversion of earnings into cash. Our record of excellent cash-flow conversion has enabled us to execute our operational strategy while providing us the flexibility to deploy our capital to further enhance shareholder returns through acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchases. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our results of operations focuses on the material financial measures we use to evaluate our performance, including revenues, operating earnings and margins, cash flow, and orders and backlog. A consolidated overview is followed by a more detailed review of operating performance for each of our business groups: Aerospace, Combat Systems, Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology. For the Aerospace group, results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services, consistent with how the group is managed. For the defense business groups, the discussion is based on the types of products and services each group offers with supplemental discussion of specific significant contracts and programs that drive the groups’ results. In the Aerospace group, we recognize revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. As discussed further in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section, sales contracts for new aircraft have two major phases: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s completion, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics. We record revenues on these contracts at two milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the aircraft. Revenues in the Aerospace group’s aircraft outfitting and service businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of the service. Changes in revenues in this group result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries (both green and outfitted), the progress toward completion of aircraft outfitting activities, the level of service activity during the period and the number of pre-owned aircraft sold. In general, operating earnings and margins in the Aerospace group are a function of the prices we charge for our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft, and the mix of aircraft deliveries among the higher-margin large-cabin and lower-margin mid-cabin aircraft. Additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margins include the volume and profitability of services work performed, the number and type of pre-owned aircraft sold, and the level of general and administrative costs incurred by the group, which include selling expenses and R&D costs. In the defense business groups, the majority of the revenues are generated by long-term government contracts. We account for revenues under these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this method, revenue is recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered. As a result, changes in revenues are generally discussed in terms of volume. Year-over-year variances attributed to volume indicate increases or decreases in revenues due to changes in production or construction activity levels, delivery schedules or levels of services on individual contracts. Operating earnings and margins in the defense business groups are discussed in terms of changes in revenue volume, performance or contract mix (i.e., higher- vs. lower-margin work). Performance refers to changes in contract earnings rates during the term of the contract based on revisions to estimates of profit at completion on individual contracts. These revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract or the estimated costs required to complete the contract. Contract mix can result in higher or lower earnings and margins due to contract type (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) or the phase of work (e.g., development/production) within those contracts. The following discussion of results provides additional disclosure to the extent that a material or unusual event caused a change in the profitability of a contract (e.g., contract losses/claims). Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 2010 Revenues Operating Earnings Revenues Operating Earnings Revenues Operating Earnings Aerospace $ 5,512 $ 1,021 $ 5,171 $ 707 $ 5,299 $ 860 Combat Systems 8,194 1,111 9,645 1,262 8,878 1,275 Marine Systems 5,556 521 6,363 642 6,677 674 Information Systems and Technology 10,038 1,075 10,802 1,151 11,612 1,219 Corporate – (75) – (87) – (83) $ 29,300 $ 3,653 $ 31,981 $ 3,675 $ 32,466 $ 3,945 20 General Dynamics Annual Report Ÿ 2010 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW REVIEW OF 2010 VS. 2009 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 31,981 $ 32,466 $ 485 1.5 % Operating earnings 3,675 3,945 270 7.3 % Operating margin 11.5 % 12.2 % General Dynamics’ revenues increased in 2010 compared with 2009, with higher revenues in the Aerospace, Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups offset in part by lower Combat Systems revenues. Aerospace revenues improved primarily due to higher aircraft services volume. Growing activity in Marine Systems’ U.S. Navy ship programs resulted in increased revenues for the group in 2010. Increases across the Information Systems and Technology portfolio contributed to revenue growth in the group in 2010, particularly in the tactical communication systems and information technology services businesses. Revenues decreased in the Combat Systems group due primarily to reduced volume on U.S. military vehicle programs. Our operating earnings growth significantly outpaced our sales growth in 2010. Each of our four business groups reported earnings growth compared with 2009. Earnings performance was particularly strong in the Aerospace and Combat Systems groups, both of which realized significant operating leverage in 2010. In the Aerospace group, operating margins were up due to improved pricing on aircraft services work and large-cabin aircraft deliveries, and the absence of pre-owned aircraft losses, which negatively impacted 2009 operating margins. Combat Systems’ 2010 margin expansion resulted from productivity improvements across the group, particularly in the U.S. military vehicle business, and a favorable contract mix, including reduced engineering and development work. Operating margins were steady in the Marine Systems group and down slightly in the Information Systems and Technology group due to a shift in contract mix. As a result, our overall operating margins increased by 70 basis points in 2010 compared with 2009. REVIEW OF 2009 VS. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 Variance Revenues $ 29,300 $ 31,981 $ 2,681 9.2 % Operating earnings 3,653 3,675 22 0.6 % Operating margin 12.5 % 11.5 % In 2009, strong performance in each of our defense businesses more than offset reduced business-jet deliveries in the Aerospace group, resulting in significant top-line revenue growth over 2008. The Combat Systems and Marine Systems groups generated double-digit revenue growth on the strength of military vehicle and shipbuilding and repair programs. In the Information Systems and Technology group, increased volume in each of the group’s U.S. operations drove the group’s revenue growth. Revenues decreased in the Aerospace group in 2009 following our decision to cut aircraft production and deliveries in response to a significant downturn in the business-jet market. Our operating earnings increased slightly in 2009 over 2008 as earnings growth in each of our defense businesses was offset by reduced earnings in the Aerospace group. Overall, our operating margins decreased by 100 basis points in 2009 compared with 2008. Operating margins were up significantly in the Marine Systems group due to strong program execution, while margins were steady in the Information Systems and Technology group and down in the Combat Systems and Aerospace groups. CASH FLOW Cash flows from operations in 2010 exceeded net earnings for the 12th consecutive year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion in 2008, $2.9 billion in 2009 and $3 billion in 2010. Over the three-year period, we deployed our cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase our common stock, pay dividends and repay maturing debt. Our net debt, debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities, was $378 at year-end 2010 compared with General Dynamics Annual Report Ÿ 2010 21 Table of Contents $1.2 billion at the end of 2009. This decrease in net debt was achieved after the following capital deployment activities: $1.2 billion of share repurchases, $631 of dividends paid, $508 of company-sponsored research and development, $370 of capital expenditures, $335 of contributions to our retirement plans and $233 spent on acquisitions during the year. BACKLOG AND ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CONTRACT VALUE Our total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $59.6 billion at the end of 2010 compared with $65.5 billion at year-end 2009. Strong orders across our defense businesses resulted in a book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by revenues) higher than 2009, despite increased revenues in 2010. Orders in our defense businesses were complemented by improving order activity in the Aerospace group, particularly in the second half of the year. The Aerospace group’s total backlog was $17.8 billion at the end of 2010, compared with $19.3 billion at year-end 2009. Aerospace funded backlog was $17.4 billion at the end of 2010 compared with $18.9 billion at the end of 2009. Aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. Net orders, adjusted for customer defaults, increased sequentially each quarter in 2010. However, aircraft deliveries exceeded net orders in 2010, resulting in the backlog decline. The Aerospace unfunded backlog of $378 at the end of 2010 consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The total backlog for our defense businesses decreased in 2010 to $41.8 billion at the end of the year, compared with $46.2 billion at the end of 2009. The defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. Over half of the decline in our defense backlog during 2010 was in Marine Systems, which traditionally receives large, multi-year awards and works down that backlog in subsequent periods. The funded portion of the defense backlog was $25.9 billion at the end of 2010. This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, we have included in the backlog only firm contracts we believe are likely to receive funding. Our backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft, which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value. Customers use IDIQ contracts for several reasons, including expanding the field of available contractors to maximize competition under a given program or when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed. These agreements, which set forth the majority of the contractual terms, including prices, are funded as delivery orders are placed. A significant portion of our estimated potential contract value is composed of multiple-award IDIQ contracts in which we are one of several companies competing for task orders. We include only our estimate of the value we will receive under these arrangements. The estimated contract value also includes IDIQ contracts for which we have been designated as the sole-source supplier to design, develop, produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies. We believe our customers intend to fully implement these products and systems. Because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer’s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders, we recognize these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. Contract options in our defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts, if the customer exercises the option. These options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date. Contract options in the Aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft and long-term agreements with fleet customers. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. On December 31, 2010, the estimated potential contract value associated with these IDIQ contracts and contract options was approximately $21.8 billion, up significantly from $17.6 billion at the end of 2009. This represents our estimate of the potential value we will receive. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower. The estimated potential contract value in the Combat Systems group doubled from year-end 2009, while the Information Systems and Technology group’s estimated potential contract value increased nearly 20 percent. We expect to realize this value over the next 10 to 15 years, reflecting continued demand for our products and services well into the future. OTHER INFORMATION Net interest expense was $66 in 2008, $160 in 2009 and $157 in 2010. Additional debt issued in 2008 and 2009 resulted in the increase from 2008 to 2009. The decrease in 2010 was due largely to the repayment of $700 of fixed-rate notes in the third quarter of 2010. 22 General Dynamics Annual Report Ÿ 2010 Table of Contents We expect net interest expense of approximately $135 to $140 in 2011, subject to capital deployment activities during the year. Our effective tax rate was 31.2 percent in 2008, 31.5 percent in 2009 and 30.7 percent in 2010. The 2008 rate included a $35, or approximately $0.09 per-share, benefit from the settlement of tax refund litigation, which reduced the 2008 tax rate by 100 basis points. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 31 percent in 2011. For additional discussion of tax matters, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2008, we entered into an agreement to sell our Spanish nitrocellulose operation and recognized a pretax loss of $11 in discontinued operations in anticipation of the sale. The sale of this operation was completed in 2010. Our reported revenues exclude the revenues associated with this divested business. We have presented the operating results of this business, along with the loss from the sale, as discontinued operations, net of income taxes. REVIEW OF BUSINESS GROUPS AEROSPACE Review of 2010 vs. 2009 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 5,171 $ 5,299 $ 128 2.5 % Operating earnings 707 860 153 21.6 % Operating margin 13.7 % 16.2 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 94 99 5 5.3 % Completion 110 89 (21 ) (19.1 )% The Aerospace group’s revenues increased in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to steady growth in aircraft services activity throughout the year. Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues remained consistent with 2009 levels, with an increase in manufacturing volume offset by reduced outfitting work. Aircraft manufacturing revenues increased 9 percent in 2010, the result of additional deliveries and a more favorable mix of green Gulfstream aircraft. The decline in aircraft outfitting revenues was associated primarily with the group’s completions work for other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), reflecting decreased OEM production across the broader business-jet market. Aircraft services revenues, which include both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation’s maintenance and repair work, fixed-base operations and aircraft management services, increased 15 percent in 2010, reflecting the growing installed base of business-jet aircraft and increased utilization as the business-jet market recovers following the economic downturn. Revenues from sales of pre-owned aircraft were down slightly from 2009. The group’s operating earnings improved significantly in 2010 compared with 2009, with improvements in all areas of the group’s portfolio. The components of the earnings growth were as follows: Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting $ 68 Pre-owned aircraft 40 Aircraft services 29 SG&A/other 16 Total increase in operating earnings $ 153 The group’s aircraft manufacturing and outfitting earnings were up in 2010 compared with 2009 due to the increase in aircraft manufacturing volume, as well as improved pricing on large-cabin aircraft and mix shift within large-cabin models. This increase was offset in part by reduced liquidated damages associated with fewer customer defaults. Margins for these activities were up 190 basis points compared with 2009. Pre-owned aircraft earnings improved significantly from 2009, when the group wrote down the carrying value of its pre-owned aircraft inventory. Pricing in the pre-owned market has improved since mid-2009, particularly for large-cabin aircraft, although inventories across the industry remain higher than historic norms. In 2010, the Aerospace group realized modest profits on its pre-owned sales, took no pre-owned aircraft write-downs and ended the year with no pre-owned aircraft in inventory. Consistent with the increased volume, aircraft services earnings continued to improve from 2009. Margins associated with aircraft services were up 70 basis points in 2010 due to improved marketplace pricing. The group’s operating earnings in 2010 were also favorably impacted by the timing of R&D expenditures and the absence of severance costs associated with workforce reductions in 2009. As a result of the factors discussed above, the group’s overall operating margins increased 250 basis points in 2010 compared with 2009. Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 Variance Revenues $ 5,512 $ 5,171 $ (341 ) (6.2 )% Operating earnings 1,021 707 (314 ) (30.8 )% Operating margin 18.5 % 13.7 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 156 94 (62 ) (39.7 )% Completion 152 110 (42 ) (27.6 )% The Aerospace group’s revenues decreased in 2009, the result of a decline in sales of Gulfstream aircraft that was offset in part by the addition of Jet Aviation, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2008. We reduced Gulfstream’s 2009 aircraft production, primarily in the group’s mid-cabin General Dynamics Annual Report Ÿ 2010 23 Table of Contents models, in response to the market downturn in late 2008. As a result, aircraft-manufacturing revenues decreased significantly in 2009 compared with 2008. Gulfstream aircraft-services revenues were down in 2009 due to reduced flying hours and customer deferral of aircraft maintenance. The group’s operating earnings declined in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to the factors noted above. The earnings decline associated with decreased Gulfstream aircraft deliveries was mitigated by cost-reduction initiatives, liquidated damages collected on defaulted aircraft contracts, and the fact that the majority of the reduction in deliveries was in our lower-margin mid-cabin aircraft. As a result, aircraft manufacturing margins increased in 2009 over 2008 despite the decline in volume during the year. Aircraft services earnings were steady, as the addition of Jet Aviation offset a decrease at Gulfstream. However, competitive marketplace pressures reduced margins. Operating earnings in 2009 were also negatively impacted by losses on pre-owned aircraft inventories and severance costs associated with workforce reductions. Overall, the group’s operating margins decreased 480 basis points in 2009 compared with 2008. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Aerospace group finished 2010 with a total backlog of $17.8 billion, of which $17.4 billion was funded. The group booked the highest number of orders for new aircraft in 2010 since the introduction of the G650 in 2008. Customer demand improved throughout the year, with net orders, adjusted for customer defaults, improving sequentially in each quarter of 2010. However, aircraft deliveries exceeded net orders in 2010, resulting in the backlog decline. We expect net order activity to remain strong in 2011. The group’s large-cabin backlog remains well positioned, with an 18- to 24-month period between customer order and aircraft delivery. While improving, conditions in the mid-cabin market remain difficult, though these aircraft represent a small share of the group’s portfolio. Order activity has been further strengthened by the group’s newest aircraft models, the G650 and the G250. Both of these aircraft continue to perform well in flight testing and remain on track for 2011 aircraft certification. The G250 and the G650 are scheduled to enter service in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Over the past few years, the group’s customer base has become increasingly diverse, both in customer type and geographic region. Approximately two-thirds of the group’s year-end backlog is composed of private companies and individual buyers, though we are seeing renewed interest from large public companies. While the installed base of aircraft is predominately in North America, international customers comprise nearly 60 percent of the group’s backlog, with growing order interest in emerging markets, particularly from the Asia-Pacific region. Total backlog does not include options to purchase new aircraft or long-term agreements with fleet customers. These arrangements totaled $1.4 billion at the end of 2010 and are included in estimated potential contract value. 2011 Outlook We expect an increase of approximately 15 to 16 percent in the group’s revenues in 2011 compared with 2010, the result of increased large-cabin aircraft deliveries, including initial green deliveries of the G650, and continued growth in aircraft services activity. We expect the Aerospace group’s margins to be in the mid- to high-15 percent range, down modestly from 2010, due to reduced liquidated damages associated with fewer customer defaults and increasing service activity. COMBAT SYSTEMS Review of 2010 vs. 2009 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 9,645 $ 8,878 $ (767 ) (8.0 )% Operating earnings 1,262 1,275 13 1.0 % Operating margin 13.1 % 14.4 % The Combat Systems group’s revenues were down in 2010 compared with 2009 due to reduced volume in the group’s U.S. and European military vehicle businesses. The decrease in the group’s revenues consisted of the following: U.S. military vehicles $ (600) Weapons systems and munitions 6 European military vehicles (173) Total decrease in revenues $ (767) In the group’s U.S. military vehicle business, lower Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicle production and reduced engineering work represented the majority of the decline in revenues from 2009. The group’s deliveries of MRAP vehicles have fluctuated over the past two years in response to the customer’s urgent deployment needs. The reduction in activity on engineering programs related primarily to the 2009 cancellation of the manned ground vehicle portion of the Future Combat Systems (FCS) 24 General Dynamics Annual Report Ÿ 2010 Table of Contents program and decreased volume on the Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV). These declines were offset in part by increased volume on the group’s foreign military sales (FMS) contracts to provide light armored vehicles (LAVs) and tanks to international customers. Revenues were steady in the group’s weapons systems and munitions businesses. Increased sales of axles, largely in the military market, and higher demand for the group’s propellant products and munitions in Canada, were offset in part by lower armor kit production and the completion of deliveries of detection systems that protect U.S. combat forces from improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Revenues in the group’s European military vehicle business decreased in 2010 as a result of the ramp-down of the Leopard tank program for the Spanish government and lower activity on the group’s Pandur and Piranha vehicle contracts for various international customers. Increased activity on other vehicle contracts, including the EAGLE vehicle for Germany, helped offset these decreases. Despite the decline in revenues, the Combat Systems group’s operating earnings increased slightly in 2010. Productivity improvements across the group, particularly in the U.S. military vehicle business, and a favorable contract mix that included reduced engineering and development work resulted in significant margin improvement in 2010. The group’s operating margins increased 130 basis points in 2010 compared with 2009. Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 Variance Revenues $ 8,194 $ 9,645 $ 1,451 17.7 % Operating earnings 1,111 1,262 151 13.6 % Operating margin 13.6 % 13.1 % In 2009, the Combat Systems group’s revenues increased significantly compared with 2008 due to strong contributions from each of the group’s businesses. In the group’s U.S. military vehicle business, increased Stryker wheeled combat vehicle and Abrams main battle tank volume was the primary contributor of the revenue growth. Revenues were up in the group’s weapons systems and munitions businesses due to the acquisition of AxleTech International in December 2008, increased production of armor kits and an increase in deliveries of Hydra-70 rockets. The group’s European military vehicle business generated strong revenue growth in 2009 as a result of higher activity on several wheeled vehicle production programs. The Combat Systems group’s operating earnings grew in 2009, though at a lower rate than revenues, resulting in a 50 basis-point decrease in operating margins compared with 2008. The operating margins in 2008 were influenced by a favorable program mix in the U.S. military vehicle business. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Combat Systems group’s total backlog was $11.8 billion at the end of 2010, down from $13.4 billion at year-end 2009. Funded backlog decreased 5 percent in 2010 to $10.9 billion at year end. The group’s backlog consists primarily of long-term production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through 2016. The Army’s Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program comprised $1.8 billion of the group’s backlog at year end, including the production of vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2012. The group received over $1.7 billion of Stryker orders in 2010, including awards for contractor logistics support, vehicle production and engineering services. Stryker orders in 2010 also included awards for Stryker double-V-hulled vehicles, designed and developed in quick response to the customer’s urgent deployment requirements. The group’s backlog at the end of 2010 included $1.7 billion for M1 Abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs. These programs include the M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP) under which we retrofit Abrams tanks with improved electronics, command-and-control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tanks’ effectiveness. The group continued work in 2010 on a multi-year contract awarded in 2008 to upgrade the remaining M1A1 Abrams tanks to the SEP configuration. Approximately half of the group’s Abrams backlog at year end was for the SEP program. In 2010, the group received awards from the Army totaling $380 for all Abrams-related programs. The group’s backlog at year end also included approximately $400 under the MRAP program, largely for upgrade kits for previously delivered RG-31 vehicles, and $305 for the EFV program. The Combat Systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog. The backlog at the end of the year included: • $1.9 billion for LAVs under several FMS contracts, • $520 for the production of Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles scheduled for delivery to the Spanish army through 2016, • $460 for Pandur vehicles for several international customers, General Dynamics Annual Report Ÿ 2010 25 Table of Contents • $215 from the Swiss government to provide Duro wheeled armored personnel vehicles, • $200 for the design, integration and production of seven prototypes under the U.K.’s Specialist Vehicle program, in addition to the integration work being performed by the Information Systems and Technology group and • $180 for a contract with the German government to provide EAGLE IV wheeled military vehicles. The Combat Systems group’s backlog at year end also included approximately $2.6 billion in weapons systems and munitions programs. In 2010, the group received awards totaling approximately $275 for the production of Hydra-70 rockets. The group also received awards worth approximately $180 from the Canadian government to supply various calibers of ammunition, $150 from the Army for armor for Stryker and Bradley vehicles and $75 from the Army for production of M2A1 machine guns. Combat Systems backlog does not include approximately $4.6 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with the group’s anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. The group’s estimated potential contract value doubled since year-end 2009 due to contracts awarded in 2010, including the Specialist Vehicle and Hydra-70 rocket programs. 2011 Outlook We expect Combat Systems revenues to remain in the $9 billion range in 2011 with growth in international vehicle contracts, steady volume on U.S. weapons and munitions programs, and a reduction in volume on some of the group’s U.S. vehicle programs. We expect the group’s operating margins to be approximately 14 percent, down modestly from 2010 due to a shift in program mix. MARINE SYSTEMS Review of 2010 vs. 2009 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 6,363 $ 6,677 $ 314 4.9% Operating earnings 642 674 32 5.0% Operating margin 10.1 % 10.1 % The Marine Systems group’s revenues increased in 2010 compared with 2009 as growth in several U.S. Navy programs offset a decline in commercial ship construction. The increase in revenues consisted of the following: Multi-year Navy ship construction $ 170 Other Navy ship design, construction, engineering and repair 279 Commercial ship construction (135) Total increase in revenues $ 314 The group’s multi-year ship-construction programs for the U.S. Navy include Virginia-class submarines, DDG-51 and DDG-1000 destroyers, and T-AKE combat-logistics ships. The principal driver of revenue growth in 2010 was increased activity on the Virginia-class program as the group continued to ramp toward construction of two submarines per year in 2011. The group delivered the seventh boat under the program in 2010 while construction continued on the next five boats. Deliveries of the remaining 11 boats under contract are scheduled through 2018. In our surface combatant business, volume decreased on the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke program as the current multi-ship contract nears completion. Offsetting this decline was an increase in activity on the group’s design and construction contract for the first DDG-1000 Zumwalt-class destroyer. The remaining two DDG-51 destroyers under contract are scheduled for delivery in 2011 and 2012, and the first DDG-1000 delivery is scheduled in 2014. Activity on the group’s T-AKE program was down in 2010 as construction continued on the remaining four ships. The group delivered the ninth and 10th ships in 2010, and deliveries of the last four ships are scheduled through 2012. In 2010, the group also began advanced design efforts for the Mobile Landing Platform (MLP) program. In addition to these ship-construction programs, revenues were up significantly in 2010 on the group’s engineering programs, particularly work associated with the next-generation ballistic-missile submarine (SSBN). The group is performing initial concept studies, including design of a Common Missile Compartment for both the U.S. Navy and the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom. The group’s ship repair work has remained steady in 2010 following significant growth in 2009. In 2010, the group completed construction on the final two ships of a five-ship commercial product-carrier contract. Given the success of this program, the age of the fleet of Jones Act ships and environmental regulations that require double-hull tankers and impose emission control limits, we anticipate additional commercial shipbuilding opportunities as the economy recovers. The Marine Systems group’s operating earnings increased in 2010 consistent with the increase in revenues. Operating margins remained steady compared with 2009, though the group is undergoing a shift in contract mix. Activity on the group’s destroyer programs is moving from the fixed-price DDG-51 program to the cost-reimbursable DDG-1000 contract, and the Virginia-class program is transitioning from the mature Block II contract to the Block III contract. Favorable performance on the T-AKE and commercial product carrier programs in 2010 helped offset this mix shift. 26 General Dynamics Annual Report Ÿ 2010 Table of Contents Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 Variance Revenues $ 5,556 $ 6,363 $ 807 14.5 % Operating earnings 521 642 121 23.2 % Operating margin 9.4 % 10.1 % Revenues were up significantly in 2009 across the Marine Systems group. Increased activity on the Virginia-class program in preparation of starting construction of two submarines per year contributed almost two-thirds of the group’s increase in 2009 revenues. Volume also increased on the DDG-1000 and the group’s engineering and repair programs for the Navy. Lower activity on the DDG-51 and T-AKE programs slightly offset the other volume increases in the group in 2009. The Marine Systems group’s operating earnings increased significantly in 2009. As a result of operational efficiencies realized at each of its businesses, the group increased program earnings rates in 2009 on the Virginia-class, DDG-51, DDG-1000 and commercial product carrier programs. These improvements increased the group’s overall margins by 70 basis points in 2009, a significant improvement following a 100-basis point margin increase in 2008. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Marine Systems group’s backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as numerous repair and engineering contracts. The group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years. For example, in 2008, the group received a $14 billion contract for the construction of eight Virginia-class submarines to be delivered through 2018, increasing backlog to an all-time high of $26.4 billion at the end of 2008. Consistent with this historical pattern, as the group has performed on these multi-year contracts, the backlog has decreased to $20.1 billion at year-end 2010. The group’s funded backlog was $7.1 billion at the end of both 2009 and 2010. The Virginia-class submarine program was the group’s largest program in 2010 and is the largest contract in the group’s backlog. The group’s backlog at year end included $13.7 billion for 11 Virginia-class submarines. As the prime contractor on the Virginia-class program, we report the entire backlog and revenues associated with the program but share the construction activity and the earnings with our teaming partner. Navy destroyer programs represent another significant component of the group’s backlog. These include the Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 and Zumwalt-class DDG-1000 destroyer programs. The group’s backlog at the end of 2010 included $855 for the ongoing design effort and construction of the first DDG-1000. In 2010, the group received approximately $420 in orders under the DDG-1000 program, including continued engineering and support services, long-lead construction for the second ship and long-lead material for the third ship. The group expects to be awarded construction contracts for the second and third DDG-1000 ships in 2011. At year end, the backlog also included approximately $220 for the remaining two DDG-51 destroyers under contract. The Navy plans to continue the DDG-51 program, and the group expects to receive an award for an additional DDG-51 in 2011 following funding for long-lead material for this ship in 2010. The Marine Systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately $965 for the four remaining ships under the Navy’s T-AKE combat-logistics ship program. In 2010, we received construction contracts for the last two ships of the program. The year-end backlog also included approximately $340 for the group’s second ship under the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program, scheduled for delivery in 2012, and $95 for the MLP program. The Navy plans to build three MLP auxiliary support ships, and the contract for construction of the first ship is scheduled to be awarded in 2011. In addition, the Marine Systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately $3.9 billion for engineering, repair, overhaul and other services, including engineering and design efforts for the next-generation SSBN. 2011 Outlook We expect the Marine Systems group’s revenues in 2011 to remain near 2010 levels as increased Virginia-class production and submarine engineering activity is offset by lower DDG-51, T-AKE and commercial volume. We expect the group’s operating margins to decline to the low-9 percent range due to the continued mix shift in ship-construction programs. General Dynamics Annual Report Ÿ 2010 27 Table of Contents INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Review of 2010 vs. 2009 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 10,802 $ 11,612 $ 810 7.5 % Operating earnings 1,151 1,219 68 5.9 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.5 % The Information Systems and Technology group generated strong top-line growth in 2010, with over 5 percent organic growth. The increase in revenues over 2009 was driven by the group’s tactical communication systems and information technology services businesses: Tactical communication systems $ 421 Information technology (IT) services 342 Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems 47 Total increase in revenues $ 810 Revenues in the tactical communication systems business increased significantly in 2010 due to higher volume in battlefield communication programs, in particular the Warfighter Information Network–Tactical (WIN-T) mobile communication network, and ruggedized computing products. Revenues in the group’s United Kingdom-based operations also increased in 2010 as work began on the demonstration phase of the U.K. Ministry of Defence Specialist Vehicle program. In the IT services business, volume increased on the group’s IT support and modernization programs for the intelligence community and the Network-Centric Solutions (NETCENTS) program, which provides network support for federal agencies. Revenues also increased in this business as a result of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) facility changes, including work on the New Campus East (NCE) contract for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center relocation and Fort Belvoir Community Hospital outfitting for the Army. Revenues were up in 2010 compared with 2009 in the group’s ISR business as a result of the acquisition of Axsys Technologies, Inc., in the third quarter of 2009. The group also experienced growth in cyber-related programs across its businesses in 2010, including systems that prevent network attacks, increase situational awareness and reduce network vulnerability. The Information Systems and Technology group’s operating earnings increased in 2010, although at a slightly lower rate than revenues, resulting in a modest decrease in margins compared with 2009. The reduction in margins resulted from a shift in the group’s contract mix to include a growing proportion of IT services work. Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 Variance Revenues $ 10,038 $ 10,802 $ 764 7.6 % Operating earnings 1,075 1,151 76 7.1 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.7 % The Information Systems and Technology group generated revenue growth in each of the group’s market segments in 2009. Organic growth of more than 4 percent was augmented by acquisitions in the group’s IT services and ISR businesses. Revenues increased on the WIN-T program and ground-based satellite communications programs in the group’s tactical communication business. In the IT services business, higher volume on several IT infrastructure and support contracts, including NCE and NETCENTS, accounted for the increase in revenues. Growing levels of cyber security-related work and higher activity on several classified programs contributed to the growth in the group’s ISR business. Operating earnings increased in line with revenues in 2009, resulting in operating margins of 10.7 percent, consistent with 2008. Higher margins in the tactical communications and ISR businesses due to improved performance and a favorable shift in contract mix were offset by decreased margins in the IT services business. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Information Systems and Technology group received the highest level of orders in the group’s history in 2010, generating a book-to-bill ratio of nearly one-to-one. As a result, the group ended the year with a backlog of $9.8 billion after reporting record-level revenues in 2010. The group’s backlog does not include approximately $15.2 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. In 2010, funding under IDIQ contracts and options contributed over $4.3 billion to the group’s backlog, or nearly 40 percent of the group’s orders. The estimated potential contract value in the Information Systems and Technology group increased nearly 20 28 General Dynamics Annual Report Ÿ 2010 Table of Contents percent from year-end 2009, due most notably to unexercised options associated with the U.K. Specialist Vehicle and combat and seaframe control systems for the Independence Class of ships under the LCS program. When combined with backlog, the group’s total estimated potential contract value increased by 8 percent over 2009 to $25 billion. Unlike our other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts that largely have to be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards. While the group has relatively few large-scale, long-term programs, there are several significant contracts that provide a solid foundation for the business. Programs for the U.K. Ministry of Defence comprised approximately $835 of the group’s backlog at the end of 2010, most notably the BOWMAN and the Specialist Vehicle programs. The group has successfully fielded the BOWMAN communications system, the secure digital voice and data communications system for the U.K. armed forces, and is now performing maintenance and long-term support and enhancement activities for the program. In 2010, the Ministry of Defence awarded the group a contract for the demonstration phase of its Specialist Vehicle program. In this phase, the group will manage the design, integration and production of seven prototype vehicles. Work and the backlog under the contract are shared with the Combat Systems group, including a significant portion of the future vehicle production effort. The group’s backlog at year-end 2010 included approximately $645 for the Army’s WIN-T program. Information Systems and Technology is the prime contractor on this battlefield communications network designed to provide warfighters with fast, secure, mobile command-and-control capabilities. In 2010, the group received approximately $405 of awards for WIN-T, bringing the total program value to $2.7 billion. The backlog does not include $920 of estimated potential contract value for the WIN-T program awarded under an IDIQ format. Approximately $340 of the group’s backlog at year end was for the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP). Under the MHP program, the group is providing integrated mission systems, training and support for 28 state-of-the-art helicopters that are intended to replace Canada’s aging fleet of marine helicopters. The Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog at year end also included approximately $225 for the Common Hardware/Software III (CHS-3) program to provide commercial and ruggedized computers, network equipment and software to the U.S. armed forces and other U.S. federal agencies. In 2010, the group received over $500 in orders under this program, bringing the total contract value to more than $2.4 billion. The group’s backlog at the end of 2010 included approximately $960 for a number of facility infrastructure and support programs, including NCE, NETCENTS, and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and Mark Center facilities. In addition to these programs, the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2010, including the following: • $240 from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for the Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment (SGSS) project to modernize the ground segment of the satellite communications network used by NASA. • $190 for the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) program to provide support for the Army’s live, virtual and constructive training operations. • $150 from Austal USA for design, integration and testing of combat and seaframe control systems for one LCS. The contract includes options for nine additional ships that are scheduled to be exercised over the next five years and are included in the group’s estimated potential contract value. • $110 for the Army’s Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Handheld, Manpack, Small Form Fit (HMS) radio program, bringing the total contract value to over $700. • $80 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to design, manufacture and install antennas for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites-R (GOES-R). • $55 from the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) to analyze and reduce cyber threats and vulnerabilities. Information Systems and Technology was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2010, including the following: • One of 46 awards from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) under the Information Technology Supplies and Support Services (ITSSS) program to provide technical services and engage in developmental projects and programs. The program has a maximum potential value of $30 billion among all awardees over eight years. • One of 11 awards under the Defense Intelligence Agency’s (DIA) Solutions for the Information Technology Enterprise (SITE) program. The program has a maximum potential value of $6.6 billion among all awardees over five years. • One of five awards under the Missile Defense Agency Engineering and Support Services (MiDAESS) program to provide systems engineering and testing services. The program has a maximum potential value of $1.6 billion among all awardees over five years. • One of three awards under the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) System Engineering 2020 Research and Development/Mission Analysis Support program. Our award under this program has a maximum potential value of $1.2 billion over 10 years. General Dynamics Annual Report Ÿ 2010 29 Table of Contents • One of 14 awards from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to develop satellite-based intelligence-gathering technology for the Total Application Services for Enterprise Requirements (TASER) program. The program has a maximum potential value of $1 billion among all awardees over five years. • One of three awards under the Navy’s Common Afloat Local Area Network Infrastructure (CALI) program to provide ships and submarines with secure hardware, software and networking equipment. The program has a maximum potential value of $500 among all awardees. • One of five contracts to support several of the Army’s healthcare construction projects, including modernization of current Army medical facilities and transition to newly constructed facilities. The program has a maximum potential value of over $400 among all awardees over four years. 2011 Outlook We expect revenues in the Information Systems and Technology group to grow approximately 3 to 5 percent in 2011. We expect each of the group’s businesses to contribute to the growth, particularly in the areas of IT support services for intelligence and federal civilian customers, and tactical communication systems. The group’s operating margins are expected to decline slightly but remain above 10 percent based on the projected contract mix in 2011. CORPORATE Corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options. Corporate operating expenses totaled $75 in 2008, $87 in 2009 and $83 in 2010. (See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our stock options.) We expect 2011 Corporate operating expenses of approximately $90 to $95. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In the mid-1990s, General Dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment, generating strong cash flow to enable a series of acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond our core platform businesses. This has resulted in a larger, more diversified company incorporating new products and technologies that meet the needs of an expanded customer base. We continue to place a strong emphasis on cash generation and capital allocation and deployment. This focus has afforded us the financial flexibility to deploy our cash resources to generate shareholder value while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities. Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,124 $ 2,855 $ 2,986 Net cash used by investing activities (3,663 ) (1,392 ) (408 ) Net cash used by financing activities (718 ) (806 ) (2,226 ) Net cash used by discontinued operations (13 ) (15 ) (2 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents (1,270 ) 642 350 Cash and equivalents at beginning of year 2,891 1,621 2,263 Cash and equivalents at end of year 1,621 2,263 2,613 Marketable securities 143 360 212 Short- and long-term debt (4,024 ) (3,864 ) (3,203 ) Net debt (a) $ (2,260 ) $ (1,241 ) $ (378 ) Debt-to-equity (b) 40.0 % 31.1 % 24.1 % Debt-to-capital (c) 28.6 % 23.7 % 19.4 % (a) Net debt is calculated as total debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities. (b) Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity. (c) Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity. Our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks, commercial paper rated A1/P1 or higher and repurchase agreements with direct obligations of the Spanish government as collateral. Our marketable securities balances are invested primarily in term deposits and high-quality corporate, municipal and U.S. government-sponsored debt securities. The marketable securities have an average duration of two months and an average credit rating of AA. We have not incurred any material losses associated with these investments. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three years, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 30 General Dynamics Annual Report Ÿ 2010 Table of Contents OPERATING ACTIVITIES We generated cash from operating activities of $3.1 billion in 2008, $2.9 billion in 2009 and $3 billion in 2010. In all three years, the operating cash flow was attributed primarily to net earnings. In 2008 and 2009, increasing levels of customer deposits, particularly in the Aerospace group, reduced our operating working capital (OWC) and increased our operating cash flow. In addition, 2009 cash from operating activities reflected the collection of approximately $150 from the Czech Republic after we signed a renegotiated contract to provide Pandur II wheeled vehicles. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to our expectations, the default termination ultimately is sustained and the government prevails on its recovery theories, we, along with The Boeing Company, could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010. If this were the outcome, we would owe half of the total, or approximately $1.4 billion pretax. Our after-tax cash obligation would be approximately $725. We believe we have sufficient resources, including access to capital markets, to pay such an obligation, if required. INVESTING ACTIVITIES We used $3.7 billion in 2008, $1.4 billion in 2009 and $408 in 2010 for investing activities. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities. Investing activities also include proceeds received from the sale of assets and marketable securities. Business Acquisitions. In 2008, we completed five acquisitions for a total of $3.2 billion. In 2009, we completed two acquisitions for $811. In 2010, we completed three acquisitions for $233. We financed these acquisitions using cash on hand and commercial paper. (See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions.) Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $490 in 2008, $385 in 2009 and $370 in 2010. The decrease in 2009 and 2010 compared with 2008 resulted from the completion of several major facility improvement projects in the Aerospace and Marine Systems groups. During 2010, the Aerospace group announced a new $500, seven-year facilities expansion project at the group’s Savannah campus. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $550 in 2011, less than 2 percent of revenues. Marketable Securities. As a result of lower market interest rates, we have expanded our investments in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities in recent years to generate additional return. Net sales/maturities of these securities were $17 in 2008 compared with net purchases of $235 in 2009 and net sales/maturities of $115 in 2010. FINANCING ACTIVITIES We used $718 in 2008, $806 in 2009 and $2.2 billion in 2010 for financing activities. Our financing activities include issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises. Debt Proceeds, Net. In 2008, we issued $904 of commercial paper, primarily to fund acquisitions during the year. During that year we also repaid $500 of fixed-rate notes, $150 of senior notes and $20 of term debt on their scheduled maturity dates. We issued $1 billion of five-year fixed-rate notes in December 2008 and another $750 of two-year fixed-rate notes in June 2009. We used the proceeds from the fixed-rate notes for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures and to term out our commercial paper borrowings. In August 2010, we repaid $700 of fixed-rate notes on their scheduled maturity date. We ended 2010 with no commercial paper outstanding, and our total debt balance was down approximately $660 from 2009, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 24.1 percent, down 7 percentage points from year-end 2009. We have approximately $2 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon. These facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program. We also have an effective shelf registration on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The next material repayment of long-term debt is $750 of fixed-rate notes scheduled to mature in July of 2011. As we approach the maturity date, we will determine whether to repay these notes with cash on hand or refinance the obligation. (See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including scheduled debt maturities.) Dividends. Our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share on March 3, 2010, the 13th consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $0.38 per share in March 2009 and $0.35 per share in March 2008. Share Repurchases. Our board of directors has historically supported management’s tactical repurchase of our shares, typically in repurchase authorizations of 10 million-share increments. We repurchased 20 million shares on the open market in 2008, 3.6 million shares in 2009 and 18.9 million shares in 2010. As a result, we reduced our shares outstanding by 3.5 percent in the past year and by 8 percent since 2008. On February 2, 2011, the board authorized management to repurchase up to an additional 10 million shares, about 3 percent of our total shares outstanding. We expect to continue to repurchase shares as part of our capital deployment activities in the future. General Dynamics Annual Report Ÿ 2010 31 Table of Contents NON-GAAP MANAGEMENT METRICS We emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. In 2010, for the 12th consecutive year, net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net earnings. We deployed this cash to complete acquisitions, continue our trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase our outstanding shares. As described below, we use free cash flow and return on invested capital (ROIC) to measure our ability to efficiently convert net earnings into cash and to earn a return on the deployment of that capital. Free Cash Flow. We define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,156 $ 2,952 $ 3,124 $ 2,855 $ 2,986 Capital expenditures (334 ) (474 ) (490 ) (385 ) (370 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 1,822 $ 2,478 $ 2,634 $ 2,470 $ 2,616 Cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities 126 % 142 % 126 % 119 % 114 % Free cash flow from operations 107 % 119 % 106 % 103 % 100 % Over the past five years, we have generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of our earnings from continuing operations during the period, an average 106 percent conversion rate. We expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short- and long-term liquidity needs. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy. Return on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a useful measure for investors, because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. As a result of our continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment, ROIC has grown 190 basis points since 2006. ROIC for 2006 through 2010 is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Earnings from continuing operations $ 1,710 $ 2,080 $ 2,478 $ 2,407 $ 2,628 After-tax interest expense 106 89 91 117 116 After-tax amortization expense 90 99 100 149 155 Net operating profit after taxes 1,906 2,268 2,669 2,673 2,899 Average debt and equity $ 12,220 $ 13,430 $ 14,390 $ 15,003 $ 16,587 Return on invested capital 15.6 % 16.9 % 18.5 % 17.8 % 17.5 % 32 General Dynamics Annual Report Ÿ 2010 Table of Contents ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS On December 31, 2010, other than operating leases, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to our stock and classified in shareholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; or variable interests in entities that provide us with financing, liquidity, market-risk or credit-risk support or engage with us in leasing, hedging or research and development services.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to long-term contracts and programs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers’ compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft inventory, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition. We account for revenues and earnings in our defense and aerospace businesses using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize contract revenue as the work progresses, either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered, as applicable. We estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit General Dynamics Annual Report Ÿ 2010 33 Table of Contents over the remaining life of the contract based on either input measures (e.g., costs incurred) or output measures (e.g., contract milestones or units delivered), as appropriate to the circumstances. Where an interim output measure is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion, we use such output measures. Otherwise, we use input measures. We generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion or based on unit deliveries under the contract. Our contracts for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft usually provide for two major phases: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft (i.e., before exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics) and its completion. We record revenue at two contractual milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. We do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer and other factors. We include revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the reallocation method rather than the cumulative catch-up method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term, while under the cumulative catch-up method such impact would be recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the loss in the period it is identified. Anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts, including general and administrative expenses on government contracts. We use the reallocation method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates of total contract revenue, total costs or the extent of progress toward completion on our long-term contracts affect both the period in which the change is identified and future periods. We believe these changes generally reflect expectations as to future performance and, therefore, the reallocation method is the method that best matches our revenues and earnings in the periods in which they are earned. While we have applied this method consistently for more than 30 years, most contractors use the cumulative catch-up method. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications or other disputes. Contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the timing of product deliveries. These estimates are based on our best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts. We review our contract estimates regularly to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflect changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method. We recognize revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We recognize revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. Estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance. Goodwill. Since 1995, we have acquired 57 businesses at a total cost of approximately $21 billion, including three in 2010. In connection with these acquisitions, we have recognized $12.6 billion of goodwill. Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process that requires a significant level of estimation by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. These estimates require the use of judgment. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations. This requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows. This discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by “top-down” analyses, including a market assessment of our enterprise value. Beyond the annual impairment test, we review for factors on a quarterly basis that may lead us to perform a goodwill impairment test, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. We have recorded no goodwill impairment to date and do not anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to an impairment in the foreseeable future. The fair value of each of our reporting units on December 31, 2010, substantially exceeded its carrying value. Commitments and Contingencies. We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. We record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known. 34 General Dynamics Annual Report Ÿ 2010 Table of Contents Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid. We have elected to defer (or inventory) these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts and recovered from the government. We expect to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. This business base includes numerous contracts for which we are the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on our best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. Our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. We determine the long-term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, future pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. For the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our commercial pension and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed under Deferred Contract Costs, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans. We have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. Accordingly, the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our future earnings either positively or negatively. We believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. See Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of these risks. The following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Foreign Currency Risk We had $1.8 billion in notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding on December 31, 2009, and $4.2 billion on December 31, 2010. The increase in the amount of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts is due to significant international contract awards in 2010. A 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following incremental pretax gains and losses: Gain (loss) 2009 2010 Recognized $ 4 $ 4 Unrecognized (79 ) (289) This exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar, euro/Canadian dollar and euro/pound Sterling exchange rates. We believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding losses and gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. We believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. Interest Rate Risk Our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations and variable-rate commercial paper. On December 31, 2010, we had $3.1 billion par value of fixed-rate debt. We had no commercial paper outstanding on December 31, 2010. Our fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable, and we do not trade these securities in the market. A 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations. Investment Risk Our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of one year. On December 31, 2010, we held $2.8 billion in cash and equivalents and marketable securities. Our marketable securities have an average duration of two months and an average credit rating of AA. Given that our investments had an aggregate weighted average maturity of less than one month on December 31, 2010, a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates or market values.

40533,GD,GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP,2012,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For an overview of our business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT The nation’s engagement in combating threats to U.S. national security around the world, coupled with the need to equip and modernize U.S. military forces, drives Department of Defense (DoD) funding requirements. As a defense contractor, our financial performance is impacted by the allocation and prioritization of U.S. defense spending. Procurement and research and development (R&D) budgets, also known as investment accounts, provide the majority of our U.S. defense revenues. For fiscal year (FY) 2012, the DoD received funding of $531 billion, including approximately $177 billion for procurement and R&D. This funding was approximately $22 billion less than the President’s FY 2012 request due to the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011. The BCA, which became law in August 2011, has two primary parts. The first mandates a $487 billion reduction to previously-planned defense spending over the next decade. The second part is a sequester mechanism that would impose an additional $500 billion of cuts on defense funding between FY 2013 and FY 2021 if the Congress does not identify a means to reduce the U.S. deficit by $1.2 trillion. As of February 17, 2012, the Congress has not identified these required savings. If the Congress does not identify the required reduction, defense spending would likely sustain further cuts. For FY 2013, the President has requested total defense funding of $525 billion, including $168 billion for investment accounts. In accordance with the first part of the BCA, the DoD’s five-year spending plan submitted with the FY 2013 funding request incorporates $259 billion of cuts when compared with the previous five-year plan. However, the spending plan does not include the impact of sequestration, the second part of the BCA. Despite these additional cuts, investment accounts are projected to display modest growth throughout the five-year period, with procurement funding for mature programs growing and R&D funding for development programs declining over the period. Budget expenditures lag congressional funding, with appropriated money generally awarded over several years. A series of continuing resolutions over the past year has resulted in a protracted customer acquisition cycle that negatively impacted the flow of contract awards, particularly in our shorter-cycle Information Systems and Technology business group. The threat of further defense spending cuts and the potential for a fourth-quarter 2012 continuing resolution due to budget approval delays may further impact contract awards. While the U.S. budget deficit will continue to influence government spending decisions, we expect defense funding requirements to continue to be driven by the following: • support for the warfighter in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment, including the DoD’s increased emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region; • the number of troops deployed globally, coupled with the overall size of the U.S. military; • the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001; and • the need to modernize defense infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern-day warfare. With these budget uncertainties, the long-term success of our U.S. defense business is enhanced by the relevance of our programs to the military’s funding priorities, the diversity of our programs and customers within the budget, our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs, our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment, and our proven track record of successful contract execution. In addition, the continuing tenuous geopolitical landscape requires governments around the world to fund weapons and equipment modernization programs, leading to diverse defense opportunities. We continue to pursue opportunities presented by international demand for military equipment and information technologies from our indigenous international operations and through exports from our U.S. businesses. While the revenue potential can be significant, international defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing, changing priorities and overall spending pressures. As we broaden the customer base for our defense products around the world, we expect our international sales and exports to grow. In our Aerospace group, business-jet market conditions showed further improvement in 2011, particularly in the large-cabin market. The group benefitted from increased flying hours across the installed base, improved new-aircraft order interest and declining customer contract defaults. Continued investment in new aircraft products is expected to drive Aerospace’s long-term growth, particularly as the group remains on track to deliver its newest aircraft offerings, the G280 and the G650, in mid-2012. Similarly, we believe that General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 19 Table of Contents aircraft-service revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by continued growth in the global installed business-jet fleet. We are committed to creating shareholder value through innovative product development, disciplined program execution and continuous improvement initiatives. Our performance is measured in our sustained revenue growth, solid earnings and margins and efficient conversion of earnings into cash. Our record of excellent cash-flow conversion has enabled us to execute our operational strategy while providing us the flexibility to deploy our capital to further enhance shareholder returns through acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchases. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION We recognize the majority of our revenues using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The following paragraphs explain how this method is applied in recognizing revenues and operating costs in the Aerospace and defense business groups. An understanding of these methods is important to the evaluation of our operating results. In the Aerospace group, sales contracts for new aircraft have two major phases: the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s outfitting, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors. We record revenues on these contracts at two milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the outfitted aircraft. Revenues in the Aerospace group’s other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) completions and service businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of the service. Changes in revenues result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries (green and outfitted), progress on aircraft completions and the level of service activity during the period. The majority of the group’s operating costs relate to new aircraft production for firm orders and consist of labor, material and overhead costs. The costs are accumulated in production lots and recognized as operating costs at green aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. Thus, the level of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered. To a much lesser extent, the level of operating costs is impacted by changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot. Operating costs in the Aerospace group’s other OEMs completions and services businesses are generally recognized as incurred. For new aircraft, operating earnings and margins in the Aerospace group are a function of the prices of our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of aircraft deliveries between the higher-margin large-cabin and lower-margin mid-cabin aircraft. Additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margins include the volume and profitability of completions and services work performed, the amount and type of pre-owned aircraft sold and the level of general and administrative (G&A) costs incurred by the group, which also include selling expenses and R&D costs. In the defense groups, revenue on long-term government contracts is recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced or as services are rendered. As a result, changes in revenues are discussed generally in terms of volume, typically measured by the level of activity on individual contracts. Year-over-year variances attributed to volume indicate increases or decreases in revenues due to changes in production or service levels and delivery schedules. Operating costs for the defense groups consist of labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs and are generally recognized as incurred. Variances in costs recognized from period to period primarily reflect increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts and, therefore, result largely from the same factors that drive variances in revenues. Operating earnings and margins in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume, performance or contract mix. Performance refers to changes in profitability during the period of performance based on revisions to estimates at completion on individual contracts. These revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated contract value or the estimated costs required to complete the contract. Therefore, changes in costs incurred in the period do not necessarily impact profitability. It is only when total estimated costs at completion change that profitability may be impacted. Contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher- vs. lower-margin work on individual contracts and when aggregated across the contract portfolio. On an individual contract, higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) or type of work (e.g., development/production).

Revenues increased in the Aerospace group, primarily driven by initial green deliveries of the new G650 aircraft. This increase was partially offset by lower revenues in the Information Systems and Technology group’s tactical communication systems business, specifically on ruggedized computing products. Operating earnings declined in 2011, resulting in a 50-basis-point decrease in margins. While operating margins were up in each of the defense businesses, operating margins decreased in the completions business for other OEMs in our Aerospace group. The decrease was caused by the impairment of an intangible asset and losses on narrow- and wide-body completions projects. Product Revenues and Operating Costs Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 21,723 $ 21,440 $ (283 ) (1.3 )% Operating costs 17,359 17,230 (129 ) (0.7 )% Product revenues were lower in 2011 compared with 2010. The decrease in product revenues consisted of the following: Tactical communication products $ (447) Ship construction (279) Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions 548 Other, net (105) Total decrease $ (283) In 2011, tactical communication products revenues decreased, particularly on ruggedized computing products, driven by order delays stemming from recent Congressional continuing resolutions and a protracted customer acquisition cycle. Revenues were also down on several ship construction programs, most significantly on the DDG-1000 and DDG-51 destroyer programs due to award delays and on the commercial product-carrier program, which was completed in 2010. Offsetting these decreases were higher aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions revenues due to initial green deliveries of the new G650 aircraft. Product operating costs were lower in 2011 compared with 2010. The decrease in product operating costs consisted of the following: Tactical communication products $ (425) Ship construction (299) Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions 654 Other, net (59) Total decrease $ (129) The primary driver of the changes in product operating costs in 2011 was volume. In addition, aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions operating costs increased in our other OEMs completions business due to $150 of cost growth and penalties associated with delivery delays on several narrow- and wide-body completions projects and a $111 impairment of the contract and program intangible asset.

The increase in service revenues consisted of the following: Information technology (IT) services $ 322 Aircraft services 181 Other, net (9) Total increase $ 494 In 2011, growth on IT support and modernization programs for the DoD and the intelligence community, coupled with the acquisition of Vangent, Inc., resulted in higher IT services revenues. The growing global installed base of business-jet aircraft and increased flying hours across the installed base resulted in higher aircraft services revenues. Service operating costs increased in 2011 compared with 2010. The increase in service operating costs consisted of the following: IT services $ 281 Aircraft services 172 Other, net (60) Total increase $ 393 Service operating costs increased in 2011 due primarily to increased activity levels. In addition, the acquisition of Vangent, Inc., resulted in higher IT services operating costs. General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 21 Table of Contents REVIEW OF 2009 VS. 2010 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 31,981 $ 32,466 $ 485 1.5 % Operating costs and expenses 28,306 28,521 215 0.8 % Operating earnings 3,675 3,945 270 7.3 % Operating margin 11.5 % 12.2 % In 2010, our revenues and operating costs were up due to higher volume on aircraft services in our Aerospace group, U.S. Navy ship programs in our Marine Systems group and tactical communication systems and IT services in our Information Systems and Technology group, partially offset by lower U.S. military vehicle revenues in our Combat Systems group. Growth in operating earnings significantly outpaced revenue growth in 2010, resulting in a 70-basis-point increase in operating margins. While each of our business groups reported earnings growth, performance was particularly strong in the Aerospace and Combat Systems groups. Product Revenues and Operating Costs Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 21,977 $ 21,723 $ (254 ) (1.2 )% Operating costs 17,808 17,359 (449 ) (2.5 )% Product revenues decreased in 2010 compared with 2009. The decrease in product revenues consisted of the following: U.S. military vehicles $ (700) Tactical communication products 421 Other, net 25 Total decrease $ (254) In 2010, U.S. military vehicle product revenues decreased due to lower Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicle production and reduced activity on vehicle development programs. The increase in tactical communication products was driven by higher volume on the Warfighter Information Network – Tactical (WIN-T) program and several ruggedized computing products. Product operating costs were lower in 2010 compared with 2009. The decrease in product operating costs consisted of the following: U.S. military vehicles $ (695) Tactical communication products 369 Pre-owned aircraft (57) Other, net (66) Total decrease $ (449) The primary driver of the changes in product operating costs in 2010 was volume. In addition, pre-owned aircraft operating costs decreased due to $30 of write-downs on the carrying value of inventory in 2009. Service Revenues and Operating Costs Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 10,004 $ 10,743 $ 739 7.4 % Operating costs 8,544 9,198 654 7.7 % Service revenues increased in 2010 compared with 2009. The increase in service revenues consisted of the following: IT services $ 397 Ship engineering and repair 199 Aircraft services 139 Other, net 4 Total increase $ 739 In 2010, IT services revenues increased due to higher volume on IT support and modernization programs for the intelligence community. Ship engineering and repair revenues increased, primarily on the U.S. Navy’s next-generation ballistic-missile submarine (SSBN(X)) program. Recovery in the business-jet market resulted in growth in aircraft services activity in 2010. Service operating costs increased in 2010 compared with 2009. The increase in service operating costs consisted of the following: IT services $ 363 Ship engineering and repair 185 Aircraft services 101 Other, net 5 Total increase $ 654 The drivers of increased service operating costs in 2010 were primarily due to increased activity levels on IT, ship engineering and repair and aircraft services. OTHER INFORMATION G&A Expenses As a percentage of revenues, G&A expenses were 6.1 percent in 2009, 6 percent in 2010 and 6.2 percent in 2011. G&A expenses as a percentage of revenues increased slightly in 2011 primarily due to higher ongoing R&D efforts in our Aerospace group. We expect G&A in 2012 to be approximately 6 percent of revenues. 22 General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Interest Expense Net interest expense was $160 in 2009, $157 in 2010 and $141 in 2011. The decrease in 2011 was largely due to the repayment of fixed-rate notes of $700 in the third quarter of 2010 and $750 in the third quarter of 2011, partially offset by interest expense associated with the $1.5 billion of fixed-rate notes issued in July 2011. We expect full-year 2012 net interest expense to be approximately $155 to $160, subject to capital deployment activities during the year. Other Income In 2011, other income consisted primarily of a $38 pretax gain from the sale of the detection systems portion of the weapons systems business in our Combat Systems group, partially offset by $17 of transaction-related costs associated with our 2011 business acquisitions. For further discussion of acquisition and divestiture activity, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective Tax Rate Our effective tax rate was 31.5 percent in 2009, 30.7 percent in 2010 and 31.4 percent in 2011. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to lower income from international operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 32 percent in 2012, an increase from recent years largely due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit that Congress has not yet extended for 2012. For additional discussion of tax matters, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Discontinued Operations In 2010, we completed the sale of our nitrocellulose operation in Spain. The operating results of this business are presented as discontinued operations, net of income taxes, in 2009 and 2010. In 2011, we recognized a $13 loss, net of taxes, from the settlement of an environmental matter associated with a former operation of the company. We also increased our estimate of continued legal costs associated with the A-12 litigation as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision that extended the expected timeline associated with the litigation, resulting in a $13 loss, net of taxes. See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the A-12 litigation, which has been ongoing since 1991. REVIEW OF BUSINESS GROUPS Following is a discussion of operating results and outlook for each of our business groups. For the Aerospace group, results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services, consistent with how the group is managed. For the defense groups, the discussion is based on the types of products and services each group offers with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to a group’s results. Additional information regarding our business groups can be found in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements. AEROSPACE Review of 2010 vs. 2011 Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 5,299 $ 5,998 $ 699 13.2 % Operating earnings 860 729 (131 ) (15.2 )% Operating margin 16.2 % 12.2 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 99 107 8 8.1 % Outfitted 89 99 10 11.2 % The Aerospace group’s revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase consisted of the following: Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions $ 531 Aircraft services 198 Pre-owned aircraft (30) Total increase $ 699 Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions revenues include Gulfstream business-jet aircraft as well as completions of aircraft produced by other OEMs. Gulfstream aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues increased in 2011 due to additional large-cabin green and outfitted deliveries, primarily initial green deliveries of the first 12 G650 aircraft in the fourth quarter. Offsetting this increase were lower completions revenues as a result of manufacturing delays on narrow- and wide-body commercial aircraft contracts and continued lower volume in business-jet aircraft manufactured by other OEMs. Aircraft services revenues, which include maintenance and repair work, fixed-base operations and aircraft management services, increased 15 percent in 2011, reflecting the growing global installed base and increased flying hours of business-jet aircraft. Revenues from sales of pre-owned aircraft were down slightly from 2010, and the group ended 2011 with no pre-owned aircraft in inventory. The group’s operating earnings decreased in 2011. The decrease consisted of the following: Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions $ (43) Aircraft services – Pre-owned aircraft 2 Selling, general and administrative/other (90) Total decrease $ (131) General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 23 Table of Contents Earnings from the manufacture and outfitting of Gulfstream aircraft increased approximately $240, or more than 20 percent, in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to initial green deliveries of the G650 aircraft. Earnings from other OEMs completions at Jet Aviation were down approximately $170 in 2011 primarily as a result of cost growth and penalties associated with delivery delays on several narrow- and wide-body completions projects, including $78 of contract losses in the fourth quarter. As a result of losses and lower revenues on other OEMs business-jet aircraft, we reviewed the related long-lived assets of the completions business in the fourth quarter of 2011 and recognized a $111 impairment charge on the contract and program intangible asset. We believe that major initiatives to reduce overhead and increase production efficiency undertaken by management beginning in 2011 will stabilize performance in the completions business in 2012. Despite the increase in revenues, aircraft services earnings were steady in 2011 due to competitive market pricing and an unfavorable mix of service work. Jet Aviation’s aircraft services earnings were also negatively impacted by the strength of the Swiss franc as compared to the broader market. The group’s operating earnings in 2011 were negatively impacted by higher R&D expenses and selling expenses associated with increased order activity. As a result of the factors discussed above, the group’s overall operating margins decreased 400 basis points in 2011 compared with 2010. The impact on the group’s operating margins from the impairment charge was 180 basis points. Review of 2009 vs. 2010 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 5,171 $ 5,299 $ 128 2.5 % Operating earnings 707 860 153 21.6 % Operating margin 13.7 % 16.2 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 94 99 5 5.3 % Outfitted 110 89 (21 ) (19.1 )% The Aerospace group’s revenues increased in 2010 primarily due to steady growth in aircraft services activity throughout the year. Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions work remained consistent with 2009 levels, as an increase in manufacturing volume was offset by reduced completions. Revenues from sales of pre-owned aircraft were down slightly from 2009. The group’s operating earnings improved in 2010 compared with 2009 across the group’s portfolio. Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions earnings increased primarily due to higher volume. Pre-owned aircraft earnings were up due to improved pricing in the pre-owned market and the absence of write-downs of pre-owned aircraft inventory that occurred in 2009. Aircraft services earnings increased consistent with the higher volume. Operating earnings in 2010 were also favorably impacted by lower R&D expenditures. Overall, the group’s operating margins increased 250 basis points compared with 2009. 2012 Outlook We expect an increase of approximately 15 percent in the group’s revenues in 2012 compared with 2011. The increase is due to additional green deliveries and initial outfitted deliveries of the G650. We expect the Aerospace group’s margins to be approximately 15 percent, up from 2011 due to improved performance in our other OEMs completions business. COMBAT SYSTEMS Review of 2010 vs. 2011 Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 8,878 $ 8,827 $ (51 ) (0.6 )% Operating earnings 1,275 1,283 8 0.6 % Operating margin 14.4 % 14.5 % The Combat Systems group’s revenues were down slightly in 2011 compared with 2010. The decrease in the group’s revenues consisted of the following: U.S. military vehicles $ (188) Weapons systems and munitions 19 European military vehicles 118 Total decrease $ (51) In the group’s U.S. military vehicle business, volume was down due to less refurbishment and upgrade work for the Abrams main battle tank, fewer survivability enhancement kits for the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle and a decline in activity on the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program as the system design and development neared completion. Increased volume on the group’s contracts to provide light armored vehicles (LAVs) for several international customers partially offset these decreases. Revenues were up slightly in the group’s weapons systems and munitions businesses. Increased sales of axles in the commercial and military markets were partially offset by the timing of munitions deliveries to the Canadian government and the sale of the detection systems business in the second quarter of 2011. Revenues in the group’s European military vehicles business increased in 2011 largely due to higher volume of Duro and EAGLE wheeled vehicles to a variety of European customers, including the Swiss and German governments. Offsetting this increase was lower activity on the group’s Pandur and Piranha vehicle contracts for various international customers. The group’s operating earnings and margins were up slightly in 2011, following a 130-basis-point margin improvement in 2010. The 10-basis-point increase in 2011 was primarily due to higher profitability on several major programs in our U.S. military vehicles business. 24 General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Review of 2009 vs. 2010 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 9,645 $ 8,878 $ (767 ) (8.0 )% Operating earnings 1,262 1,275 13 1.0 % Operating margin 13.1 % 14.4 % In 2010, the Combat Systems group’s revenues decreased compared with 2009 due to reduced volume in the group’s U.S. and European military vehicles businesses. In the group’s U.S. military vehicles business, lower MRAP vehicle production and reduced engineering work, primarily related to the 2009 cancellation of the manned ground vehicle portion of the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program, represented the majority of the decline in revenues. Revenues in the group’s European military vehicles business decreased due to the ramp-down of the Leopard tank program for the Spanish government and lower activity on the group’s Pandur and Piranha contracts. Despite the decline in revenues, the Combat Systems group’s operating earnings increased slightly in 2010, resulting in a 130-basis-point increase in operating margins compared with 2009. Productivity improvements across the group, particularly in the U.S. military vehicles business, and a favorable contract mix that included reduced engineering and development work resulted in significant margin expansion. 2012 Outlook We expect the Combat Systems group’s revenues to decrease to approximately $8.5 billion in 2012. A reduction in our U.S. military vehicles business primarily due to lower volume on the Stryker and MRAP programs will be partially offset by growth in international vehicle contracts and revenues from the December 2011 acquisition of Force Protection, Inc. We expect the group’s operating margins to approximate 2011 in the low- to mid-14 percent range. MARINE SYSTEMS Review of 2010 vs. 2011 Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 6,677 $ 6,631 $ (46 ) (0.7 )% Operating earnings 674 691 17 2.5 % Operating margin 10.1 % 10.4 % The Marine Systems group’s revenues decreased in 2011 compared with 2010. The decrease in revenues consisted of the following: Navy ship construction $ (153) Other Navy ship design, engineering and repair 230 Commercial ship construction (123) Total decrease $ (46) The group’s U.S. Navy ship-construction programs include Virginia-class submarines, DDG-1000 and DDG-51 destroyers, and T-AKE combat-logistics and Mobile Landing Platform (MLP) auxiliary support ships. Revenues were down slightly in 2011 on the Virginia-class submarine program from timing of construction activity as we transitioned from the Block II to the Block III contract. In 2011, the group delivered the eighth boat while construction continued on the next six boats. Deliveries of the remaining 10 boats under contract are scheduled through 2018. In our surface combatant business, the group received an award for construction of the second and third ships in the DDG-1000 destroyer program in the third quarter of 2011. Due to a delay in the award, revenues were down on the program in 2011. Deliveries of the three DDG-1000 ships under contract are scheduled for 2014, 2015 and 2018. On the DDG-51 program, volume was also lower as the legacy multi-ship contract neared completion with the remaining destroyer scheduled for delivery in 2012. In the third quarter of 2011, in connection with the Navy’s restart of the DDG-51 program, the group was awarded a construction contract for a DDG-51 destroyer scheduled for delivery in 2016 and won a competitively awarded option for an additional destroyer. Volume increased on the MLP program in 2011 as the group commenced construction on the first ship of the three-ship program. The first ship is scheduled for delivery in 2013. In 2011, the group also received a construction contract for the second ship and long-lead funding for the third ship. Activity on the group’s T-AKE program was down in 2011 as the group delivered the 11th and 12th ships in the program. The final two ships are scheduled for completion in 2012. While Navy ship-construction revenues were down from 2010, revenues were up in 2011 on engineering and repair programs for the Navy. Volume increased in 2011 on the group’s engineering work associated with the SSBN(X). The group currently is performing initial concept studies, including design of a Common Missile Compartment for the U.S. Navy and the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom, and reactor-plant planning yard services. The group’s repair work increased in 2011 following significant growth in 2010, particularly on surface-ship repair programs. This growth was aided by the 2011 acquisition of Metro Machine Corp., a surface-ship repair operation located in Norfolk, Virginia. This addition, coupled with our existing capabilities, enables us to deliver maintenance and repair services to the Atlantic and Pacific fleets. In 2010, the group completed construction of a five-ship commercial product-carrier program, resulting in a decrease in commercial shipbuilding revenues in 2011. Given the success of this program, the age of Jones Act ships and other factors, we anticipate additional commercial shipbuilding opportunities. Despite the decrease in revenues, the Marine Systems group’s operating earnings were up in 2011 compared with 2010, resulting in a 30-basis-point increase in operating margins. On the T-AKE contract, a modification negotiated during the year and favorable cost performance resulted in revisions in contract estimates that contributed 70 basis points to the General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 25 Table of Contents group’s 2011 operating margin expansion. This operating margin growth was offset by the absence of commercial ship construction revenues and operating margin compression as we transition to several new shipbuilding contracts and lower-margin service and design work increases. Review of 2009 vs. 2010 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 6,363 $ 6,677 $ 314 4.9 % Operating earnings 642 674 32 5.0 % Operating margin 10.1 % 10.1 % Revenues in the Marine Systems group were up in 2010 primarily due to increased activity on the Virginia-class program as the group continued to ramp toward construction of two submarines per year and higher volume on the group’s SSBN(X) engineering program. Lower activity on the DDG-51 and T-AKE programs and the completion of the five-ship commercial product-carrier program slightly offset other volume increases in the group in 2010. The Marine Systems group’s operating earnings increased in 2010 consistent with the increase in revenues as favorable performance on the T-AKE and commercial product-carrier programs offset a shift in program mix to new shipbuilding contracts and design work. 2012 Outlook We expect the Marine Systems group’s revenues in 2012 to decrease slightly from 2011 due to the timing of several ship-construction programs, with operating margins approximating 2011 in the low- to mid-10 percent range. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Review of 2010 vs. 2011 Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 11,612 $ 11,221 $ (391) (3.4 )% Operating earnings 1,219 1,200 (19) (1.6 )% Operating margin 10.5 % 10.7 % The Information Systems and Technology group’s revenues decreased in 2011 compared with 2010. The decrease in revenues consisted of the following: Tactical communication systems $ (623) Information technology (IT) services 339 Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems (107) Total decrease $ (391) Revenues in the tactical communication systems business were impacted unfavorably by recent continuing resolutions and a protracted customer acquisition cycle that slowed orders. This resulted in lower revenues in 2011 on ruggedized computing products, including the Common Hardware/Software III (CHS-3) program, and other products with shorter-term delivery timeframes. Additionally, revenues on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP) were down in 2011 as the group transitioned from production to the training and support phase of the program. Revenues were up in the group’s United Kingdom-based operation due to higher volume on the initial phase of the U.K. Ministry of Defence Specialist Vehicle (SV) program. In the IT services business, volume increased on the group’s support and modernization programs for the intelligence community and the Departments of Defense (DoD) and Homeland Security, including the St. Elizabeths campus, New Campus East, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and Mark Center infrastructure programs. Revenues also increased in this business as a result of the acquisition of Vangent, Inc., in the fourth quarter of 2011. Revenues were down in 2011 compared with 2010 in the group’s ISR business as a result of the sale of a satellite facility in 2010 and lower optical products volume. The Information Systems and Technology group’s operating earnings decreased in 2011, although at a lower rate than revenues, resulting in a 20-basis-point increase in margins compared with 2010. Higher margins in our tactical communication systems business were in part due to $95 of overhead reduction initiatives, but were largely offset by growth in our lower-margin IT services business. Review of 2009 vs. 2010 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 10,802 $ 11,612 $ 810 7.5 % Operating earnings 1,151 1,219 68 5.9 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.5 % The Information Systems and Technology group generated revenue growth in each of the group’s markets in 2010, with over 5 percent organic growth. Revenues increased on the WIN-T program and ruggedized computing products in the group’s tactical communication systems business. In the IT services business, higher volume on several IT support and modernization programs for the intelligence community accounted for the increase in revenues. The 2009 acquisition of Axsys Technologies, Inc., and growing levels of cyber security-related work contributed to the growth in the group’s ISR business. Operating earnings increased in 2010, although at a slightly lower rate than revenues, resulting in a modest decrease in operating margins compared with 2009. The reduction in operating margins resulted from a shift in the group’s contract mix to include a growing proportion of IT services work. 26 General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents 2012 Outlook We expect 2012 revenues in the Information Systems and Technology group to be consistent with 2011 as growth in the IT services business, driven by the acquisition of Vangent, Inc., is offset by continued revenue pressure in our tactical communication systems business. The group’s operating margins are expected to decline to the high-9 percent range due to the impact of continued revenue growth in our lower-margin IT services business. CORPORATE Corporate operating expenses totaled $87 in 2009, $83 in 2010 and $77 in 2011. Corporate results primarily consist of compensation expense for stock options. See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our stock options. We expect 2012 Corporate operating expenses of approximately $80. BACKLOG AND ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CONTRACT VALUE Our total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $57.4 billion at the end of 2011 compared with $59.6 billion at year-end 2010. Strong orders on major programs across our defense groups resulted in a book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by revenues) slightly higher than 2010, while our Aerospace group generated a book-to-bill ratio greater than one-to-one. Our backlog also increased nearly $1.8 billion due to our 2011 acquisitions. Our backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts or unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts, which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value. Customers use IDIQ contracts for several reasons, including expanding the field of available contractors to maximize competition under a given program or when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed. The estimated contract value includes multiple-award IDIQ contracts in which we are one of several companies competing for task orders as well as contracts where we have been designated as the sole-source supplier. We include our estimate of the remaining value we will receive under these arrangements. Contract options in our defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work at the election of the customer. These options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may procure additional units or services at a future date. Contract options in the Aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft and long-term agreements with fleet customers. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. On December 31, 2011, the estimated potential contract value associated with these IDIQ contracts and contract options was approximately $28 billion, up significantly from $21.8 billion at the end of 2010. This represents our estimate of the potential value we will receive. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower. The estimated potential contract value increased in 2011 in our Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups largely due to the DDG-51 option and Common Hardware Systems-4 (CHS-4) IDIQ contract awards. The acquisition of Vangent, Inc., in 2011 also added approximately $1.2 billion to the Information Systems and Technology group’s estimated potential contract value. We expect to realize this value primarily over the next several years, reflecting continued demand for our products and services well into the future. AEROSPACE Aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. Funded backlog includes the group’s newest aircraft models, the G650 and the G280, which are expected to receive full type certification and enter service in mid-2012. Aerospace unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The Aerospace group finished 2011 with a total backlog of $17.9 billion, up slightly from $17.8 billion at year-end 2010. In 2011, the group booked the highest number of orders for new aircraft since the introduction of the G650 in 2008. Customer defaults were down more than 15 percent from 2010. We balance aircraft production rates with customer demand to maximize profitability and level-load production over time. This has enabled us to maintain an 18- to 24-month period between customer order and delivery of legacy large-cabin aircraft, while the G650 has accumulated approximately five years of backlog prior to initial deliveries. Although we expect order activity to remain strong and customer defaults to remain at low levels, backlog will likely decrease over the next several years as we deliver on our G650 backlog and the time period between customer order and delivery of the aircraft normalizes. Over the past few years, the group’s customer base has become increasingly diverse in customer type and geographic region. Approximately two-thirds of the group’s year-end backlog is composed of private companies and individual buyers. While the installed base of aircraft is predominately in North America, international customers represent nearly 65 percent of the group’s backlog. Approximately 70 percent of the group’s orders in 2011 were from international customers, with significant growth in orders from the Asia-Pacific region. In 2011, Gulfstream received an $810 order from Minsheng General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 27 Table of Contents Financial Leasing, the Chinese financial leasing company of Minsheng Bank, for the purchase of 20 Gulfstream aircraft across the product portfolio over several years. In 2011, a fleet customer informed us of its intent not to purchase 40 large-cabin aircraft. We removed these aircraft from the group’s estimated potential contract value with no impact to annual scheduled deliveries. At year end, there were no options to purchase new aircraft or long-term agreements with fleet customers included in estimated potential contract value. DEFENSE GROUPS The total backlog for our defense groups represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of the defense backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, we have included in backlog only firm contracts we believe are likely to receive funding. Total backlog in our defense groups decreased 5 percent in 2011 to $39.5 billion at the end of the year, compared with $41.7 billion at the end of 2010. Over 70 percent of the decline during 2011 was in our Marine Systems group, which continued work on large, multi-year construction contracts awarded in prior periods. COMBAT SYSTEMS Combat Systems’ total backlog was $11.4 billion at the end of 2011, down slightly from $11.8 billion at year-end 2010. The group’s backlog primarily consists of long-term production contracts. The Army’s Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program represented $1.5 billion of the group’s backlog at year end with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2014. The group received over $1.4 billion of Stryker orders in 2011, including awards for production of 292 double-V-hulled vehicles and 100 Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicles, and contractor logistics support and engineering services. The group’s backlog at year end included $1.1 billion for M1 Abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs. In 2011, the group received awards totaling $380 for all Abrams-related programs. The group continued work on a multi-year contract awarded in 2008 to upgrade M1A1 Abrams tanks to the M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP) configuration. The group’s Abrams backlog at year end included $330 for the SEP program. Abrams backlog also includes $200 for Tank Urban Survivability Kits (TUSK), which increase the tank’s utility and crew survivability in urban warfare environments, and $310 for production of M1A1 Abrams tank kits for the Egyptian Land Forces under the Egyptian tank co-production program. The group’s backlog at year end also included $400 for the Technology Development phase of the Army’s Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program and $280 under the MRAP program, largely for upgrade kits for previously-delivered vehicles. The acquisition of Force Protection, Inc., in 2011 added $660 to the group’s backlog, including $200 for the Buffalo mine clearance vehicle and $185 for the smaller Ocelot light patrol vehicle. The Combat Systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog. The backlog at the end of the year included: • $1.5 billion for LAVs under several foreign military sales (FMS) contracts; • $915 for the upgrade and modernization of 550 LAV III combat vehicles for the Canadian Army; • $470 for the production of Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles scheduled for delivery to the Spanish Army through 2016; • $425 for Pandur vehicles for several international customers; • $315 for Merkava Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) hulls and material kit sets for the Israeli Ministry of Defense; • $150 for the design, integration and production of seven prototypes under the U.K.’s Specialist Vehicle program, in addition to the integration work being performed by the Information Systems and Technology group; • $85 for a contract with the German government to provide EAGLE IV wheeled military vehicles; and • $75 from the Swiss government to provide Duro wheeled armored personnel vehicles. The Combat Systems group’s backlog at year end also included $2.7 billion in weapons systems and munitions programs. In 2011, the group received awards totaling $630 for axles in the military and commercial markets and $305 for the production of Hydra-70 rockets. The group also received awards worth $335 from the Canadian government to supply various calibers of ammunition and $190 from the Marine Corps for ammunition for the Expeditionary Fire Support System. Combat Systems backlog does not include $3.5 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with the group’s anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. The group’s estimated potential contract value decreased approximately 25 percent since year-end 2010 28 General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents largely due to funding under IDIQ contracts and options that were then transferred to backlog, including the Hydra-70 rocket program. MARINE SYSTEMS The Marine Systems group’s backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts. The group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years. For example, in 2008, the group received a $14 billion contract for the construction of eight Virginia-class submarines to be delivered through 2018, increasing backlog to an all-time high of $26.4 billion at the end of 2008. Consistent with this historical pattern, as the group has performed on these multi-year contracts, the backlog has decreased to $18.5 billion at year-end 2011 compared to $20.1 billion at the end of 2010. While backlog decreased in our submarine business, backlog increased in both of our surface shipyards from major contract awards in 2011. The Virginia-class submarine program was the company’s largest program in 2011 and is the largest contract in the group’s backlog. The group’s backlog at year end included $11 billion for ten Virginia-class submarines. As the prime contractor on the Virginia-class program, we report the entire backlog and revenues associated with the program but share the construction activity and the earnings with our teaming partner. Plans published by the Navy include a request for proposals in 2012 for nine submarines under a fourth block of the program. Navy destroyer programs represent another significant component of the group’s backlog. These include the Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 and Zumwalt-class DDG-1000 destroyer programs. In 2011, the group received approximately $1.6 billion in orders under the DDG-1000 program, bringing the value in backlog to $1.8 billion for the construction of three ships, including two awarded in 2011, and continued engineering and support services. At year end, the backlog also included $620 for DDG-51 destroyers. The final destroyer under the Navy’s legacy multi-ship contract is scheduled for delivery in 2012. Additionally, in connection with the Navy’s restart of the DDG-51 program, the group was awarded in 2011 a construction contract for a DDG-51 destroyer and won a competitively awarded option for an additional destroyer. The Marine Systems group’s backlog at year end included $660 for the MLP program. In 2011, the group was awarded construction contracts for the first two ships in the program and long-lead funding for the third ship. The year-end backlog also included approximately $315 for the last two ships under the Navy’s T-AKE combat-logistics ship program and $160 for the group’s second ship under the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program, scheduled for delivery in 2012. In addition, the Marine Systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately $3.9 billion for engineering, repair, overhaul and other services. This includes $2.3 billion in design and engineering efforts for the SSBN(X). The group received several significant contract awards in 2011 totaling $645 to continue development work. Additionally, the acquisition of Metro Machine Corp. in 2011 added $485 to the group’s backlog for maintenance and repair services to be performed in Norfolk, Virginia. The group also received a $35 award in 2011 for the outfitting of the San Antonio-class amphibious assault dock ship (LPD) USS San Diego, with an option for work on two additional ships. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY The Information Systems and Technology group’s total backlog was $9.6 billion at the end of 2011, down slightly from $9.8 billion at year-end 2010. Backlog was impacted in part by award delays stemming from recent continuing resolutions. The group’s backlog does not include approximately $22.4 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. In 2011, funding under IDIQ contracts and options contributed over $3.9 billion to the group’s backlog, or over 35 percent of the group’s orders. The estimated potential contract value in the Information Systems and Technology group increased nearly 50 percent from year-end 2010, most notably due to the $3.7 billion CHS-4 contract award and the acquisition of Vangent, Inc., that added $1.2 billion. When combined, the group’s backlog and estimated potential contract value increased by 28 percent over 2010 to $32 billion. General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 29 Table of Contents Unlike our other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and has to be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards. Nonetheless, there are several significant contracts that provide a solid foundation for the business. Programs for the U.K. Ministry of Defence comprised $670 of the group’s backlog at the end of 2011. Work continued in 2011 on the demonstration phase of the Ministry of Defence Specialist Vehicle program. In this phase, the group will manage the design, integration and production of seven prototype vehicles. Work and the backlog under the contract are shared with the Combat Systems group, including a significant portion of the future vehicle production effort. The group has successfully fielded the Bowman communications system, the secure digital voice and data communications system for the U.K. armed forces, and is now performing maintenance and long-term support and enhancement activities for the program. The group’s backlog at year-end 2011 included approximately $330 for the Army’s WIN-T program. Information Systems and Technology is the prime contractor on this battlefield communications network. In 2011, the group received approximately $370 of awards for WIN-T. The backlog does not include $795 of estimated potential contract value for the WIN-T program awarded under an IDIQ contract. The Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog at year end also included $150 for the CHS-3 program to provide commercial and ruggedized computers, network equipment and software to the U.S. armed forces and other U.S. federal agencies. In 2011, the group received $250 in orders under this program, bringing the total contract value to more than $2.6 billion. The group also received an IDIQ contract award for the next phase of the program, CHS-4. The group’s backlog at the end of 2011 included approximately $755 for a number of support and modernization programs for the intelligence community and the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, including the St. Elizabeths campus, New Campus East, NETCENTS and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center infrastructure programs. In addition to these programs, the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2011, including the following: • $95 for production and support of U.S. and U.K. Trident II submarine weapons systems. The contract has a maximum value of $225 if all options are exercised. • $95 for the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) program to provide support for the Army’s live, virtual and constructive training operations. • $90 from Austal USA for combat and seaframe control systems for the next LCS, bringing the value in backlog to $225. Options to provide these systems for eight additional ships will be recognized as orders as they are exercised. • $65 under the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) program for development of the Navy’s next-generation tactical satellite communication system. • $55 for the production of over 6,000 radios under the Army’s Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Handheld, Manpack and Small Form Fit (HMS) program. Information Systems and Technology was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2011, including the following: • An award from the Army for ruggedized computing equipment under the CHS-4 program. The program has a maximum potential value of $3.7 billion over ten years. • An award from the U.S. Air Force under the Global Broadcast Service (GBS) program for the production of Transportable Ground Receive Suites (TGRS) and delivery of retrofit kits for previously delivered systems. The program has a maximum potential value of $900 over five years. • One of two awards from AT&T for the installation of generators at approximately 7,000 cellular sites. The program has a maximum potential value of $1 billion between both awardees over four years. • One of three awards from the Army to provide information systems engineering and IT support services to the Army’s Information Systems Engineering Command (ISEC). The program has a maximum potential value of close to $900 among awardees over five years. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation. This focus has afforded us the financial flexibility to deploy our cash resources to generate shareholder value while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities. In 2011, cash flows from operations exceeded net earnings for the 13th consecutive year. The $9.1 billion of cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase our common stock, pay dividends and repay maturing debt. Our net debt, defined as debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities, was $1 billion at year-end 2011, up by $655 from $378 at the end of 2010 largely due to the issuance of fixed-rate notes in 2011 and continued capital deployment activities. Our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks, commercial paper rated A1/P1 or higher and short-term repurchase agreements with direct obligations of the Spanish government as collateral. Our marketable securities balances are invested primarily in term deposits and high-quality corporate, municipal and U.S. government-sponsored debt securities. The marketable securities have an average duration of one year and an average credit rating of AA-. We have not incurred any material losses associated with these investments. On December 31, 2011, $635 of our cash was held by international operations and is therefore not immediately available to fund domestic operations unless the cash is repatriated. While we do not intend to do so, should this amount be repatriated, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax but would generate partially offsetting foreign tax credits. 30 General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,855 $ 2,986 $ 3,238 Net cash used by investing activities (1,392 ) (408 ) (1,974 ) Net cash used by financing activities (806 ) (2,226 ) (1,201 ) Net cash used by discontinued operations (15 ) (2 ) (27 ) Net increase in cash and equivalents 642 350 36 Cash and equivalents at beginning of year 1,621 2,263 2,613 Cash and equivalents at end of year 2,263 2,613 2,649 Marketable securities 360 212 248 Short- and long-term debt (3,864 ) (3,203 ) (3,930 ) Net debt (a) $ (1,241 ) $ (378 ) $ (1,033 ) Debt-to-equity (b) 31.1 % 24.1 % 29.7 % Debt-to-capital (c) 23.7 % 19.4 % 22.9 % (a) Net debt is calculated as total debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities. (b) Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity. (c) Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity. We expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short- and long-term liquidity needs. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three years, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. OPERATING ACTIVITIES We generated cash from operating activities of $2.9 billion in 2009, $3 billion in 2010 and $3.2 billion in 2011. In all three years, the operating cash flow was attributed primarily to net earnings. In 2011, operating cash flow also benefitted from customer deposits due upon receipt of provisional type certification of the G650. Cash from operating activities reflects contributions to our pension plans, which have grown in recent years from $300 in 2009 to $350 in 2011, with contributions of $500 expected in 2012. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to our expectations, the default termination ultimately is sustained and the government prevails on its recovery theories, we, along with The Boeing Company, could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.6 billion on December 31, 2011. If this were the outcome, we would owe half of the total, or approximately $1.5 billion pretax. Our after-tax cash obligation would be approximately $735. We believe we have sufficient resources, including access to capital markets, to pay such an obligation, if required. INVESTING ACTIVITIES We used $1.4 billion in 2009, $408 in 2010 and $2 billion in 2011 for investing activities. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities. Investing activities also include proceeds received from the sale of assets and marketable securities. Business Acquisitions. In 2009, we completed two acquisitions for $811. In 2010, we completed three acquisitions for $233. In 2011, we completed six acquisitions for $1.6 billion. We used cash on hand to fund these acquisitions. See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of acquisition activity. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $385 in 2009, $370 in 2010 and $458 in 2011. The increase in 2011 compared with 2009 and 2010 is due largely to Gulfstream’s $500, seven-year Savannah, Georgia, facilities expansion project announced in 2010. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $600 in 2012, or 2 percent of anticipated revenues, as work on Gulfstream’s facilities project increases. Marketable Securities. As a result of lower market interest rates, we expanded our investment strategy several years ago to take advantage of the additional return generated by available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities. Net purchases of these securities were $235 in 2009 compared with net proceeds of $115 in 2010 and net purchases of $49 in 2011. Other, Net. Investing activities also included proceeds from the sale of a satellite facility in our Information Systems and Technology group in 2010 and the detection systems portion of the weapons systems business in the Combat Systems group in 2011. FINANCING ACTIVITIES We used $806 in 2009, $2.2 billion in 2010 and $1.2 billion in 2011 for financing activities. Our financing activities include issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises. Debt Proceeds, Net. In 2009, we issued $750 of two-year fixed-rate notes. In 2011, we issued $1.5 billion of fixed-rate notes in $500 increments due in January 2015, July 2016 and July 2021. We used the proceeds from these fixed-rate notes in part to repay the $750 of fixed-rate notes issued in 2009. In August 2010, we repaid $700 of fixed-rate notes. We have no material repayments of long-term debt expected until 2013. See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including scheduled debt maturities. We ended 2011 with no commercial paper outstanding. We have $2 billion in bank credit facilities that remain available. These facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program. We also have an effective shelf registration on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 31 Table of Contents Dividends. Our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share on March 2, 2011, the 14th consecutive annual increase. The board had previously approved a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share in March 2010 and $0.38 per share in March 2009. Share Repurchases. Our board of directors has historically supported management’s tactical repurchase of our shares, typically in repurchase authorizations of 10-million-share increments. We repurchased 3.6 million shares on the open market in 2009, 18.9 million shares in 2010 and 20 million shares in 2011. As a result, we reduced our shares outstanding by 4.2 percent in 2011 and nearly 8 percent since 2009. On October 5, 2011, with no shares remaining under a prior authorization, the board authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million shares, about 3 percent of our total shares outstanding. NON-GAAP MANAGEMENT METRICS We emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. As described below, we use free cash flow and return on invested capital (ROIC) to measure our ability to efficiently convert net earnings into cash and earn a return on the deployment of that capital. Free Cash Flow. We define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our operations for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. Over the past five years, we have generated free cash flow from operations in excess of our earnings from continuing operations during the period at an average 107 percent conversion rate. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,952 $ 3,124 $ 2,855 $ 2,986 $ 3,238 Capital expenditures (474 ) (490 ) (385 ) (370 ) (458 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 2,478 $ 2,634 $ 2,470 $ 2,616 $ 2,780 Cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities 142 % 126 % 119 % 114 % 127 % Free cash flow from operations 119 % 106 % 103 % 100 % 109 % Return on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. Over the past five years, our ROIC has averaged 17.4 percent. ROIC is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Earnings from continuing operations $ 2,080 $ 2,478 $ 2,407 $ 2,628 $ 2,552 After-tax interest expense 89 91 117 116 106 After-tax amortization expense 99 100 149 155 163 Net operating profit after taxes $ 2,268 $ 2,669 $ 2,673 $ 2,899 $ 2,821 Average debt and equity $ 13,430 $ 14,390 $ 15,003 $ 16,587 $ 17,123 Return on invested capital 16.9 % 18.5 % 17.8 % 17.5 % 16.5 % 32 General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS On December 31, 2011, other than operating leases, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to our stock and classified in shareholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; or variable interests in entities that provide us with financing, liquidity, market-risk or credit-risk support or engage with us in leasing, hedging or research and development services. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on December 31, 2011: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 4,452 $ 178 $ 2,222 $ 1,486 $ 566 Capital lease obligations 2 1 1 – – Operating leases 1,137 234 342 206 355 Purchase obligations (b) 21,891 11,342 6,653 2,033 1,863 Other long-term liabilities (c) 16,034 2,763 2,190 1,885 9,196 $ 43,516 $ 14,518 $ 11,408 $ 5,610 $ 11,980 (a) Includes scheduled interest payments. See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of long-term debt. (b) Includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. This amount includes $15.7 billion of purchase orders for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we have full recourse under normal contract termination clauses. (c) Represents other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including the current portion of these liabilities. The projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management’s estimates, which are based largely on historical experience. This amount also includes all liabilities under our defined-benefit retirement plans, as discussed in Note P. See Note P for information regarding the plan assets available to satisfy these liabilities. Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period Commercial Commitments Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years Letters of credit* $ 1,430 $ 679 $ 560 $ 22 $ 169 * See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of letters of credit. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our long-term contracts and programs. Other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers’ compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft inventory, and commitments and contingencies. We make our best estimates on historical and current experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. We believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition. We account for revenues and earnings using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, contract revenue and profit are recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced or as services are rendered. We determine progress using either input measures General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 33 Table of Contents (e.g., costs incurred) or output measures (e.g., contract milestones or units delivered), as appropriate to the circumstances. An input measure is used unless an output measure is identified that is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion. We estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and the total estimated costs of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the loss in the quarter it is identified. We generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion (input measure). For our contracts for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft we record revenue at two contractual milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft (output measure). We do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of significant deposits from the customer and other factors. Accounting for long-term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenues and costs. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions that utilize the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers, program and operations managers and finance and accounting personnel to project the outcome of future events. These events often span several years, including labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. We include in our contract estimates claims against the customer for changes in specifications or other disputes when the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We include award or incentive fees in the estimated contract value when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. Estimates of award or incentive fees are based on historical award experience and anticipated performance. These estimates are based on our best judgment at the time. As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review our performance monthly and update our contract estimates at least annually and often quarterly as well as when required by specific events or circumstances. We recognize changes in estimated profit on contracts under the reallocation method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term. We use this method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates on our long-term contracts affect the period in which the change is identified and future periods. These changes generally reflect our current expectations as to future performance and, therefore, the reallocation method is the method that best matches our profits to the periods in which they are earned. Alternatively, most government contractors recognize the impact of a change in estimated profit immediately under the cumulative catch-up method. As a result, the impact on operating earnings in the period the change is identified is generally lower under the reallocation method as compared to the cumulative catch-up method. The net increase in our operating earnings from the quarterly impact of revisions in contract estimates totaled $350 in 2010 and $410 in 2011, reflecting favorable operational performance across our contract portfolio. Other than revisions discussed in the Aerospace and Marine Systems business groups’ results of operations, no revisions on any one contract were material. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Since 1995, we have acquired over 60 businesses at a total cost of approximately $22 billion, including six in 2011. In connection with these acquisitions, we have recognized $13.6 billion and $1.8 billion of goodwill and intangible assets, respectively. Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process that requires a significant level of estimation by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. These estimates require the use of judgment. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations. This requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows. This discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by “top-down” analyses, including a market assessment of our enterprise value. We have recorded no goodwill impairment to date nor do we anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to impairment in the foreseeable future. The fair value of each of our reporting units on December 31, 2011, exceeded its carrying value under the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. We review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses, where identified, are determined as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows. We recorded an impairment loss in 2011 related to our completions business as discussed in the Aerospace group’s results of operations. Commitments and Contingencies. We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. We record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is 34 General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not allocable currently to contracts. Such costs include a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid. We have elected to defer (or inventory) these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts. We expect to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. Our business base includes numerous contracts for which we are the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on our best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. Our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. We determine the long-term rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forward-looking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. For the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our commercial pension and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed under Deferred Contract Costs, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans. We have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. Accordingly, the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our earnings either positively or negatively. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. See Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of these risks. The following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Foreign Currency Risk. We had notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding of $4.2 billion on December 31, 2010, and $4 billion on December 31, 2011. A 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following incremental pretax gains and losses: Gain (loss) 2010 2011 Recognized $ 4 $ (57) Unrecognized (289 ) (176) This exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar, euro/Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar/euro exchange rates. We believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding losses and gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. We believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. Interest Rate Risk. Our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations and variable-rate commercial paper. On December 31, 2011, we had $3.9 billion par value of fixed-rate debt and no commercial paper outstanding. Our fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable, and we do not trade these securities in the market. A 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations. Our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years. On December 31, 2011, we held $2.9 billion in cash and equivalents and marketable securities, which had an aggregate weighted average maturity of less than two months on December 31, 2011. Our marketable securities have an average duration of one year and an average credit rating of AA-. A 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the value of the holdings. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates or market values.
